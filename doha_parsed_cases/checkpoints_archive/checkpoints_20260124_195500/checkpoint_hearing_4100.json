He is 25 years old. As \nof his February 2022 security clearance application (SCA), he was not married, and he \ndid not have any children.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the \nGovernment must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and \nother evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant \nor proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion \nto obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Section 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse as: \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. \nAG \u00b6 25 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I considered the following relevant: \u201c(a) any substance misuse . . . ;\u201d \u201c(c) \nillegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, processing, \nmanufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia;\u201d and \n\u201c(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, or failure to \nclearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse.\u201d \nApplicant used marijuana with varying frequency between 2014 and 2022. He \nused hallucinogens with varying frequency between 2014 and 2021. He also used \nstimulants, not prescribed to him, with varying frequency between 2017 and 2020. He \nstated in his SCA, during his background interview, and in his Answer that he intends to \ncontinue using marijuana and hallucinogens. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), 25(c), and 25(g) are \nestablished. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides the following potentially relevant mitigating conditions: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility; and \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness \nduring which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant last used hallucinogens less than two years ago, and he last used \nmarijuana as recently as October 2022. His use is recent enough that I cannot find that \nit is unlikely to recur. He indicated during his background interview that he continues to \nassociate with individuals who use drugs. He did not provide a signed statement of \nintent to abstain from all drug involvement and substance misuse, and he intends to \ncontinue to use marijuana and hallucinogens. He used stimulants that were not \nprescribed to him. I find that none of the above mitigating conditions are established. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline H in this whole-person analysis. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with \nquestions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the drug involvement security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nCandace Le\u2019i Garcia \nAdministrative Judge \n6 \n",

Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960); DoD Directive 5220.6 Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program, (January 2, 1992) (Directive); \nand Security Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing in Appendix A the National \nSecurity Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified \nInformation or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective June 8, 2017. \n1 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                      \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n             \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR (undated), and she elected to have her case \ndecided on the basis of the written record, in lieu of a hearing.

She claimed she filed her Chapter 13 petitions to \nconsolidate her debts and facilitate her making smaller payments. She further claimed \nthat while she \u201cis not very good yet,\u201d at managing her finances, she has never dodged a \nbill.

These guidelines take into account factors that could \ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as \nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. These guidelines include conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of \nthe conditions that could mitigate security concerns, if any. \nThese guidelines must be considered before deciding whether or not a security \nclearance should be granted, continued, or denied. Although, the guidelines do not \nrequire judges to place exclusive reliance on the enumerated disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a decision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context \nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \nFinancial Considerations \nThe Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts \nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules or regulations, all of which \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can \nalso be caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of \nother issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, \nmental health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or \ndependence.

Sept. 24, 2004). \nFinancial stability in a person cleared to protect classified information is required \nprecisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of a security clearance that \nentitles the person to access classified information. While the principal concern of a \nsecurity clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated difficulties is vulnerability to coercion and \ninfluence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in cases involving delinquent debts. \nHistorically, the timing of addressing delinquent accounts is critical to an \nassessment of an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment in following \nrules and guidelines necessary for those seeking access to classified information or to \nholding a sensitive position.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of\nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider\nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of EO 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order \nadverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall \nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO \n12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive \ninformation). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, corroborated by her credit reports, establish two \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d), and \nAG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). \nThe security concerns raised in the SOR may be mitigated by any of the following \npotentially applicable factors: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; and \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nNone of these are applicable. Apart from the charged-off debts of 1.a., 1.b. and \n1.j., which Applicant has only partially addressed by paying taxes on the charged-off \namounts, she has failed to address the remaining $23,263 of admitted past-due debts, \n1.c.~1.i. Applicant failed to meet her burden to mitigate the financial concerns set out in \nthe SOR. For these reasons, I find Financial Considerations against Applicant. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall common-sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \napplicable guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person. \nAn administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \n\u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis, \nand I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person, I conclude that Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised \nby her financial indebtedness. Accordingly, Applicant has not carried her burden of \nshowing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant her eligibility for \naccess to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a.~1.j: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or \ncontinue Applicant\u2019s national security eligibility for access to classified information. \nClearance is denied. \nRichard A.

(FORM Items 4-9) \nApplicant is a 50-year-old material handler senior specialist employed by a defense \ncontractor since August 2013. (FORM Item 11 at 4) He married in June 2010. He has four \nchildren, ages 24, 23, 11, and 8, and a 29-year-old stepdaughter. He told a security \ninvestigator that he pays child support to an ex-girlfriend. He did not identify which children \nwere born during the previous relationship, but his SCA reflects that three of his four \nchildren were born before he married. (FORM Item 11 at 5) His SCA reflects that he has \nnever held a security clearance. (FORM Item 3 at 32) \nApplicant attributed the debts alleged in the SOR to his wife being unable to work \nafter being injured in a car accident. He did not submit any evidence of efforts to resolve \nthe debts alleged in the SOR. He told a security investigator that he intends to work with \na debt-consolidation company, but that he has not yet found a company that fits his needs. \n(FORM Item 11 at 5, 11) He previously received a Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge in \nDecember 1999. (FORM Item 10) The bankruptcy discharge is not alleged in the SOR, \nand I have considered it only for the limited purposes of deciding which adjudicative \nguidelines are applicable and in my whole person analysis See ISCR Case No. 03-20327 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006). \n2 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence in the FORM establish two disqualifying \nconditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d) and AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca \nhistory of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). The following mitigating conditions are \npotentially relevant: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation,\nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n \n \n \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling\nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit\ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem\nis being resolved or is under control; and \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nNone of the above mitigating conditions are established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent \ndebts are numerous, recent, and there is no evidence that they were incurred under \ncircumstances making recurrence unlikely. The injury of Applicant\u2019s wife in an accident \nand the resulting loss of employment were conditions largely beyond his control, but he \nsubmitted no evidence of responsible behavior regarding the debts. He submitted no \nevidence of financial counseling, no evidence reflecting \u201cclear indications\u201d that his \nfinancial problems are under control, and no evidence of good-faith efforts to resolve his \ndelinquent debts. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Because Applicant requested a \ndetermination on the record without a hearing, I had no opportunity to evaluate his \ncredibility and sincerity based on demeanor. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. \nBd. Jul. 23, 2003). After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under \nGuideline F and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by his delinquent debts. \n5 \n\nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.s: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information. Clearance \nis denied. \nLeRoy F. Foreman \nAdministrative Judge \n6 \n",

Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.) \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \neligibility for access to classified information. \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines \nare applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind \nmight accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the \nrecord.\u201d  (ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.32.1)). \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a \npreponderance.\u201d (See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  \nCir. 1994).) \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive and has the burden of establishing \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as \nwell. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to \nrepose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants \naccess to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nFurthermore, \u201csecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of \ndenials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).) \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no \nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7) Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have \nbased this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to \nApplicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has \nor has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those \nconclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the \nrecord. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness \nto abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Financial distress can also be caused or exacerbated \nby, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of personnel security \nconcern such as excessive gambling, mental health conditions, substance \nmisuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. Affluence that cannot be explained by \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nknown sources of income is also a security concern insofar as it may result \nfrom criminal activity, including espionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \nThe SOR alleged six delinquent debts totaling approximately 22,637. Applicant \nacknowledged all of those accounts and did not dispute them; admitted that he had \ntaken no positive resolution actions regarding the accounts; and repeatedly stated that \nhe has no intention of paying any of those creditors. Instead, he said he was simply \nwaiting for the collections to be removed from his credit report due to their respective \nages. Based on those facts, as well as his comments regarding past financial struggles \nand current ability to pay those accounts, it is clear that AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(b), and 19(c) \nhave been established. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties under AG \u00b6 20: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply. Applicant noted that there had been \nperiods when work was slow and funds were limited, but he also acknowledged that, at \nleast since May 2021, he has funds sufficient to pay his debts. His newer accounts are \nreportedly current. However, he has repeatedly refused to indicate any good-faith effort \nto resolve his delinquent accounts \u2013 none of which he disputed \u2013 and is simply waiting \nfor them to be removed from his credit report. There is no evidence of financial \ncounseling. \nA debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent \nbecause \u201can applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct \nand, therefore, can be viewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating \nconditions.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case \nNo. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). \nBased on the evidence, it appears that Applicant has continued to ignore his \ndelinquent accounts for a substantial multi-year period. The overwhelming evidence \nleads to the conclusion that his financial problems are not under control or that he is not \ntruly interested in resolving them. His inaction indicates that he has not acted \nresponsibly. The Appeal Board has previously commented on such a situation: \nEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due \nto circumstances outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider \nwhether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when dealing \nwith those financial difficulties. ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. \nJan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); \nISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-\n13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether he or she \nmaintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial \npayments to keep debts current. \nAn applicant who begins to resolve his or her financial problems only after being \nplaced on notice that his or her security clearance is in jeopardy may be lacking in the \njudgment and self-discipline to follow rules and regulations over time or when there is \nno immediate threat to his or her own interests. (See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01213 at \n5 (App. Bd. Jun. 29, 2018); ISCR Case No. 17-00569 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Sept. 18, 2018)) \nIn this instance, Applicant has clearly stated an intention to ignore his delinquent \naccounts and he is simply waiting for them to be removed from his credit report because \nof their age. His actions \u2013 or inaction in this regard \u2013 have complied with his stated \nintentions. \nClearance decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines do not \nrequire an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the SOR. \nAn applicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take \nsignificant actions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant \nimmediately resolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, \nnor is there a requirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. \n7 \n\n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nRather, a reasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of \nsuch debts, or resolution of such issues, one at a time. Mere promises to pay debts in \nthe future, without further confirmed action, are insufficient. In this instance, Applicant \noffered specific statements regarding his refusal to address his delinquent accounts. \nThe Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition], an \napplicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the \napplicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not define the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d \nHowever, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith \u201crequires a \nshowing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, \nhonesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, \n2004) (quoting ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Jun. 4, 2001)). \nThere is clear evidence that while Applicant has a small monthly remainder \navailable for savings or spending, he has refused make any payments to the creditors of \nhis delinquent accounts. Applicant\u2019s position, under the circumstances, casts doubt on \nhis current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. See ISCR Case No. 09-\n08533 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2010). \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at \nthe time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); see also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, \n2006). \nThere is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant\u2019s financial considerations. \nApplicant is a 30-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving as a \nproduction planning associate since March 2018. He was previously employed by other \nemployers in a variety of short-term (generally less than 12 months each) positions as \nan interior installer (October 2012 \u2013 March 2018). He was unemployed during brief \nperiods in 2012, 2014, and 2017. He is a 2011 high school graduate. He was granted a \nsecret clearance in 2011 and 2019. . \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is simply more \nsubstantial and compelling. There are six delinquent debts totaling approximately \n22,637, including an involuntarily repossessed automobile. Those debts essentially \nbecame delinquent during the period 2014 \u2013 2017. Applicant acknowledged all of those \naccounts and did not dispute them; admitted that he had taken no positive resolution \nactions regarding the accounts; and repeatedly stated that he has no intention of paying \nany of those creditors. Instead, he was simply waiting for the collections to be removed \nfrom his credit report due to their respective ages. As of the date of this decision, he has \nfurnished no evidence to indicate any change in his position. Applicant\u2019s actions or \ninaction generate lingering questions if he is currently in a better position financially than \nhe had been, as well as continuing doubt about his current reliability, trustworthiness, \nand good judgment. \nIn ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008), the Appeal Board \naddressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in financial cases stating: \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d necessarily includes evidence of actual \ndebt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not \nrequired, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off each \nand every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he [or she] has \u201c. . . established a plan to resolve his [or \nher] financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d \nThe Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the extent to which that \napplicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible \nand realistic. See Directive \u00b6 E2.2(a) (\u201cAvailable, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be \nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u201d) There is no requirement that a plan \nprovide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a \nreasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of \nsuch debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first \ndebts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones \nlisted in the SOR. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                        \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nApplicant\u2019s track record of continued refusal to resolve his financial issues is \nnegative and disappointing. Overall, the evidence leaves me with substantial questions \nand doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of \nthese reasons, I conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns arising \nfrom his financial considerations. See SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) (1) through AG 2(d) (9). \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.f.:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is a 33-year-old engineer for a defense contractor. He has worked for the defense contractor since May 2016. He is not married and has no children. He earned his bachelor's degree in 2013. He was granted a secret clearance in July 2017. March 2014 and July 2015 violations of company\u2019s substance abuse policy. (Guideline E - SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b). Applicant admitted in his Answer to testing positive on company drug tests for marijuana in March 2014 and July 2015. After the positive 2014 test he completed a drug treatment program. During a random 2015 urinalysis he tested positive again for marijuana and was terminated. He cited succumbing to peer pressure for why he used marijuana again in 2015. (Item 5 at 6, 9.) From June 2006 until May 2022, used marijuana with varying frequency (Guideline H - SOR \u00b6 2.a). Applicant listed in response to interrogatories that he first used marijuana in June 2006, and he estimated he stopped using it either in April or May of 2022.

His \nadmissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of \nthe pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 33-year-old engineer for a defense contractor. He has worked for \nthe defense contractor since May 2016. He is not married and has no children. He earned \nhis bachelor's degree in 2013. He was granted a secret clearance in July 2017. \nMarch 2014 and July 2015 violations of company\u2019s substance abuse policy. \n(Guideline E - SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b). Applicant admitted in his Answer to testing positive \non company drug tests for marijuana in March 2014 and July 2015. After the positive 2014 \ntest he completed a drug treatment program. During a random 2015 urinalysis he tested \npositive again for marijuana and was terminated. He cited succumbing to peer pressure \nfor why he used marijuana again in 2015. (Item 5 at 6, 9.) \nFrom June 2006 until May 2022, used marijuana with varying frequency \n(Guideline H - SOR \u00b6 2.a). Applicant listed in response to interrogatories that he first \nused marijuana in June 2006, and he estimated he stopped using it either in April or May \nof 2022. Between June 2006 and February 2014, he used it on a weekly basis. From \nFebruary 2014 until his termination in July 2015 he used marijuana \u201cvery sporadically.\u201d \nFrom July 2015 until January 2016, he used it \u201cweekly to a few times a week.\u201d From \nJanuary 2016 until April 2022, he used marijuana \u201ca few times sporadically.\u201d (Item 5 at \n6.) \nFrom July 2017 until May 2022, used marijuana with vary frequency while \ngranted access to classified information (Guideline H - SOR \u00b6 2.b). Applicant \nadmitted he had a \u201clapse in judgment\u2019 when he \u201creturned to behavior\u201d that was \u201cnot \nacceptable while having a security clearance.\u201d He stated he let \u201cstressors get to [him].\u201d \n(Item 5 at 6.) On his 2021 SCA he disclosed he used marijuana occasionally from \nDecember 2018 until January 2019. (Item 3 at 36.) In response to interrogatories, he said \nhe used marijuana \u201ca few times sporadically\u201d from January 2016 until April 2022, (Item 5 \nat 6.) \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nJanuary 2019 arrest for possession of marijuana. (Guideline J - SOR \u00b6 3.a). \nApplicant admitted to being arrested for possession of marijuana. He was pulled over for \nfailing to stop at a posted stop sign. The officer smelled marijuana and questioned him. \nHe admitted to marijuana possession and showed the officer where it was in his car. He \nwas arrested and charged with \u201cPossession of Marijuana less than 2 oz.\u201d He has not \nheard anything further regarding the charge. (Item 5 at 14.) \nApplicant did not respond to the FORM, so he did not provide any updated \nevidence to be considered in mitigation. He stated in his SCA that he does not intend to \ncontinue using marijuana because he wants to retain his security clearance. (Item 3 at \n36.) He added in his interrogatory response he had \u201cno intentions of future use.\u201d (Item 5 \nat 6.) He provided no character evidence for consideration under the whole-person \nconcept. \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \nAnalysis \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are established for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and \n1.b. \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This \nincludes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n     \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of \nclient confidentiality, release of proprietary information, \nunauthorized release of sensitive corporate or government \nprotected information; \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other \nemployer's time or resources. \nApplicant\u2019s conduct in his workplace prior to having a security clearance reflects \nquestionable judgment and an unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. It also \ncreated vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, and duress. AG \u00b6 16(d) is therefore \napplicable. The general concerns about questionable judgment and an unwillingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations contained in the general personal conduct security \nconcern of AG \u00b6 15 is established. \nIn order to mitigate SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b, Applicant has the burden of establishing \none or more of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17. AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c) and 17(d) may have \nsome applicability. They provide: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur. \nAs to SOR \u00b6 1.a, Applicant acknowledges his use. He continued to use marijuana \nafter taking a position involving drug testing. He continued the behavior of using marijuana \nafter testing positive and after completing a drug treatment program. AG \u00b6 17(c) is not \napplicable. \nThe relevant issue under AG \u00b6 17(d) is whether Applicant\u2019s statement that he \nwould stop using marijuana to retain his job is supported by his actions. Applicant failed \na drug test after being placed in a treatment program. I conclude that the behavior is likely \nto recur. AG \u00b6 17(d) is not applicable. \nApplicant\u2019s conduct continues to cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment.

Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the record establish the following disqualifying \nconditions under this guideline, as detailed in AG \u00b6 25: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or    \nholding a sensitive position. \nApplicant admitted using marijuana from about June 2006 until May 2022. (SOR \u00b6 \n2.a). AG \u00b6 25(a) applies. \nSOR \u00b6 2.b alleges not only because Applicant used marijuana from July 2017 until \nMay 2022, but also because he did so while granted access to classified information. The \nportion of this allegation concerning marijuana possession (without regard to classified \naccess) is established but is also covered in SOR \u00b6 2.a. \nApplicant\u2019s answer did not address the status of his access to classified \ninformation at the time. He simply stated in his interrogatories that he held a clearance. \nFurther, eligibility for access to classified information and the granting of access to \nclassified information are not synonymous concepts. They are separate determinations. \nThe issuance of a security clearance is a determination that an individual is eligible for \naccess to classified national security information up to a certain level. Security clearance \neligibility alone does not grant an individual access to classified materials. In order to gain \naccess to specific classified materials, an individual must not only have eligibility (i.e., a \nsecurity clearance), but also must have signed a nondisclosure agreement and have a \n\u201cneed to know.\u201d See Executive Order 13526, dated December 29, 2009, at \u00a7 4.1.

AG \u00b6 25(f) does not \napply, and SOR \u00b6 2.b is concluded for Applicant. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable as detailed in AG \u00b6 \n26 to SOR \u00b6 2.a: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) providing a \nsigned statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \nAG \u00b6 26(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s marijuana use from about June 2006 \nuntil May 2022 is recent. His actions cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and \ngood judgment. \nAG \u00b6 26(b) is not established. Applicant admitted to using marijuana. His actions \nafter losing a job in 2015 for drug use and after being arrested for possession of marijuana \nare inconsistent with his statements that he intends to avoid future involvement with \nmarijuana to retain his position. The security concern regarding his drug involvement is \nnot mitigated. \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern for criminal conduct: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or\nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \n \nThe following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable as detailed in AG \u00b6 \n31: \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nState law enforcement executed a consent search of Applicant\u2019s vehicle and \narrested him for possession of marijuana. The above disqualifying condition applies. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable as detailed in AG \u00b6 \n32: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the offense; \nand \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited to, \nthe passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nAG \u00b6 32(a), (c), and (d) do not apply. Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct is serious. His \ncriminal conduct is unresolved and continues to cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, good judgment, and willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations. The above mitigating conditions, individually or collectively, are insufficient to \nalleviate those concerns given his history of using marijuana. He needs to establish the \ncharge has been resolved and a longer record of accomplishment of responsible behavior \nand compliance with rules, regulations, and the law before his criminal conduct can be \nconsidered mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                       \n \n \n \n           \n \n \n \n \n                     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines E, H, and J in my whole-\nperson analysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d).

On \nDecember 1, 2022, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudication \nServices (CAS) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under \nGuideline F (financial considerations). The CAS acted under Executive Order (EO) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant responded to the SOR on January 17, 2023, and elected to have his \ncase decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.

His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 35-year-old systems technician employed by a defense contractor \nsince October 2021. He served honorably in the active-duty U.S. Navy from 2010 until \nJune 2021 when he was medically retired. Prior to discharge, he worked and lived in \nanother state (S1) before being assigned to a position in the current state (S2), in about \nNovember 2018. Applicant was unemployed for about three months before acquiring his \ncurrent position in October 2021. (Items 3 and 4) \nApplicant is a May 2006 high school graduate. In September 2021, he enrolled in \na college program and continues to attend classes part-time towards his degree \ncompletion. He married in August 2016. He is father to three children ages 12, 6, and 4; \nand two stepchildren, ages 16 and 11. Four of the five children live with him and his wife \nin the family home. In August 2022, S2\u2019s child support services department sent a Wage \nGarnishment Order, or Income Withholding for Support (IWO) order to his employer for \ndirect withdrawal of his wages for child support. He had previously informed his employer \nthat the IWO order was forthcoming, explaining that his current resident state, S2, \nrequired him to pay child support pursuant to the IWO order, whereas his previous \nresident state, S1, did not have this requirement. (Items 4 and 8) \nThe SOR alleges eight financial issues, including seven delinquent debts totaling \nabout $28,700; and the IWO order discussed above. (Item 1) In his response, Applicant \nadmitted all allegations except SOR \u00b6 1.c. (Item 2) He attributed his financial problems to \nhis move in November 2018 to S2, a high cost of living state. He disclosed during his \ninterview that he was not financially savvy or [financially] smart and admitted to making \nfinancial mistakes, but stated he was addressing the problem. (Item 4 at 4). He hired a \ncredit repair company to help \u201cclean up\u201d his credit, confirmed by the company in a letter \ndated May 2, 2022 (Item 2 at 3) It reads: \nPlease be advised that [Applicant] has enrolled in our credit restoration \nservice to assist with the removal of any erroneous, inaccurate and obsolete \nderogatory credit information that has been reported to the three credit \nbureaus. Our restoration program also provides extensive credit education. \n(Item 2 at 3) He stated the company was assisting him with the removal of any erroneous, \ninaccurate, or obsolete derogatory credit information [from his credit reports]; and credit \neducation; but acknowledged the company was not a credit counseling service. (Item 4 \nat 6) He stated he initially hired them in 2019 (Item 4 at 2) and that he pays $69 per month \n2 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfor their service. (Item 2 at 3; Item 3 at 34; and Item 4 at 2 and 6) At the close of the \ninterview, he told investigators he would provide documentation and more details on the \naccounts; and that he was living within his means and paying off debts and would have \nno future financial issues. (Item 4 at 4) He failed to provide any documentary proof \nshowing the terms of the contract including the effective date and obligations of the \nparties. \nIn May 2022, Applicant earned a monthly salary of about $6,284 ($75,000 \nannually). He also received monthly Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) non-taxable \ndisability pay of about $2,871 ($34,400 annually). His additional financial assets included \na savings account of about $11,300; a checking account of about $5,400; and a company \n401(k) account of about $25,000. Applicant\u2019s monthly discretionary income, after all bills \nand expenses were paid, totaled over $4,000. (Item 4 at pp. 5 through 6) \nThe evidence concerning the financial issues alleged in the SOR is summarized \nbelow. \nSOR \u00b6 1.a: account charged off for $8,685. Applicant admits this debt. He \ndisclosed that he borrowed this money to catch up on bills before his discharge from the \nNavy. He states he was paying $325 monthly; and that he missed a few payments, but \nultimately \u201ccaught up\u201d in May 2022. (Item 4 at 3). He later stated in his SOR response \nthat he made payments until he lost his job due [to his] clearance. He stated he \u201c[has] \nbeen in touch with [the creditor] and making strides to get [his] account back to positive.\u201d \n(Item 2 at 1). No further information was disclosed in his SOR response concerning any \nloss of employment referenced here. This debt, opened in March 2021, appears in all \nthree credit bureau reports. In January 2022, it was 60 days past due with a balance of \n$7,758. (Item 7 at 6). The past-due balance became $8685 in about June 2022; and the \naccount was ultimately charged off to profit and loss. (Item 6 at 2 and Item 5 at 4) This \ndebt is unresolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b: account in collection for $4,653. Applicant admits this debt. He \ndisclosed that in about October 2020 he changed phone providers; and that, though he \npaid his bill in full and returned the leased devices, the company charged him for early \ntermination of services. (Item 4 at 3) He states he contacted the company and was waiting \nto hear back. (Item 3 at 39; and Item 4 at 3) His comments in his SOR response are \ninconsistent with previous factual comments about this debt. (See Item 2 at 1) This debt \nwas assigned in about January 2022 and remained in a collection status after he or his \ncredit repair company disputed it. (Item 6 at 2, and Item 7 at 3). This debt is unresolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.c: account in collection for $192. Applicant denies this debt, stating he \nhas never associated with the company. This debt is identified as an individual account \nthat was placed for collection in July 2022. (Item 6 at 2) It does not appear in Item 5, the \nmost recent credit bureau report. This debt is resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.d: account charged off for $13,049. Applicant admits this debt. He \ndisclosed this was a voluntary repossession of a car he previously owned.

This debt is unresolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.e: account past-due balance of $200 with a total balance of $475. \nApplicant admits this debt, and stated he is in contact with the creditor. He offers no \nadditional comments or documents on the current status of this debt. (Item 2 at 1) His last \npayment on the debt was in December 2021. It was ultimately charged off in about August \n2022. (Item 5 at 9) This debt is unresolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.f: account in collection for $1,304. Applicant admits this debt. He \ndisclosed this debt was caused by a gap in insurance coverage after a car accident where \nhis car was a total loss. He agreed to pay $110 per month until resolved but he failed to \npay the debt. (Item 4 at 36) The record shows Applicant disputed the debt in about \nDecember 2021; but he offers no explanation, information, or documented proof \nindicating the reason or basis for the dispute. (Item 7 at 3) The debt does not appear in \nthe two later credit bureau reports. (Items 5 and 6) This debt is unresolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.g: account in collection for $650. Applicant admits this debt. He \ndisclosed that he purchased a service for his parents and that they paid the account for \na few years but stopped paying the bill and failed to return the equipment. He stated he \nis in contact with the creditor but also working with his credit repair company to \u201cclear his \ncredit.\u201d (Item 2 at 1). The record shows he or his credit repair representative disputed the \ndebt but he offers no explanation, information, or documented proof indicating the reason \nor basis for the dispute. (Item 7 at 4) The debt does not appear in the two later credit \nbureau reports. (Items 5 and 6) This debt is unresolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.h: wage garnishment for child support and child support arrears. \nApplicant admits this debt with explanation. He disclosed that he reported this \ngarnishment order for child support to his employer, explaining his previous state, S1, did \nnot require child support payments via direct garnishment or IWO orders, unlike S2. \n(Items 4 and 8) This statement is supported in Item 8. The issue is resolved. \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d EO 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d EO 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has \nnot met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd.

Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems including multiple delinquent debts. \nHe initially experienced some financial hardship after moving to S2, a high cost of living \nstate in 2018; and during his brief unemployed period in 2021. In May 2022, he reported \nmonthly discretionary income exceeding $4,000, in addition to healthy savings, checking, \nand 401(k) account balances. He had the available means to pay delinquent debts, but \nfailed to do so. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), and 19(c) are applicable. \nApplicant denied the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c, stating he never associated with the \ncompany. The debt initially appeared as an individual account placed for collection in July \n2022; however, it did not appear in the later credit bureau report. This debt is resolved in \nApplicant\u2019s favor.  \nApplicant admitted the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.h, with explanation. He reported the \ngarnishment order for child support to his employer, explaining his previous state did not \nrequire child support payments by direct garnishment or IWO orders, unlike the current \nstate, a statement supported by the evidence. This issue is resolved in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20.

Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are numerous and \nongoing; his longstanding delinquent debts in the SOR remain largely unresolved. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not fully established. Applicant could have experienced financial \nstrain after moving to S2, a high cost of living state in 2018; and briefly during his three-\nmonth unemployment period, July through September 2021, prior to acquiring his current \nposition. However, he has not established he acted responsibly under the circumstances. \nApplicant admitted he was not financially savvy and that he made financial \nmistakes. Though he hired a credit repair company to help with financial issues, the \ncompany\u2019s primary purpose was to assist with the removal of \u201cerroneous, inaccurate, or \nobsolete derogatory credit information\u201d from reports of the three major credit bureau \nreporting services. There is no indication he took steps to substantively address his \ndelinquent debts. The fact a debt no longer appears on a credit report does not establish \nany meaningful independent evidence concerning the disposition of the debt. See ISCR \nCase No. 14-03612 at 3 (App. Bd.

Though a few delinquent debts alleged in the SOR \nwere disputed, Applicant did not elaborate on this aspect, nor did he present independent \nevidence supporting a reasonable basis to dispute any such delinquent debts. \nIn sum, there is insufficient evidence for a determination that Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems will be resolved within a reasonable period. I am unable to find that he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances or that he made a good-faith effort to pay his debts. \nHis financial issues continue to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and \ngood judgment. I find that financial considerations security concerns remain despite the \npresence of some mitigation. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance.

He continued to use it \nsocially with friends, at his or a friend\u2019s residence, between five times daily and five \ntimes weekly. He also ate edible marijuana brownies once every three to six months. He \nalso purchased it for his personal use.

He stated that \nboth friends respect his decision to focus on progressing in his career and abstaining \nfrom marijuana. His parents and sibling are aware of his marijuana involvement. (Items \n1-4) \nApplicant also used and purchased hallucinogens, including lysergic acid \ndiethylamide (LSD) and psilocybin mushrooms, with varying frequency and on various \noccasions, from approximately December 2015 to September 2016. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, \n2.a) He was introduced to hallucinogens in high school by friends with whom he no \nlonger associates. He used LSD approximately three times and psilocybin mushrooms \nonce, out of curiosity and social pressure. He contributed money so that his friends \ncould purchase these hallucinogens from dealers. He found that the hallucinogens \nmade him anxious, which he did not enjoy, so he decided to never use them again. He \nstated in his FORM Response that he has removed himself from the individuals with \nwhom he used hallucinogens, and that he remained in contact with one individual, who \n\u201cis rarely in my life, with only occasional text messages.\u201d (Items 1-4; AE A) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process.

The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Section 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse  \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse as: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. \nAG \u00b6 25 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I considered the following relevant: \u201c(a) any substance misuse . . . ;\u201d \u201c(c) \nillegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, processing, \nmanufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia;\u201d and \n\u201c(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, or failure to \nclearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse.\u201d \nApplicant used and purchased marijuana between 2015 and 2022. He also used \nand purchased hallucinogens between 2015 and 2016. He continues to associate with \ntwo friends with whom he previously used marijuana, one of whom is his roommate, and \nhe knows that his roommate keeps marijuana or marijuana-related paraphernalia in \ntheir residence. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), 25(c), and 25(g) are established. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides the following potentially relevant mitigating conditions: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility. \nApplicant used and purchased hallucinogens four times between December 2015 \nand September 2016, nearly seven years ago. He removed himself from the individuals \nwith whom he used hallucinogens and has only rare text message contact with one \nsuch individual. AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a), 26(b)(1) and 26(b)(2) are established for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and \n1.d, and I find those allegations in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nApplicant used and purchased marijuana more extensively, between May 2015 \nand March 2022. His last use is recent enough that I cannot find that it is unlikely to \nrecur. He continues to associate with the individuals with whom he used marijuana, one \nof whom is his roommate. While he expressed his intent to continue to abstain from \nmarijuana, he did not provide a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse. I also have concerns about his willing awareness \nthat his roommate continues to use and store marijuana in their residence, despite him \ntelling his roommate to not do so. I find that none of the above mitigating conditions are \nestablished for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct  \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . . \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I considered the following relevant: \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the \nperson's personal, professional, or community standing; . . .  \nApplicant\u2019s parents and sibling are aware of his marijuana involvement, and his \nuse and purchase of hallucinogens happened nearly seven years ago. AG \u00b6 16(e)(1) is \nnot established and I find SOR \u00b6 2.a in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline H and Guideline E in this whole-person analysis. Overall, the record evidence \nleaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance. I conclude Applicant mitigated the personal conduct security \nconcern, but he failed to mitigate the drug involvement and substance misuse security \nconcerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c-1.d: \nFor Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

(TR at page 25 lines 9~13, PHXs B and F.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative \njudge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \nnational security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information.

Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations \nApplicant had past-due indebtedness of about $39,561. The evidence is \nsufficient to raise these disqualifying conditions. \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 including: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems are ongoing. He has a long history of \ndelinquencies. Applicant has yet to address admitted past-due debts totaling about \n$22,499. He has not demonstrated that future financial problems are unlikely. Mitigation \nunder AG \u00b6 20 has not been established. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with \nquestions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nFor all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the Financial \nConsiderations security concerns. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. and 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c.~1.e: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.g. and 1.h: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the \nDOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on February 6, 2023, and elected to have his case \ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the \nGovernment\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM), and Applicant received it on March 20, \n2023.

The case was assigned to me on June 1, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted both SOR allegations. After a thorough and careful review of \nthe pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 53 years old. He attended college but did not earn a degree. He \nmarried in 1997 and separated from his wife in 1999. He has no children. He has worked \nfor his present employer, a federal contractor, since December 2021. In his April 2022 \nsecurity clearance application (SCA), he did not disclose any periods of unemployment. \n(Item 3) \nThe SOR alleges a defaulted and charged-off mortgage (\u00b6 1.a - $39,289) and a \ncable bill (\u00b6 1.b - $131). Applicant disclosed the real estate debt in his SCA and stated: \nA second mortgage company purchased my mortgage so my automated \npayments were going to the wrong institution. When I realized the error I \nstarted making payments to the correct bank but they were rejecting \npayments. They added fees that almost doubled the mortgage so I let it go \ninto foreclosure.  \nThe case is closed and I have a check coming for the excess funds from \nthe sale. \nThe home was sold for more than I owed the bank. (Item 3) \nIn June 2022, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator. Regarding \nthe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a, he said that he owned rental property that was foreclosed. The \nbank sold his mortgage, and his payments went to the company. He received a judgment \nletter from the county court stating the home was in foreclosure. He said that he sold the \nhouse in January 2022 because the property was not being properly maintained, and he \nwas going to receive a refund because it was sold for more than what was owed. (Item \n6) \nRegarding the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b, Applicant told the investigator that he closed the \ncable account and received a refund. The following month, he was told he had a balance \nowed of $131. He said he spoke with the creditor at the time he received the new bill and \nexplained that he received a refund. He said he had no intention of paying it. In his SOR \nanswer, he admitted the debt.

(Items 4, 5) \nApplicant did not respond to the FORM and did not provide any documents to show \nthe line of credit account is paid and the debt resolved. He did not provide evidence that \nhe has disputed or resolved the cable bill. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handing and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant admitted he owed the line of credit mortgage account and cable bill \nalleged in his SOR answer. He told the investigator he was going to receive a refund from \nthe sale of his rental property. There is sufficient evidence to support the application of \nthe above disqualifying conditions. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nApplicant disclosed that he owned rental property. His mortgage was sold, his \nautomatic payments were sent to the wrong bank causing him to default on the mortgage, \nand the property was foreclosed. Applicant said it was sold for more than the mortgage \nand he anticipated receiving a refund. Although initially the foreclosure may have been \nbeyond his control, he failed to provide any evidence that the mortgage debt or cable bill \nare resolved, despite being put on notice that he was required to provide supporting \ndocumentation. None of the mitigating conditions are applicable. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline, F in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant failed to meet his burden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves me \nwith questions and doubts as to his eligibility and suitability for a security clearance.

After a thorough and careful review of the \npleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 23-year-old contractor. (Item 3 at 3) He has never been married and \nhas no children. (Item 3 at 18-19) He earned his associate degree in May 2020 and \nbachelor\u2019s degree in May 2022. (Item 3 at 9-10) He has been employed as a contractor \nsince June 2021. (Item 3 at 11) He has not served in the military. (Item 3 at 16) \nThe allegations in the SOR concern Applicant\u2019s sporadic use of marijuana from \nabout June 2016 to about March 2022 (SOR \u00b6 1.a); his use of hallucinogenic mushrooms \non approximately three occasions between June 2020 and November 2021 (SOR \u00b6 1.b); \nand his use of cocaine on approximately two occasions between July 2020 and June \n2021 (SOR \u00b6 1.c). \nApplicant used marijuana recreationally with varying frequency while in high school \nand college, from about June 2016 to March 2022. Applicant believes he used marijuana \non no more than 40 occasions over that six-year period. While in college, he used \nhallucinogenic mushrooms on approximately three occasions between June 2020 and \nNovember 2021 and he used cocaine on approximately two occasions between July 2020 \nand June 2021. (Items 2-4 and Applicant\u2019s Response to the FORM) \nApplicant admitted his use of drugs in his SCA, in his adopted subject interview of \nJuly 5, 2022, in his answer to the SOR, and in his response to the FORM.

His statements have remained consistent. He stated \nhe has not used hallucinogenic mushrooms for over 18 months, cocaine for almost two \nyears, and marijuana for over a year. He further stated he no longer associates with \nfriends who continue to use drugs. In his subject interview, he provided the names those \nwith whom he used drugs and contact information for the friends he still associated with \nbut whom, he said, also no longer use illegal drugs. He stated he regrets his former drug \nuse, it was foolish and immature, and he pledges to abstain from any future use. (Items \n3-4 and Applicant\u2019s Response to the FORM) \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard \nindicates that security determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d 484 \nU.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship transcends \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nnormal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government reposes a \nhigh degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nAG \u00b6 24 articulates the security concern regarding drug involvement: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription drugs, and the use of other substances that can cause physical \nor mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their \nintended use can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness, both because such behavior may lead to physical or \npsychological impairment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. Controlled \nsubstance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as defined in 21 U.S.C 802. \nSubstance misuse is the generic term adopted in this guideline to describe \nany of the behaviors listed above. \nApplicant admitted his drug use in his May 2022 SCA, his July 2022 interview with \na government investigator, his answer to the SOR, and his March 2023 response to the \nFORM. His drug use has been relatively recent. \nI have considered the disqualifying conditions for drug involvement under AG \u00b6 25 \nand the following are potentially applicable: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia. \nAG \u00b6 25(a) applies because the illegal use of marijuana, hallucinogenic \nmushrooms, and cocaine, all Schedule I controlled substances under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812(c), \nconstitute substance misuse. AG \u00b6 25(c) also applies. \nI have considered the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, \nand has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited \nto:  \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;  \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \nConsidering all the evidence, mitigating conditions AG \u00b6 26(a) and AG \u00b6 26(b)(1)-\n(3) are satisfied.  Applicant acknowledged his prior drug use in his SCA. He states he has \ndisassociated himself from his prior drug-using friends. His last drug use was in college, \nand he graduated in May 2022. He stated in his SCA and in his response to the FORM \nthat he intends to abstain from all drug involvement and understands any such \ninvolvement could affect his eligibility. He has established a pattern of abstinence and \nthough the time period has been relatively short, his statements appear to be sincere.  \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline H in my whole-person analysis. \nThe use of illegal substances is incompatible with eligibility for a security clearance \nand can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. Applicant is \ncautioned that any future use of an illegal substance could render him ineligible to hold a \nsecurity clearance. \nI conclude Applicant provided sufficient evidence to mitigate the security concerns \nabout his drug involvement and substance misuse. Overall, the record evidence leaves \nme satisfied as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all the circumstances presented, it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance.

His admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and evidence submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact: Applicant is 63 years old. He is married and has three adult children. He graduated high school in 1978 and took some college courses through 1982 but did not receive a degree. He obtained his first security clearance in 1987 and has held a security clearance for most of his career. He has been with his current employer as a network engineer since 2018. (GX 2, 3) The SOR allegations concern a charged-off home equity loan of $89,482; five delinquent student loans totaling about $77,000; several years of unfiled federal and state income tax returns; about $25,000 in delinquent federal income taxes; and about $4,000 in delinquent state income taxes. The home equity and student loan debts are established by Applicant\u2019s credit reports from December 2019, April 2020, and May 2022, as well as his admissions.

He elected a decision on the written record by an administrative judge from \nthe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), in lieu of a hearing. On December \n27, 2022, Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s File of Relevant Material \n(FORM), including exhibits (GX) 1 through 7. Applicant received the FORM on January \n5, 2023.

He responded on January 20, 2023, and provided \na statement with additional information.

GX 2-7, AX 1-9, and the FORM Response are \nadmitted without objection. \nFindings of Fact \nIn his Answer, Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.f and denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and \n1.g-1.j with explanations. His admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After \na thorough and careful review of the pleadings and evidence submitted, I make the \nfollowing additional findings of fact: \nApplicant is 63 years old. He is married and has three adult children. He \ngraduated high school in 1978 and took some college courses through 1982 but did not \nreceive a degree. He obtained his first security clearance in 1987 and has held a \nsecurity clearance for most of his career. He has been with his current employer as a \nnetwork engineer since 2018. (GX 2, 3) \nThe SOR allegations concern a charged-off home equity loan of $89,482; five \ndelinquent student loans totaling about $77,000; several years of unfiled federal and \nstate income tax returns; about $25,000 in delinquent federal income taxes; and about \n$4,000 in delinquent state income taxes. The home equity and student loan debts are \nestablished by Applicant\u2019s credit reports from December 2019, April 2020, and May \n2022, as well as his admissions. The tax allegations are established by Applicant\u2019s \nJanuary 2020 SCA, April 2020 background interview summary, and his November 2022 \nInterrogatory Response. (GX 1-7) \nApplicant\u2019s financial issues began in 2016 when he started a new job. Within a \nfew months, his company changed the status of his position from W-2 employee to \n1099 contractor. As a result, the company stopped taking income tax deductions out of \nhis paycheck, but he did not timely pay the taxes when due. Soon afterwards, his pay \nfrom the company became erratic. The company also failed to submit required tax forms \nfor 2016 and 2017. In early 2018, the company abruptly stopped issuing any paychecks. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant resigned in April 2018. In 2019, he sued the company for lost wages and \nreceived a settlement of $45,000, minus attorney fees. (GX 3; AX 3-4) \nAlso in 2016, Applicant\u2019s parents became ill and moved in with him. He began \nmanaging their finances and medical appointments. Later that year, his father passed \naway, and his mother passed away in 2017. Applicant stated that the inconsistent \nincome and time spent caring for his parents led to financial strain. (GX 1-3) \nSOR \u00b6 1.a ($89,482) is a charged-off home equity loan that became delinquent \nin 2018. Applicant claimed he made multiple attempts to contact the creditor and set up \na payment plan. Eventually, he was informed the debt had been sold. He did not specify \nwhen this occurred. However, in about October 2021, a collection agency sued him for \nthe debt. Later that month, he settled with the agency and agreed to make $800 \nmonthly payments toward the balance of $94,282. Records show that he made timely \npayments from November 2021 through October 2022, and he intends to continue to \nmake payments. (GX 1-3, 5-7; AX 1-2) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b ($21,128), 1.c ($19,637), 1.d ($17,399), 1.e ($15,907) and 1.f \n($2,884) are delinquent federal student loans in collection. From about 2010 through \n2015, Applicant cosigned on student loans for both of his daughters. His first daughter \nmade payments on her loans. His second daughter did not. Applicant knew that his \nsecond daughter\u2019s student loans were in collection. However, he claimed he was not \nresponsible for the loans because his second daughter had agreed to pay them. (GX 3, \n5-7) \nIn his Answer, Applicant claimed his second daughter was working on a payment \nplan under which he would be removed from the loans after one year of timely \npayments. He was not aware of the status of his second daughter\u2019s payment plan but \nclaimed the loans had been removed from his credit report. The student loans still show \nas collection accounts attributable to Applicant in all the credit reports in the record. (GX \n1, 5-7) \nSua sponte I take administrative notice that, as of this writing, the repayment of \nseveral federal student loans has been in forbearance status due to the COVID-19 \npandemic under multiple Presidential Executive Orders since March 2020. Federal \nstudent loan payments remain paused until at least June 30, 2023. See \nhttps://studentaid.gov/announcements-events/covid-19. \nSOR \u00b6 1.g alleges that Applicant failed to timely file his federal income tax \nreturns for tax years 2016, 2017 and 2018. He denied the allegation but admitted that \nhe did not timely file his tax returns for those years, as alleged. Applicant attributed the \nfiling delay to his company\u2019s failure to issue tax forms in 2016 and 2017 and his own \nlack of funds to deal with the unexpected tax liability. (GX 1) \nDuring his April 2020 background interview, Applicant also attributed the delayed \nfilings to his own \u201cprocrastination.\u201d He stated his first daughter was an accountant and \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhad assisted him with his taxes. He claimed he had filed his 2018 tax return in spring \n2020, but did not provide any evidence of the filing. He intended on filing his 2016 and \n2017 tax returns by May 2020. (GX 3) \nIn his November 2022 Interrogatory Response, Applicant asserted that he filed \nhis 2016, 2017, and 2018 income tax returns in January and February 2022 and \nincluded an unsigned copy of his 2017 tax return. He also disclosed that his 2015 tax \nreturn was filed in July 2018 and his 2019, 2020, and 2021 income tax returns were filed \nin November 2022. These additional years of late tax filings are not alleged in the SOR. \n(GX 3) \nIn a November 2022 letter, Applicant\u2019s first daughter, the accountant, stated she \nhad been assisting him with his taxes since 2014. She first worked with a large \naccounting firm and opened her own firm in 2021. She detailed that Applicant brought \nhis 2016, 2017, and 2018 tax documents to her in May 2020. She claimed that the tax \nreturns for those three years were submitted to the IRS in January 2022. She blamed \ndifficulties within her own office for the additional filing delays. (GX 3) \nApplicant\u2019s daughter also stated that she helped him file his 2019, 2020 and \n2021 federal income tax returns in September 2022. She provided a summary of the \nfilings on her company\u2019s letterhead but did not include any documentation from the IRS \nconfirming these later filings. (GX 3) \nIRS account transcripts confirm that Applicant\u2019s 2016 tax return was filed in \nJanuary 2022. As of February 2022, account transcripts reflect that his 2017 and 2018 \ntax returns had not been filed. However, in a November 2022 correspondence, the IRS \nnotified Applicant that his 2017 tax return had been received, but could not be \nprocessed without the submission of additional information. The record does not contain \nconfirmation from the IRS that his 2017 and 2018 tax returns were filed. \nSOR \u00b6 1.i ($25,534) alleges Applicant owes delinquent federal taxes for 2017, \n2019, and 2020. He denied the allegation but admitted that he initially had a balance of \nabout $28,500 in delinquent taxes, of which he had paid $3,500. He asserted that he \nhad filed an Installment Agreement with his 2021 tax return and was paying $500 per \nmonth toward his delinquent taxes. \nAn undated and unsigned Federal Installment Agreement Request shows that \nApplicant proposed a payment plan of $395 per month. IRS account transcripts and a \npayment activity summary show that, in November and December 2022, Applicant paid \nabout $20,000 toward his delinquent taxes. Most of these payments were directed \ntoward his 2016 tax debt that now shows as paid. (GX 3-4; AX 6-7) \nIn the FORM Response, Applicant\u2019s daughter the accountant stated that \nApplicant had submitted his 2021 tax return and that he was current with his tax \nobligations.

He denied the allegation but admitted that he did not timely \nfile his tax returns for those years, as alleged. Applicant asserted that his state income \ntax returns had been filed and the timing of those filings mirrored his federal filings. \nState tax documents from August through November 2022 support Applicant\u2019s assertion \nthat the state tax returns were received and processed. These include a Notice of State \nTax Computation, Notices of Intercepted Refunds, and the issuance of a refund. (GX 1, \n3; AX 5, 8-9) \nSOR \u00b6 1.j ($3,797) alleges Applicant owes delinquent state taxes for 2016 and \n2017. He admitted that he previously owed the state delinquent taxes, but claims he has \nsince paid the taxes in full. Applicant claimed that refunds for tax years 2019, 2020 and \n2021 were partially intercepted to satisfy his state tax debt. State tax documents confirm \nthat the tax debt for 2016 and 2017 was paid through intercepted refunds. The \nremaining funds were released to him. (GX 1, 3; AX 5, 8-9) \nApplicant asserted that he was \u201casset heavy\u201d with about $5,000,000 in assets. \nHis daughter the accountant stated that he continues to pay over the agreed monthly \ninstallment toward his tax debt and he will continue to be current on his future tax \nliabilities. She also provided character evidence in which she described him as having \ngreat judgment and self-discipline and was of high character, integrity and credibility. \n(GX 3; FORM Response) \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard \nindicates that security determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \n484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988) \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on \nmere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \nThe financial security concern is broader than the possibility that an individual \nmight knowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money.

May 1, \n2012) \nWhile difficulty in meeting financial obligations may force an applicant to choose \nthe order in which he or she addresses unpaid debts, they do not provide a plausible \nexcuse for failing to meet an important legal requirement, such as filing returns when \ndue. ISCR Case No. 15-03019 at 6 (App. Bd. Jul. 5, 2017) Failure to file tax returns \nsuggests that an applicant has a problem complying with well-established governmental \nrules and systems.

Dec. 20, \n2002) \nThe adjudicative guideline notes several conditions that could raise security \nconcerns under AG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income taxes as \nrequired. \nApplicant failed to timely file his federal and state income tax returns for 2016, \n2017 and 2018 as required. He owed delinquent taxes for several years. He also had a \nsubstantial home equity loan charged off for failure to pay. Despite having the apparent \nfinancial means to do so, he refused to pay the delinquent student loans that he \ncosigned for his second daughter. The above disqualifying conditions apply. \nThere are five conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security concerns \narising from Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties:  \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nIn 2016, Applicant was not prepared to navigate the change of his employment \nstatus from W-2 company employee to 1099 contractor. He also experienced erratic pay \nthat ultimately led to his resignation and the filing of a lawsuit against the company for \nlost wages. At the same time, Applicant took on the responsibility of caring for both of \nhis parents until their passing. These were circumstances beyond his control. \nApplicant also took some steps toward addressing his financial situation. Over \nthe last two years, he established and maintained a payment plan to resolve his \ncharged-off home equity loan. In addition, he recently made significant payments toward \nhis federal tax debt and is maintaining a payment plan for the remaining balance. He \nalso resolved his state tax debt through payment. \nHowever, Applicant has not taken responsibility for the $77,000 in cosigned \nstudent loan debt. These loans were already delinquent for years prior to the COVID-\nrelated moratorium on payments, and the credit reports in the record show the loans are \nstill in collection status. He remains obligated to pay the loans. By selectively \ndisregarding substantial debts, he has not shown responsible action under the \ncircumstances. Neither AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) or 20(d) fully apply. \nApplicant has also made some progress toward addressing his tax issues. \nRecently, he made significant payments toward his federal tax debt and is issuing \nmonthly payments for the remainder under an installment agreement. He has also \nresolved his state tax debt. \nHowever, Applicant failed to file his 2016, 2017 and 2018 federal and state \nincome tax returns on time as required. While he described his company\u2019s inability to \nprovide necessary tax forms as the primary reason for the delay, other contributing \nfactors included his own lack of funds and admitted procrastination. He did not begin to \naddress the filings until 2020, when he submitted paperwork to his daughter the \naccountant. Her office then took nearly two years to submit the tax returns. While she \nattempted to take responsibility for the delay, this is not an isolated event for Applicant. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe record reflects that Applicant additionally failed to timely file his 2015, 2019, \n2020 and 2021 federal and state income tax returns. These late-filed returns are not \nalleged in the SOR, but they undercut assertions of mitigation and changed \ncircumstances because his tax filing problems are ongoing. Even with the assistance of \nhis daughter, Applicant has not established that he is able to meet his tax obligations as \nrequired. His payment efforts do not mitigate his failures to file his tax returns in a timely \nmanner for several years. AG \u00b6 20(g) does not fully apply. \nApplicant has entered into a payment agreement on his charged-off home equity \nloan and made significant payments toward his tax debt. He also received some \nassistance from his daughter, the accountant, to bring his tax obligations current. \nHowever, the delinquent student loans for which he cosigned remain ongoing and \nunresolved. He has not yet shown he can consistently meet his tax obligations. He has \nnot established that his delinquent debts or tax issues are due to circumstances that are \nunlikely to recur or no longer cast doubt on his judgment, trustworthiness, and reliability. \nNeither AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) or 20(c) fully apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant first obtained a security clearance in 1987 and has held a clearance for \nmost of his career. His financial issues began in 2016 when his company failed to meet \ntheir pay schedule or issue necessary tax documents. At the same time, he had to \nmanage the care of both of his parents who passed away just over a year apart from \neach other. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nSince obtaining his current employment in 2018, Applicant has made some \nprogress in addressing his debts, including entering into a payment plan for his home \nequity loan and paying a majority of his delinquent taxes. However, he refused to \naddress the student loan debt that he cosigned for because he believes it is solely his \ndaughter\u2019s responsibility. Additionally, instead of addressing his delayed tax filings \ncloser in time to when they occurred, he allowed his tax situation to cascade over the \nnext five years. While he has made some progress in bringing his tax situation current, \nhe has not shown that he is able to remain in compliance with his tax obligations. His \nactions are insufficient to overcome the ongoing security concerns. Overall, the record \nevidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability \nfor a security clearance. I conclude that Applicant did not provide sufficient evidence to \nmitigate the financial security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b-1.h: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.i and 1.j:  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \nBryan J. Olmos \nAdministrative Judge \n10 \n",

Applicant claimed that, during this time, her financial \nsituation improved. However, in 2013, Applicant resigned from this position because of \nwhat she described as an \u201cunprofessional relationship\u201d with a coworker. After about six \nmonths, Applicant was able to secure new employment, but with a significant pay cut, \nearning about $24,000 annually. From 2013 through 2020, she maintained full-time \nemployment, but at continually low salaries. (GX 2-3; FORM Response) \nIn 2016, Applicant\u2019s husband, who remained in the military at the time, deployed \nfor a year. Applicant described experiencing marital difficulties during this period and \nfacing a \u201chuge financial burden.\u201d Paying her expenses was not a priority and she \nallowed another vehicle to be repossessed (\u00b6 1.a) because she was not using it at the \ntime. (GX 2-4) \nApplicant\u2019s husband began experiencing health issues a few months after his \nreturn from the deployment. In 2019, he underwent heart surgery and received a \nmedical discharge from the military. In May 2020, Applicant and her husband moved \nfrom State A to State B to be close to his son (her stepson). At the time of their move, \nApplicant secured a new offer of employment. However, the offer was later withdrawn \nbecause of work shutdowns related to COVID-19. Applicant was able to secure new \nemployment, beginning in June 2020. Still, she described experiencing further financial \nstrain during this period following the move. (GX 2-3; AX B; FORM Response) \nSince starting with her current employer in April 2021, Applicant has received two \nsignificant pay raises. She now earns an annual salary of approximately $80,500. She \nand her husband also receive military disability payments. Applicant stated that their \ncombined earnings are just under $200,000 per year. (GX 2-3; AX D; FORM Response) \nIn December 2022, following her receipt of the SOR, Applicant contracted with a \ndebt resolution company to settle her debts. She submitted a total debt of $41,640 for \ninclusion in the company\u2019s program. This included the accounts referenced in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a, 1.m, 1.r, 1.t \u2013 1.v, and 1.x \u2013 1.z. She also included one $666 debt not alleged in the \nSOR. She was to make biweekly payments of $318 into the program over 48 months. \nThe company would then use those funds to negotiate the settlement of Applicant\u2019s \ndebts. The record is absent any evidence of payments in accordance with this program. \n(GX 2; AX A) \nAs part of the agreement with the debt resolution company, Applicant submitted \na form titled \u201cPersonal Cash Flow Assessment,\u201d reflecting that she had an available \nmonthly household income of $8,000.

Applicant detailed that she previously held a security clearance and never \nexperienced a security incident. She stated she takes her career very seriously and has \npride in her work. (GX 2; FORM Response) \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard \nindicates that security determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \n484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988) \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on \nmere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThe financial security concern is broader than the possibility that an individual \nmight knowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money. It \nencompasses concerns about an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities \nessential to protecting classified information. An individual who is financially \nirresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and \nsafeguarding classified information. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, \n2012) \nThe adjudicative guideline notes two conditions that could raise security \nconcerns under AG \u00b6 19 and are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant has a long history of financial difficulties. The delinquent debts in the \nSOR, including two charged-off vehicle loans, federal student loans, multiple credit \ncards, payday loans as well as phone and utility accounts are established by Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions and the credit report in the record. The above disqualifying conditions apply. \nThere are four conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security concerns \narising from Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nIn 2008, Applicant purchased a vehicle that she quickly realized she could not \nafford. Over the next year, she was honorably discharged from the Army, got married, \nhad a child and returned to school. A few years later, she experienced income loss \nwhen she left her employment. She also experienced marital issues following her \nhusband\u2019s deployment. More recently, her husband had heart surgery and was \nmedically discharged from the military. These events were largely beyond Applicant\u2019s \ncontrol and caused significant stress to her financial circumstances. In December 2022, \nshe hired a debt resolution company to assist her in addressing her delinquent \naccounts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and 20(d) have some application. \nHowever, Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts remained unresolved for years. Although \nshe started her current position in April 2021, there is no evidence in the record that she \ntook responsible action to address the debts prior to receiving the SOR. Even after \nentering into a debt resolution agreement, Applicant did not provide evidence that she \nmade any payments toward the plan. Meanwhile, Applicant\u2019s federal student loans were \ndelinquent before COVID-19 and are not included in her debt resolution agreement. She \nhas not established any plan to resolve these delinquent loans. Her recent promises to \npay within the debt resolution agreement do not establish responsible action under the \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncircumstances. She has not shown a track record of steady payments towards her \ndebts to establish good faith. Neither AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) or 20(d) fully apply. \nWith the assistance of the debt resolution company, Applicant formulated a \nbudget and devised a plan to resolve her delinquent accounts. However, given the \nlength of time and extent of her delinquent debts, these recent efforts are insufficient to \nestablish that her financial problems are being resolved or are under control. AG \u00b6 20 \n(c) does not fully apply. \nApplicant began experiencing financial difficulties in 2008. In the years that \nfollowed, her financial difficulties extended to include new delinquencies that occurred \nas recently as 2020. Although Applicant recently contracted with a debt resolution \ncompany, she has not established a sufficient track record of payments to conclude that \nthe accounts are being resolved responsibly. Her financial difficulties are recent and \nongoing. Applicant\u2019s financial circumstances continue to cast doubt on her current \nreliability, judgment and trustworthiness. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant served in the Army and received an honorable discharge. She \npreviously held a security clearance without incident. Beginning in 2008, she \nexperienced several events that caused significant financial stress. She also \nacknowledged that some of her decisions over time increased her financial stress. \nRecently, she has taken steps to budget and address her financial concerns. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nHowever, even after securing new employment in April 2021, Applicant did not \ntake proximate action to resolve her long-delinquent accounts. Finally, after receipt of \nthe SOR, Applicant formulated a plan to address some of her debts through a debt \nresolution company. Applicant did not include any record of payments into the plan. \nAdditionally, she did not present any plan regarding the resolution of her delinquent \nstudent loans. Her actions are insufficient to overcome the ongoing security concerns. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude that Applicant did not \nprovide sufficient evidence to mitigate the financial security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.z: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Under Guideline F, the SOR alleged that Applicant owed $80,535 for two delinquent federally guaranteed student loan accounts (SOR 1.a and 1.b); and that he owed $7,330 for two delinquent commercial credit accounts (SOR 1.c and 1.d). In response, Applicant admitted each allegation, with explanations, and he provided documents in support of his responses. (Answer) Under Guideline E, SOR 2.a alleged that Applicant intentionally made a false official statement in his March 2022 e-QIP. Specifically, it was alleged that he deliberately omitted from his e-QIP the debts alleged at SOR 1.a \u2013 1.d by answering \u201cNo\u201d to questions under Section 26 (Financial Record) that required him to disclose whether, in the preceding seven years, he had debts more than 120 days past due. Applicant admitted SOR 2.a, with explanation. However, in reviewing the pleadings at hearing, Applicant denied that he intentionally made a false statement through his e- QIP answers. Accordingly, I entered his response as a denial, thus making the question 2 of his intent to falsify a controverted question of fact. (Tr. 13 \u2013 15; see also Directive, Section E3.1.14) In addition to the facts established by Applicant\u2019s admissions, I make the following findings of relevant fact.

Based on the results of the ensuing background \ninvestigation, adjudicators for the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DCSA CAF) could not affirmatively determine that it is clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOn December 12, 2022, DCSA CAF issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) alleging facts that raise security concerns under the adjudicative guidelines for \nfinancial considerations (Guideline F) and personal conduct (Guideline E). The DOD CAF \nissued the SOR pursuant to Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960); Department of Defense (DOD) Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive) \n(January 2, 1992), as amended; and Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, \nestablishing in Appendix A the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining \nEligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position \n(AGs), effective June 8, 2017. \nApplicant timely responded to the SOR (Answer) and asked for a hearing before \nan administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). I was \nassigned this case on April 27, 2023. On June 5, 2023, I convened a hearing by video \nteleconferencing. The parties appeared as scheduled, and I received a transcript of the \nhearing (Tr.) on June 14, 2023. \nDepartment Counsel proffered Government Exhibits (GX) 1 \u2013 6, as well as a list of \nGovernment exhibits and a copy of a discovery letter dated March 17, 2023, which are \nincluded as Hearing Exhibits (HX) 1 and 2, respectively. \nApplicant testified in his own behalf, but he did not present any documentary \nevidence. I held the record open after the hearing to receive additional relevant \ninformation. Applicant timely submitted three exhibits identified as AX A - C. No objections \nto admissibility were raised by either party and all proffered exhibits were admitted. The \nrecord closed on June 13, 2023, when Department Counsel waived objections to \nApplicant\u2019s post-hearing submissions. \nFindings of Fact \nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleged that Applicant owed $80,535 for two \ndelinquent federally guaranteed student loan accounts (SOR 1.a and 1.b); and that he \nowed $7,330 for two delinquent commercial credit accounts (SOR 1.c and 1.d). In \nresponse, Applicant admitted each allegation, with explanations, and he provided \ndocuments in support of his responses. (Answer) \nUnder Guideline E, SOR 2.a alleged that Applicant intentionally made a false \nofficial statement in his March 2022 e-QIP. Specifically, it was alleged that he deliberately \nomitted from his e-QIP the debts alleged at SOR 1.a \u2013 1.d by answering \u201cNo\u201d to questions \nunder Section 26 (Financial Record) that required him to disclose whether, in the \npreceding seven years, he had debts more than 120 days past due. \nApplicant admitted SOR 2.a, with explanation. However, in reviewing the pleadings \nat hearing, Applicant denied that he intentionally made a false statement through his e-\nQIP answers.

(Tr. 13 \u2013 15; see also Directive, \nSection E3.1.14) In addition to the facts established by Applicant\u2019s admissions, I make \nthe following findings of relevant fact. \nApplicant is a 39-year-old employee of a defense contractor, for whom he has \nworked since March 2021. He previously held a security clearance while working for a \nfederal contractor between September 2008 and September 2016. He applied for that \nclearance through an e-QIP he submitted on June 3, 2010. (GX 1; GX 2) \nApplicant graduated from college in August 2008. He funded his tuition through the \nstudent loans addressed in SOR 1.a and 1.b. Thereafter, he moved to State A, where, as \nnoted above, he worked as a federal contractor. His annual salary ranged between \n$35,000 and $55,000. In his 2010 e-QIP, Applicant disclosed that he was or had been \ndelinquent on three commercial credit accounts (not alleged in the SOR), and that he was \ndelinquent or past due on his student loans, which then totaled about $51,000. The \ncommercial accounts appear to have been paid off. As to his student loans, after \nApplicant\u2019s income tax refund was diverted toward those accounts in 2009, he set up a \nrepayment plan and made monthly payments of $387. He managed to make those \npayments for about a year, and he has not made a regular payment on his student loans \nsince 2010. (GX 2; GX 6; Tr. 49 \u2013 52, 55 \u2013 56, 61 \u2013 64) \nApplicant next acted on his student loans in January 2023, when he contacted a \ncredit repair and debt negotiation company. With his Answer, he provided information that \nshows the credit repair firm has contacted his creditors. That information does not show \nthat he is making any payments on his student loans or other debts. Applicant testified \nthat he pays that firm $100 monthly for their services. On June 5, 2023, Applicant enrolled \nin a debt repayment plan that requires him to make bi-weekly payments of $135 to satisfy \nthe debts at SOR 1.c and 1.d, as well as three other debts not alleged in the SOR, totaling \n$17,081. The plan would resolve those debts in four years. (Answer; AX A; AX B; Tr. 56 \n\u2013 59) \nOn June 9, 2023, Applicant enrolled in a student loan rehabilitation program \n(\u201cFresh Start Transfer\u201d) to resolve five student loan accounts totaling $82,242. Available \ninformation reflects that he has asked for his payments to be based on his income; \nhowever, the record does not reflect a monthly payment or schedule of payments. (AX C) \nApplicant attributes his current financial problems to an extended period of \nunemployment. In 2016, he left his federal contractor employment in State A and moved \nto State B to assist his sister and her children. His sister was seriously ill and could not \nafford in-home care. After Applicant used up his savings to support himself, he opened \nthe credit card accounts alleged at SOR 1.c and 1.d. Additionally, his sister and parents \nhelped him financially from time to time. Applicant returned to the workforce in October \n2019, when he took an information technology (IT) position at a local hospital. He earned \nabout $17 hourly before taking a job with the contractor sponsoring his current request \nfor clearance in March 2021. In February 2023, Applicant was suspended without pay \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfrom his current employment pending the outcome of this adjudication. (Answer; GX 1; \nGX 2; Tr. 38 \u2013 47, 61 \u2013 64) \nApplicant did not disclose any of his delinquent debts when he submitted his e-\nQIP in March 2022. He discussed his financial problems, including his student loans, with \na government investigator in an April 2022 personal subject interview (PSI). He initially \ndenied that he had any delinquent debts until the investigator confronted him with credit \nreport information about those debts. In his hearing testimony, he acknowledged that he \nwas familiar with the information required in response to e-QIP questions by virtue of the \nfact that he had submitted a similar questionnaire in 2010. He further admitted that he \nintentionally answered \u201cNo\u201d to the e-QIP because he did not have current information \nabout his student loans and other debts. (GX 1; GX 2; GX 3; Tr. 48 \u2013 49, 61 \u2013 64, 68 \u2013 \n69) \nApplicant and his wife have been married since June 2022. They have no children \ntogether; however, Applicant has a young child from a previous relationship for whom he \npays about $425 monthly in child support. His wife earns about $70,000 annually, and his \nbrother has been covering the aforementioned child support payments since November \n2022. Additionally, Applicant\u2019s parents have been paying his half of their rent. Applicant \nand his wife do not manage their monthly finances according to a structured budget, and \nbecause Applicant\u2019s income tax refunds are diverted to his student loan accounts, they \nfile their taxes separately. Applicant is current on all of his income tax reporting and \npayment obligations. (Tr. 37, 66 \u2013 68, 74 \u2013 76) \nPolicies \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG). (See Directive, 6.3) Decisions must also reflect consideration of the \nfactors listed in \u00b6 2(d) of the guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d \nconcept, those factors are: \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. A security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest for an applicant to either receive or continue to have \naccess to classified information. (See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 \n(1988)) \nThe Government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on \nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an \napplicant. Additionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged \nin the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, \nextenuate or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security \nclearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion. (Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, \n531) A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her \nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n(Egan at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b)) \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nThe Government met its burden of producing sufficient, reliable information to \nsupport the SOR allegations that Applicant accrued significant past-due or delinquent \ndebts. This information reasonably raises a security concern about Applicant\u2019s finances \nthat is articulated at AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nMore specifically, available information requires application of the following AG \u00b6 \n19 disqualifying conditions: \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nAvailable information also requires consideration of the AG \u00b6 20 mitigating \nconditions that pertain to these facts and circumstances: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. Applicant\u2019s debts are multiple, and by virtue of the fact \nnone of them are resolved, they are recent and ongoing. \nAs to AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and 20(d), Applicant asserts his financial troubles stem from his \nextended unemployment between 2016 and 2019. Standing by itself, that circumstance \nwould require application of the first prong of this mitigating condition. However, as \ndocumented in his first e-QIP, Applicant has had financial problems since he graduated \nfrom college in 2008. He only made regular student loan payments for about a year in \n2009 and 2010 through a repayment plan he established after his income tax refund was \ndiverted in 2009. Between 2010 and 2023, he took no identifiable action to address any \nof his debts, and it was only after his hearing that he established a repayment plan for his \ncommercial debts and entered a student loan rehabilitation program for those debts. \nThese are admirable steps and should be encouraged; however, he did not timely act to \naddress any of his debts, even after discussing them with an investigator as a security \nissue in April 2022. The foregoing does not support a finding that he acted responsibly in \nthe face of any unforeseen circumstances or that he has engaged in a good-faith effort to \nrepay his debts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and 20(d) do not apply. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) applies, but only in a limited way. At a cost of $100 a month, Applicant \nengaged the services of a firm that offers to challenge entries in one\u2019s credit history. It \nmay also be that this firm provides credit and financial counseling services, but he did not \npresent any information to that effect. On balance, Applicant did not establish any track \nrecord of payment or other efforts to resolve his debts. Nor did he show how his personal \nfinances are now being managed in a way that would preclude a recurrence of the security \nconcerns identified in the Government\u2019s information. Those concerns remain unresolved. \nPersonal Conduct \nThe security concern addressed under this guideline is stated at AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or cooperate \nwith security processing, including but not limited to meeting with a security \ninvestigator for subject interview, completing security forms or releases, \ncooperation with medical or psychological evaluation, or polygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful questions of \ninvestigators, security officials, or other official representatives in \nconnection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination. \nApplicant did not disclose in his e-QIP, as required by the questions in Section 26 \n(Financial Record), the debts alleged at SOR 1.a \u2013 1.d. To be disqualifying, such an \nomission must be an intentional attempt to deceive the government about information \nrelevant and material to its interest in ensuring the suitability of persons with security \nclearances. A simple mistake or misunderstanding resulting in an incorrect answer is not \nsufficient. In response to SOR 2.a, Applicant denied having such intent. Thus, it fell to the \nGovernment to provide sufficient information to support the allegation and prove intent. \nSpecifically, at issue is whether the record supports application of the disqualifying \ncondition at AG \u00b6 16(a): \ndeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any \npersonnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nI conclude it does. Applicant\u2019s completion of an in e-QIP in 2010, in which he \nanswered \u201cyes\u201d to the same questions and provided information about the same student \nloan delinquencies at issue here, shows that he understood what information was \nrequired of him. Further, at his hearing, he testified that he knew he should have disclosed \nhis debts but deliberately answered \u201cNo\u201d because he did not have detailed information \nabout his debts. Although it was not alleged in the SOR, I also note that Applicant may \nhave tried to conceal his debts during his April 2022 PSI. Available information shows he \nhad to be confronted with the information about his debts before he acknowledged he \nowed them. All of the information in this record probative of his state of mind when he \nsubmitted his 2022 e-QIP supports application of AG \u00b6 16(a). \nI also considered the following AG \u00b6 17 mitigating conditions: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused \nor significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a person with \nprofessional responsibilities for advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning security processes. Upon being made aware of the \nrequirement to cooperate or provide the information, the individual \ncooperated fully and truthfully; and \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \nApplicant did not try to correct his omissions before being confronted with the \ninformation about his debts in his PSI. He also did not establish that he omitted his debts \npursuant to any qualified advice. Finally, this recent instance of deliberate omission \nundermines confidence that Applicant will act in the best interests of the government in \nprotecting sensitive information. Accordingly, it cannot be viewed as minor and it reflects \nadversely on Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness and judgment. All of the foregoing precludes \napplication of AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a), 16(b), and 16(c). Applicant has not mitigated the security \nconcerns about his personal conduct. \nI also have considered the potential application of the whole-person factors at \u00b6 \n2(d). The record evidence as a whole leaves unresolved the doubts about Applicant\u2019s \nsuitability for a clearance that have been raised by the Government\u2019s information. \nBecause protection of the national interest is the principal focus of these adjudications, \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                        \n \n \nthose remaining doubts must be resolved against the granting of access to classified \ninformation. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national \nsecurity for Applicant to have access to classified information.

Applicant is a 32-year-old security officer employed by a federal contractor since February 2022. He was employed as a security officer by a non-federal employer from April 2012 until June 2014, when he was fired for flashing his company-issued firearm at a driver who had been tailgating him. The tailgating driver notified the police, who arrested Applicant, confiscated his firearm, and charged him with assault with a dangerous weapon. Applicant was placed on ankle monitoring for six months, after which the charge was dismissed. He was unemployed from June 2014 to March 2016. He was employed as a security officer by several non-federal employers from March 2016 until he was hired by his current employer. He has never held a security clearance. Applicant attended university classes from June 2009 to June 2015 but did not receive a degree. He incurred the delinquent student loans alleged in the SOR during this time.

In his \nanswer to the SOR, Applicant attributed his delinquent debts to unemployment, reduced \nincome, reduced working hours due to COVID, and mental distraction due to the deaths \nof his father, mother, youngest brother, and best friend.

(FORM \nItem 3) He did not submit any information showing his income and expenses at the time \nthe student loan payments became due, nor did he submit any current financial \ninformation. \nOn March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act \n(CARES Act) became law, and it provided for relief measures on Department of \nEducation-owned federal student loans. This student-loan debt relief received several \nextensions. The CARES Act was followed by a DOE debt-relief program that was \nstalled by litigation, and the pause in student-loan payments remains in effect. (See \nwww.studentaid.gov.) \n. \nA credit report from May 2022 reflects that all of Applicant\u2019s student loans were \nassigned to the U.S. Government for collection between February 2012 and September \n2015. (FORM Item 4) Notwithstanding the pause in student loan payments Appellant\u2019s \nstudent loans were delinquent before the CARES Act and subsequent COVID payment \npause went into effect. Accordingly, there is a concern that Appellant will not make \npayments on his student loans if collection of payments is resumed. \nA recent credit report dated March 2, 2023, reflects that the credit-card account \nhas been paid in full, and payments on another car loan that is not alleged in the SOR \nare current. However, it also reflects that payments on the charged-off car loan are still \npast due in the amount alleged in the SOR, and it reflects a telecommunications bill, not \nalleged in the SOR, that became delinquent in May 2020 has been referred for \ncollection of $145. (FORM Item 6) I have considered the unalleged charge of assault \nwith a dangerous weapon and the unalleged telecommunications bill for the limited \npurpose of evaluating Applicant's evidence of extenuation and mitigation. See ISCR \nCase No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006). \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in\nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-\n01253 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016).\n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. \n01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is \nfinancially overextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or \notherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See \nISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence in the FORM establish two disqualifying \nconditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d) and AG \u00b6 19(c) \n(\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). The following mitigating conditions are \npotentially relevant: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are numerous, recent,\nand were not incurred under circumstances making recurrence unlikely.\n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not established. Applicant\u2019s unemployment from June 2014 to \nMarch 2016 was due to his misconduct.

He stated in his \nanswer to the SOR that he had made a payment agreement for the delinquent car loan, \nbut he submitted no documentation of an agreement. His single payment on the car \nloan falls short of a track record of timely payments. He submitted no evidence of \ncontacts with his other creditors or efforts to make payment plans that were affordable \nwith his reduced income. He provided no evidence of his living expenses or income \nhistory. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is not established. Applicant submitted evidence that he resolved a \ndelinquent credit-card account and made one payment on his delinquent car loan, but \nhe did not do so until he received the SOR and realized that his delinquent debts could \nprevent him from obtaining a security clearance. Evidence of past irresponsibility is not \nmitigated by payment of debts under pressure of qualifying for a security clearance. \nApplicants who begin to address their security-significant conduct only when their \npersonal interests are at stake may be lacking in judgment and reliability. ISCR Case \nNo. 16-01211 (App. Bd. May 30, 2018). \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person \nanalysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Because Applicant requested \na determination on the record without a hearing, I had no opportunity to evaluate his \ncredibility and sincerity based on demeanor. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. \nBd. Jul. 23, 2003). After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under \nGuideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by his delinquent \ndebts. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.l: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

(Item \n4) \nIn her Answer, Applicant acknowledged that she made a bad decision when she \ndecided to drink before going to work. She said this was an isolated incident, and in the \nfuture, she would not consume alcohol and drive, or go to work after consuming alcohol. \n(Item 2) \nPolicies \nThe national security eligibility action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to \nHold a Sensitive Position (AG), which became effective within the DoD on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to \nclassified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of variables \nknown as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable, and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person applying for national security eligibility seeks to enter a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination \nunder this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption \nAG \u00b6 21 describes the security concerns pertaining to alcohol consumption: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 22 lists conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case. Two may potentially apply: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder; \nand \n(b) alcohol-related incidents at work, such as reporting for work or duty in \nan intoxicated or impaired condition, drinking on the job, or jeopardizing the \nwelfare and safety of others, regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed with alcohol use disorder. \nIn July 2021, Applicant reported to work in an intoxicated state and then left work \nand drove her car. She was subsequently arrested and charged with DUI, after failing \nsobriety and blood tests. In January 2022, she pleaded guilty to the DUI. The evidence \nraised the above disqualifying conditions, thereby shifting the burden to Applicant to rebut, \nextenuate, or mitigate those concerns. \nAG \u00b6 23 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns under this \nguideline. Four may potentially apply in this case: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations; \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations. \nApplicant was arrested for DUI in July 2021, less than two years ago. Based on \nher history of regularly consuming alcohol, there is insufficient evidence to find that the \ncircumstances surrounding her DUI were unusual, so they continue to cast doubt on her \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \njudgment and reliability. Applicant admitted that she made a serious mistake when she \ndrank alcohol before going to work, but she has not provided credible evidence that she \nhas taken actions to overcome her problem. She did not submit evidence that she is \nparticipating in counseling or treatment, or is otherwise making satisfactory progress in \naddressing her drinking problems. She did not present documentation that she \nsuccessfully completed the court-ordered alcohol education classes or provide the results \nof her alcohol evaluation. There is insufficient evidence to establish any of the above \nmitigating conditions. \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 30 describes the security concerns related to criminal conduct: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 lists conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case. Two may potentially apply: \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted; and \n(c) individual is currently on parole or probation. \nIn July 2021, Applicant was arrested and charged with DUI. In January 2022, she \npleaded guilty to DUI, and was placed on probation for a year and ordered to undergo an \nalcohol evaluation and attend AA. After receiving the FORM on January 13, 2023, she \ndid not submit evidence that she had been released from probation or completed the \nother requirements of her sentence. The evidence establishes the above disqualifying \nconditions. \nAG \u00b6 32 describes conditions that could mitigate security concerns raised under \nthis guideline. Two may potentially apply: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nThere is insufficient evidence to establish mitigation under AG \u00b6 32(a) for the same \nreasons set forth above, under AG \u00b6 23(a). There is no evidence that Applicant \nsuccessfully complied with the terms of her probation and was released from it. She did \nnot provide evidence that she completed the other terms of her sentence. She did not \nsubmit evidence of a good employment record since July 2021, or other evidence of \nsuccessful rehabilitation. There is insufficient evidence to establish mitigation under AG \n\u00b6 32(d). \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 explains the security concerns relating to personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes.  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case. Two may potentially apply: \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing; \n(f) violation of a written or recorded commitment made by the individual to \nthe employer as a condition of employment. \nWhen Applicant came to work inebriated on July 22, 2022, she exhibited \nintoxicated and inappropriate conduct that created a vulnerability to duress because it \nwould predictably affect her personal and professional standing. It was also in violation of \nseveral conditions of her employment. The evidence establishes both disqualifying \nconditions. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns raised under this \nguideline.

Applicant acknowledged her \nmisconduct, but did not provide proof that she has participated in counseling, or took other \nsteps to address the underlying factors contributing to her unreliable conduct. She did not \npresent credible evidence to indicate that similar conduct will not recur in her personal life \nor in her work environment. There is insufficient evidence to establish mitigation under \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c), or 17(d). Applicant said her family and friends are aware of the situation, \nwhich may reduce her vulnerability to exploitation or duress, so AG \u00b6 17(e) minimally \napplies. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s national security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct \nand all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \na security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature adult, who \nis accountable for her decisions and actions. In July 2021, Applicant went to work \ninebriated. She then declined an offered ride, tried to drive home, and was arrested and \ncharged with DUI. In January 2022, she was convicted of DUI and placed on a year-long \nprobation with several court-ordered requirements pertinent to alcohol abuse. She \nsubmitted no evidence confirming that she successfully completed probation or alcohol \ntreatment, and now recognizes the significance of her past behavior. There is no evidence \npertinent her court-ordered alcohol evaluation. The absence of credible evidence of \nrehabilitation precludes a conclusion that she could be relied upon to comply with \nsecurity-related requirements for the protection of classified and sensitive information. \nShe did not meet her burden to mitigate the security concerns arising under the guidelines \nfor alcohol consumption, criminal conduct, and personal conduct. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline G: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nConsidering all circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility for \naccess to classified information.

(Applicant\u2019s Answer to \nSOR.) \nNot relevant to this issue, but noted by the Applicant, is the fact that as an \nAmerican living abroad he is entitled to special benefits such as the Foreign Earned \nIncome Exclusion and Foreign Tax Credit.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to \npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F -  Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. One is potentially applicable in this case: \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant failed to timely file his Federal income tax returns for tax years 2012 \nthrough 2020. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \nThe following mitigating conditions under the Financial Considerations guideline \nare potentially applicable under AG \u00b6 20; \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g. loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nDelinquent income tax returns are inconsistent with being cleared for access to \nclassified information. Applicant failed to file his Federal income tax returns as required \nby law, for at least 8 years, from 2012 to 2020. Also, there is no evidence in the record \nregarding whether he filed his 2021 income tax returns. Applicant is aware of the legal \nrequirement to file annual Federal income tax returns in a timely fashion. He stated that \nhis Federal income tax returns in question are in the process of being filed. However, \nthere is no documentary evidence in the record to show that he has taken any steps to \nensure that his tax returns are being filed, or whether they will be filed in a timely basis \ngoing forward. \nApplicant\u2019s inaction for so long reflects a pattern of unreliability, \nuntrustworthiness, and poor judgment. \nAccordingly, Applicant does not meet the \nrequirements to access classified information. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I conclude Applicant has not \nmitigated the Financial Considerations security concerns. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance.

(Items 6 and 7) He opened \nthis account with the creditor in June 2021, and by June 2022, the account was in a \ncollection status. (Item 6 at 7) In 2023, the creditor assigned the account to a debt \ncollector to continue collection efforts. The collection balance increased from $10,884 to \n$11,066, and the account remains in a collection status. (Item 7 at 8) This debt is \nunresolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.k is also an individual account that appears in two credit bureau reports. \n(Items 5 and 6) Applicant opened the account in August 2018. (Item 5 at 3) This debt was \ncharged off by the original creditor in about April 2021, and acquired in May 2021 by a \nsubstitute creditor. The substitute creditor returned the account to a collection status and \nkept the account balance the same. (Item 6 at 7) This debt is unresolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.j: Applicant admits this debt, an individual account that appears in two \ncredit bureau reports. (Items 6 and 7) He opened this account in March 2021, and by \nJune 2022, the account was in a collection status. (Items 6 at 7) The first major \ndelinquency was reported in June 2021. The creditor assigned the account to a debt \ncollector to continue collection efforts. The collection balance remained the same.

The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d EO 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d EO 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has \nnot met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro.

Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence in the FORM establish two disqualifying \nconditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d) and AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca \nhistory of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially relevant: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6  20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control;  \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \nAG \u00b6 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), and 20(c) are not established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are \nrecent and ongoing, and most of them remain unresolved. He did not provide \ndocumentary evidence to support his case, nor did he explain the circumstances that led \nto his financial problems. He presented no evidence to show his financial problems were \nincurred due to circumstances beyond his control. He did not provide information or \nevidence about his income, expenses, or other financial resources at his disposal. Nor \ndid he provide information or evidence he received or is receiving financial counseling, \nand his financial problems are not under control. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is not fully established. There is evidence Applicant took steps to \naddress his delinquent debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h and 1.i. In his response to the SOR, he \ncommented, regarding these two debts, that the amount owed on each was \u201cnot that \nmuch,\u201d without explaining or providing context to the comment. Credit bureau reports \nshow the total amount of these debts decreased over time. He gets some credit for taking \nsteps to address these two debts. However, his denial of debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j and 1.k is \nnot persuasive. He denied these debts because, as he stated, he did not recognize the \ncreditors. These debts, both individual accounts, were clearly established through credit \nbureau reports. It is well settled that adverse information in credit bureau reports is \nsufficient to establish the Government\u2019s prima facie case that Applicant had delinquent \ndebts that are of security concern. See generally ISCR Case No. 19-02993 (App. Bd. \nNov. 23, 2021). Once established, it is the Applicant\u2019s burden to mitigate the security \nconcern. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. Applicant has not met his burden here. \nAG \u00b6 20(e) is not established. Applicant failed to establish he disputed any debt \nand that he supported any such dispute with evidence of his actions to resolve it. \nOverall, there is insufficient evidence to determine that Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems will be resolved within a reasonable time. I am unable to find he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances or that he made a good-faith effort to pay his debts. \nHis financial issues continue to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and \ngood judgment. Financial considerations security concerns remain in this case. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns.  \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.g: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.h \u2013 1.i: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.j \u2013 1.l: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \nnational security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall \nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant had over $52,000 of admitted past-due debts. \nThe evidence is \nsufficient to raise these disqualifying conditions. \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 including: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAlthough Applicant can attribute his financial difficulties to the death of a partner \nand to two minor heart attacks, these occurred five to six years ago. Only recently has \nhe begun to address his significant past-due indebtedness. Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems are ongoing, as he still owes in excess of $42,000 to 15 different creditors that \nhe has yet to address. He has not demonstrated that future financial problems are \nunlikely. Mitigation under AG \u00b6 20 has not been established. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. Applicant has a \ndistinguished history of working in the defense industry. He performs well at his job. \n(AppX A.) Overall, however, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts \nas to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, \nI conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the Financial Considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a.~1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d: \nFor Applicant \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nSubparagraphs 1.e.~1.j: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.k: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.l. and 1.m: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.n: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.o:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.p: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.q. and 1.r: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.s:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.u: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

Applicant continued to work his full-time job while his business \npartner quit his job and worked full-time at the business. The business did well for several \nyears. In 2016, the business had a large commercial job that was poorly managed. To \nkeep things going, they took out loans so they could buy material and manufacture \nproducts. At one point, Applicant took out a line of credit in order to make payroll and for \nother business expenses. They completed the job, but the business took a downturn. His \nbusiness partner decided it was too much work and walked away from the business. \nApplicant tried to continue running the business, but it eventually closed.

He indicates that \nApplicant\u2019s business bid on large contract. The business underbid the job and went \nbankrupt performing the work but completed the job. The company through Applicant \nretained counsel to defend against and negotiate debts related to the business. \nApplicant\u2019s attorney says all debts alleged in the SOR are related to the failed business \nventure. Applicant has a history of being financially responsible for his personal debts. \n(Response to FORM) \nApplicant\u2019s attorney states Applicant filed both federal and state income tax returns \nfor tax year 2019. The IRS confirmed receipt of the 2019 federal tax return. Applicant \nworked for years to resolve the debts of his failed business venture. He entered an \nagreement to settle the $78,085 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a for $10,000. The amount of \nthe debt to be resolved is approximately $7,132. (Response to FORM) \nThe current status of the SOR allegations are: \nSOR \u00b6 1.a:  $78,085 debt placed for collection: Applicant states this is a business \nloan. He was a co-signer on the loan. He mentions he has learned that the lender is \nknown as a predatory lender. He and his lawyer worked for years to settle this debt. On \nApril 18, 2023, the case was settled for $10,000. Applicant paid two $2,500 payments to \nthe creditor, for a total of $5,000. Applicant agreed to pay $500 a month starting on July \n1, 2023 for a total of ten months. The final payment is due on April 1, 2024. The debt is \nbeing resolved. (AE A) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b: Delinquent bank loan, amount is unknown: Applicant states this is a \nloan for the business. He signed as co-signer. His lawyer is in discussions with the bank \nto arrange an achievable payment plan. I note this debt does not show up on Applicant\u2019s \ncredit reports.  Applicant disclosed this debt during his background investigation. \nSOR \u00b6 1.c: Delinquent line of credit from a bank, amount is unknown: Applicant \nstates this is a line of credit for the business. He signed as co-signer. His lawyer is in \ndiscussions with the bank to arrange payment plan. I note this debt does not show up on \nApplicant\u2019s credit reports. Applicant disclosed this debt during his background \ninvestigation. \nSOR \u00b6 1.d: Failure to timely file his 2019 Federal income tax return for tax year \n2019. Applicant admits he did not timely file his 2019 federal income tax return. He \ntypically files an extension because his business returns are not completed on time by his \naccountant. The business returns came back later than normal, and he did not promptly \ncomplete his personal return. Applicant and his attorney, provided proof that the 2019 \nfederal income tax return was filed. (Item 2; Item 4 at 6 \u2013 12; Response to FORM, AE B) \nApplicant first responded to DOHA Interrogatories on June 22, 2022.

In his Response to \nInterrogatories, Applicant states he attempted to get his state income tax transcripts for \n2019 online. He contacted the state department of revenue. They informed he could not \nget the transcript online. He needed to submit a formal request for the tax transcript by \nmail or fax. Applicant faxed the request. He contacted the state department of revenue \nagain before submitting his Response to Interrogatories. He claims they confirmed the \n2019 state income tax return was filed and paid. No documentation was provided from \nthe state department of revenue verifying this. (Item 2, Response to FORM; Item 4 at 17, \n20) \nApplicant provided a Personal Financial Statement on June 20, 2022. His total net \nmonthly income is $5,450. His monthly expenses and monthly payments total $4,850. He \nhas approximately $600 left over each month in discretionary income.

Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988)). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d (Egan at 527). \nThe President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 2) \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours.

Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has \nnot met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531). \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d (See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 (App. Bd. \nApr. 20, 2016). Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. (Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15). An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. (ISCR Case No. 02-31154 \nat 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)) \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002)). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. (ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nAG \u00b6 19 notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security concerns. \nThe disqualifying conditions that are relevant to Applicant\u2019s case include: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nAG \u00b6 19(a) and AG \u00b6 19(c) apply to Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts alleged in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b and 1.c. AG \u00b6 19(f) applies to Applicant\u2019s failure to timely file and pay his \nfederal and state taxes for tax year 2019 as alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e. \nAG \u00b6 20 describes conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable in this case: \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) applies to the debts Applicant co-signed in order to keep his failing \nbusiness running. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a -1.c) The business downturn was a circumstance beyond \nhis control. Applicant hired an attorney to help him with resolving the debts of the \nbusiness. He was able to enter into a settlement agreement for the largest debt and \nintends to resolve the two remaining business debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) applies to the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. Applicant and his attorney \nsuccessfully negotiated a settlement agreement regarding the largest debt on April 18, \n2023. Applicant made two $2,500 payments on April 15, 2023, and June 1, 2023. He is \nto make $500 monthly payments starting on July 1, 2023 for a period of ten months.

His budget \nand assets indicate he is capable of paying this settlement agreement. \nAG \u00b6 20(g) applies with regard to Applicant\u2019s 2019 federal and state income tax \nreturns. He provided proof that he filed his 2019 federal income tax return. He is receiving \na refund for that year. Although no documentary proof was provided, Applicant and his \nlawyer claim he filed his 2019 state income tax return. I conclude Applicant more than \nlikely filed his state income tax return for tax year 2019. \nApplicant bears the burden of production and persuasion in mitigation. He \ndemonstrated that with the help of his lawyer, he is attempting to resolve the debts related \nto his failed business. Applicant overlooked filing his federal and state income tax returns \nfor 2019 because his business returns were not completed in time by his accountant. The \nbusiness returns were provided to him later than normal and he did not promptly complete \nhis 2019 income tax returns. In a letter dated June 14, 2022, the IRS acknowledged he \nfiled his federal income tax return for 2019. It is likely he filed his state tax return for 2019 \nas well. Applicant states he is current on all of his other state and federal tax returns. Tax \nyear 2019 was an oversight on his part. He is financially capable of resolving the \nremaining debts. Applicant mitigated the concerns raised under Financial Considerations. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nadjudicative guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole \nperson. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors \nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis, \nand I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person, I conclude that Applicant has mitigated the security concerns raised \nunder financial considerations. Accordingly, Applicant has carried his burden of showing \nthat it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant him eligibility for \naccess to classified information. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.e: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant \nApplicant eligibility for access to classified information.

(GE 5 at 8-9; May 2023 response to FORM at 2-3) \nThe five accounts are resolved in Applicant\u2019s favor.  \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines, which \nare flexible rules of law, apply together with common sense and the general factors of the \nwhole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14., the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15., the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . ..\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security decision.  \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18. Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect sensitive information. Financial distress can also be caused or \nexacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other trust issues \nof personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental health \nconditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \n4 \n\n    \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nA security clearance holder occupies a fiduciary relationship with the Government \nthat requires compliance with all security regulations at all times and in all locations. An \nimportant way to ascertain whether an applicant possesses the requisite judgment to \nsafeguard classified information is to examine how she manages her personal matters. \nFor example, if the applicant shows irresponsibility with her financial obligations, then \nthere is a probability she may adopt the same kind of irresponsible attitude toward security \nrules and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 19. The disqualifying conditions relevant in this case are: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \nApplicant has ten delinquent commercial accounts totaling $21,125. Her May \n2022 e-QIP, her June 2022 PSI, the Government May 2022 CBR (Item 5), and her \nDecember 2022 answer to the SOR, establish the Government\u2019s case under the financial \nconsiderations guideline. It is well settled that negative information within credit bureau \nreports can establish allegations of debt delinquencies. See ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at \n7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010) The accounts became delinquent between December 2019 and \nMay 2022. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply. Based on Applicant\u2019s documented resolution of \nten alleged and unalleged delinquent debts in the past nine months, I conclude that AG \n\u00b6 19(b) does not apply to the circumstances of this case. \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion by producing evidence that \nrebuts or mitigates the Government\u2019s case and meets her burden of demonstrating she \nwarrants eligibility for security clearance. \nAG \u00b6 20. Conditions that could mitigate trustworthiness concerns include: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n5 \n\n    \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identify theft, and the \nindividual has acted responsibly under the circumstances.  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a nonprofit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAll of the mitigating conditions identified above apply to mitigate the security \nconcerns in this case. In her professional career, she encountered a significant period of \nunemployment between 2014 and 2017. Before the SOR was issued in November 2022, \nApplicant informed OPM in June 2022 of her plan to satisfy all her delinquent accounts \nby addressing the smaller bills first, then moving to the larger ones. In her December 2022 \nanswer to the SOR, she provided documentation of paying off five unalleged creditors. In \nMay 2023, she provided additional evidence of satisfying five listed medical accounts. \nThough she has provided no evidence of counseling, there are clear indications she is \nmaking a good-faith effort to repay the past-due debts. \nWhole-Person Concept \nI have examined the evidence under the guideline for financial considerations in \nthe context of the nine general factors of the whole-person concept listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.   \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common-sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n6 \n\n    \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n   \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n__________ \nI have carefully evaluated the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the \ncontext of the entire record. Applicant is 34 years old and is raising two young children. In \n2012, she received a certificate and collected some college credits. She had pregnancy-\nrelated problems in 2012 followed by unemployment for a three-year period between 2014 \nand 2017. \nHowever, she has produced documentary proof of eliminating ten delinquent \ndebts in a nine-month period between June 2022 and May 2023. In Guideline F cases, \nthe DOHA Appeal Board has repeatedly held that, to establish her case in mitigation, an \napplicant must present a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d of debt repayments that result in debt \nreduction. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-01920 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 1, 2007) While an \napplicant is not required to show that every debt listed in the SOR is paid, the applicant \nmust show that she has a plan aimed at debt resolution and has taken significant action \nto implement the plan. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-25499 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 5, 2006) \nFrom the record presented, Applicant has demonstrated that she has a plan in place and \nhas furnished documented evidence of paying off debts pursuant to that plan. After a full \nreview of the entire record from an overall common-sense point of view, Applicant has \nmitigated the security concerns stemming from the guideline for financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.j: \n \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the security interests of the United States to grant Applicant access to \nclassified information.

Applicant provided an undated response to the SOR (Answer). He \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on \nJune 20, 2023. \nThe hearing was convened as scheduled on September 20, 2023. At the hearing, \nI admitted Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5 and Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through \nC without objection. Applicant also testified at the hearing. I left the record open after \nthe hearing to provide Applicant an opportunity to provide post-hearing documents, and \nhe timely provided AE D, which I admitted without objection. I received a transcript (Tr.) \nof the hearing on September 27, 2023. \n1 \n\nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 43-year-old employee of a government contractor for whom he has \nworked, on and off, since December 2018. He was married from July 2007 until \nSeptember 2016. He currently has a girlfriend with whom he cohabitates. He has one \n15-year-old child with whom he shares custody with his ex-wife. His girlfriend\u2019s two \nchildren also reside with him. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2015. He served on \nactive duty with the Navy from 1999 until 2007, when he earned an honorable \ndischarge. (Tr. 22-23, 28-37, 43-44, 63-64; GE 1, 4) \nIn the SOR, the Government alleged Applicant\u2019s 18 delinquent federal student \nloans and one delinquent tuition account totaling approximately $71,000 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \nthrough 1.s). He denied all the SOR allegations. Despite his denials, the SOR \nallegations are established by the Government\u2019s 2021 and 2022 credit reports. (SOR; \nAnswer, GE 2, 3, AE D) \nNone of the SOR debts were being resolved prior to the hearing. Applicant and \nhis ex-wife opened these federal student loan and tuition accounts with the Department \nof Education (DOE) and the online college beginning in about 2011, to finance their \nhigher education expenses. Applicant claimed that his ex-wife took care of the family \nfinances, while he worked. He recalls signing a packet of documents that was an \napplication for student loans, but he did not look at the packet closely and cannot recall \nthe specifics, such as loan amounts. He claimed that his ex-wife led him to believe that \nshe was only borrowing money to pay for Christmas presents and to upgrade his \ngaming personal computer. However, he acknowledged that when he signed the loan \npacket, he knew he was applying for a student loan and may have authorized the full \nstudent loan and tuition balance alleged in the SOR. (Tr. 22-27, 38- 44, 58-59; GE 1-4; \nAE A, C, D) \nAppellant suspects that his ex-wife opened additional federal student loans in his \nname without his knowledge and consent. However, he provided no corroborating \nevidence to this effect. He provided printouts of a selection of text messages between \nhim and his wife over several years, but those text messages are inconclusive as to \nwhether she did so. In those text messages, he blames her for taking out the loans and \ntuition and she disagrees and claims they both applied for them. He also acknowledged \nthat the loan package he signed may have been for the full loan and tuition amount \nbecause he did not read the documents. He claimed that he and his wife both had G.I. \nBill benefits and therefore did not need to apply for student loans. However, he did not \nexplain why he agreed to apply for federal student loans that he allegedly did not need. \n(Tr. 22-27, 38-44, 58-59; GE 1-4; AE A, C, D) \nApplicant claimed that he first became aware of the full extent of his student loan \nand tuition indebtedness in about July 2015, when he happened to look at his account \ninformation online. Based upon his ex-wife\u2019s representation to him, he believed for \nsome time that she could get all the indebtedness forgiven if she received a higher \ndisability rating from Veterans Affairs (VA). He claimed that from the time repayment \nwas required until about 2016, his ex-wife deferred the federal student loans with the \n2 \n\n \n \nservice provider. She stopped these deferral requests in about 2016 when they \ndivorced. Applicant claimed they divorced because he caught her cheating on him. (Tr. \n22-25, 42-49; GE 1, 4; AE A, C, D) \nAfter Applicant and his ex-wife divorced in 2016, the deferments on the federal \nstudent loans ended, and all the SOR debts became delinquent. He began receiving \nnotices that he was late with his payments on his federal student loans. Other than \narguing with his ex-wife as to who was responsible for repayment, he took no action to \naddress the SOR debts until about February 2020. He did not attempt to negotiate her \nresponsibility for the debts as part of the divorce proceeding. He did not dispute the \ndebts with the DOE or its loan service provider. He did not dispute the debt with the \ncredit reporting agencies. He did not bring criminal charges against his ex-wife, and he \ndid not bring a civil suit against her. (Tr. 22-25, 44-58; GE 1, 4; AE C, D) \nIn about February 2020, he contacted the loan service provider for the federal \nstudent loans and arranged to automatically pay $5 per month. He made no more than \ntwo monthly payments pursuant to this agreement before, at the end of March 2020, \nPresident Biden ordered that all federal student loans were placed in a deferment status \nduring the COVID-19 pandemic, and those payments stopped. He provided no evidence \nto show that any of the SOR debts were not delinquent prior to being placed in a \ndeferment status. The Government\u2019s 2021 and 2022 credit reports show that the SOR \ndebts were in collections. Therefore, I find that Applicant\u2019s federal student loans were \ndelinquent before the COVID-19 deferment began. (Tr. 24-25, 50-58; GE 1, 4; AE B, D) \nThe COVID-19 deferment on federal student loans has ended. As Applicant\u2019s \nfederal student loans were deferred because of COVID-19, he stopped making his $5 \nmonthly payment after March 2020. He did not make any payments from then until after \nthe hearing. He does not know how much his monthly payment on his loans will be. As \nof the hearing, he had not contacted the DOE or the loan service provider to determine \nthis information. He is unsure whether he will have the available funds to pay his \nminimum monthly payment when it becomes due as he does not follow a written \nbudget. After the hearing, he made a $110 payment towards some portion of the \nstudent loans listed in the SOR. He provided no evidence that he has attempted to \nresolve the online college tuition account. He claimed that he has about $1,600 in a \nchecking account and $6,400 invested in cryptocurrency. (Tr. 24-25, 50-68, 70-71; AE \nB, D) \nWhile the federal student loans are listed as \u201cpays as agreed\u201d in one portion of \nthe Government\u2019s 2023 credit report, there is no evidence that this status is a result of \nApplicant\u2019s resolution efforts. He testified that he does not know why the credit report \nreflects that change. Moreover, the student loans are also listed as \u201cat least 120 days or \nmore than four payments past due\u201d elsewhere in that credit report. There is also no \nevidence of a favorable resolution of the tuition account. While they are not alleged in \nthe SOR, the Government\u2019s 2023 credit report reflects that he is also no more than two \npayments behind on a mortgage and an auto loan. The same credit report reflects that \nhe took out a loan for $6,000 in 2022 to go on vacation. (Tr. 56-57, 62-63; GE 5; AE B) \n3 \n\n \n \n \nThere were several reasons that Applicant was unable to pay the SOR debts. \nInitially, the cause was that he failed to keep track of his own finances and let his ex-\nwife take care of his financial obligations. While she may have made it difficult for him to \ndetermine how much money he had borrowed, he was still responsible for reading the \nloan documents he signed and for monitoring his financial accounts. He ultimately \nlearned of the total amount of his federal student loans and tuition by simply logging on \nto his online account. There is no evidence in the record to indicate that he was unable \nto make that determination any time between 2011 and 2015. (Tr. 22-25, 28-35, 37-49; \nGE 1, 4; AE A) \nOnce Applicant did his due diligence and became aware of the SOR debts in \n2015, his failure to address these accounts was caused partly by his own inaction and \npartly by a divorce, unemployment, and underemployment. He was unemployed from \nsometime in 2017 until December 2018, then worked part time for his current employer \nuntil December 2019. Beginning in December 2019, he worked full time with his current \nemployer and then another employer until the spring of 2023. Since the spring of 2023 \nhe has been back with the same employer for whom he worked beginning in December \n2018 but is only working part time. He has also worked part time as an insurance \nsalesman and a photographer. (Tr. 22-25, 28-35, 42-49, 65-70; GE 1, 4; AE D) \nApplicant submitted numerous character letters from family, friends, and co-\nworkers, some of whom were members of law enforcement or the military. All reference \nhis integrity, honesty, reliability, and strong work ethic. They also write that he is an \nexcellent father to his son and a positive role model in the community. Some note his \ndifficult relationship with his ex-wife and blame her for his financial issues. (AE A) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant\u2019s federal student loans totaling about $71,000 were in default beginning \nin 2016 until the March 2020 COVID-19 deferment. A security clearance represents an \nobligation to the Federal Government for the protection of national secrets. Accordingly, \nfailure to honor other obligations to the Government has a direct bearing on an \napplicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. ISCR \nCase No. 14-03358 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2015). While his student loans were no longer \nconsidered delinquent in March 2020 because of the COVID-19 deferment, that action \ndoes not excuse previously delinquent student loans such as these. See ISCR Case \nNo. 20-01527 at 2 (App. Bd. June 7, 2021). He also had a delinquent tuition account. \nThe above listed conditions are made applicable by these debts, thereby shifting the \nburden to Applicant to provide evidence in mitigation. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nBeginning in March 2020, Applicant\u2019s student loans were in a deferment status \nbecause of the pandemic. However, he defaulted on these loans in 2016 prior to this \ndeferment. When student loans are automatically placed in a deferment status after \nthey are in default, Applicant\u2019s past inactions are not excused in the context of security \nclearance eligibility. He did not take any action to prepare to pay his student loans when \nthe deferment period ends in October until after the hearing and acknowledged that he \nmay not have the requisite funds to make his payments. He has not provided any \nevidence of resolution efforts with respect to his tuition account. He is also behind on \n6 \n\ntwo other financial accounts not listed in the SOR. His financial issues are ongoing, and \nhe has not established a track record of financial responsibility. He has not provided \nsufficient evidence that the behavior that led to his financial issues is unlikely to recur. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \nApplicant\u2019s delinquency on his federal student loans and college tuition was \ncaused by conditions both within his control and beyond his control. The existence and \ncreation of the student loan and tuition accounts was within his control because he \nsigned a student loan application without reading it and did not keep track of his own \nfinances. To the extent that these delinquencies were caused by his divorce, \nunemployment, and underemployment, for AG \u00b6 20(b) to be applicable, he must also \nprovide sufficient evidence that he acted responsibly under the circumstances. He has \nnot done so. He did not attempt to contact the DOE or the loan service provider \nbetween 2016 and February 2020. \nApplicant also did not contact either the DOE or the loan service provider to \narrange to make his payments despite the imminent end of the COVID-19 deferment \nperiod until after the hearing. There is no evidence that he ever contacted the creditor \nfor the tuition account. Despite believing that his ex-wife may have opened these \naccounts without his consent (the evidence is equivocal on this issue), he did not \ndispute the account with the creditor or the credit reporting agencies. He also has not \ntaken any legal action against his ex-wife and did not attempt to have the loans \nassigned to her during his divorce proceeding. Finally, he further indebted himself in \n2022 by taking out a $6,000 loan to go on vacation. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. \nApplicant\u2019s 2020 attempt to address his federal student loans with a rehabilitation \nagreement and two $5 per month payments prior to the COVID-19 deferral is of some \nmitigative value under AG \u00b6 20(d). However, he did nothing to attempt to resolve these \nstudent loans prior to then and did nothing else until after the hearing. He has also not \nprovided any evidence of his attempt to resolve the college tuition debt. AG \u00b6 20(d) \nminimally applies. \nApplicant claimed that he does not believe he owes some of the SOR debts \nbecause he assumes his ex-wife opened those accounts without his consent. If true, \nthis lack of consent could be a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of these \naccounts. However, the underlying evidence of this alleged fraud is equivocal, and he \ndoes not meet his burden of persuasion to prove it. He acknowledged that he signed \nloan documents that could have constituted his authorization to open those accounts. \nHe also acknowledged that he did not read what he signed and that he did not keep \ntrack of his finances because he allowed his ex-wife to do so. \nMoreover, for AG \u00b6 20(e) to apply, Applicant must either provide documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provide evidence of actions to resolve \nthe issue. The text messages he provided did not do so because they show that he \nclaimed his ex-wife opened the student loan accounts without his consent, but she \ndenied this and claimed they both authorized the loans. Other than arguing with his ex-\nwife to no avail, he has not provided evidence of actions to resolve the issue. He did not \n7 \n\n \n \n \ndispute the account with the creditor or the credit reporting agencies. He did not provide \nevidence that he contacted the police, filed a civil suit, or raised the issue as part of his \ndivorce proceeding. Finally, while the SOR accounts no longer show being delinquent in \none portion of the Government\u2019s 2023 credit report, there is no evidence that this \nchange reflects a positive resolution of those accounts. On the contrary, he did not \nknow why they are listed as no longer being in collections. AG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply. \nHe has not provided sufficient mitigating evidence. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I have also considered \nApplicant\u2019s honorable military service and his positive character evidence. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.s: \nAgainst Applicant \n8 \n\n________________________ \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nBenjamin R. Dorsey \nAdministrative Judge \n9 \n",

On \nOctober 31, 2022, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency Consolidated \nAdjudication Service (DCSA CAS) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging \nsecurity concerns under Guideline H.1 The CAS acted under Executive Order (Exec. \nOr.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative \n1  The letterhead for the Statement of Reasons incorrectly reflects that it was sent by the Department of \nDefense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD CAF).

ISCR Case No. 12-10810 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 12, 2016). \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.a (using \nmarijuana with varying frequency from about November 2016 to about May 2022). He \nalso admitted the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.b (intending to continue to use marijuana in the \nfuture), but with an explanation. His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. \nexplanation: \nApplicant is a 24-year-old test engineer employed by a defense contractor since \nMarch 2022. At the time he submitted his SCA, he was unmarried and lived with his \nparents. He graduated from college with a bachelor\u2019s degree in December 2021 and \nworked in various non-federal jobs until he was hired for his current position. \nWhen Applicant submitted his SCA, he answered \u201cYes\u201d to the question whether \nhe had illegally used any drugs or controlled substances within the last seven years. He \nestimated that he used marijuana from November 2016 through May 2022. He stated \nthat his use was \u201crecreational not too often from time to time.\u201d He stated that he \nintended to use marijuana in the future, explaining, \u201cI have friends who will be living in \nstates where the drug is legal for recreational use and will possibly use it while visiting.\u201d \n(FORM Item 3 at 35-36) \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDuring a PSI on August 2, 2022, Applicant told an investigator that he uses \nmarijuana about once a month with his brother or with friends. He told the investigator \nthat he does not illegally purchase marijuana but that he obtains it from dispensaries in \nadjoining states where it is legal. He also told the investigator that he has not had any \ndrug counseling or treatment. (FORM Item 4 at 4) \nWhen Applicant responded to the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.b, he admitted the \nallegation with the following explanation: \nI admit to 1.b of claiming to continue use of marijuana in the future during \ninitial interviews for security clearance. I would like to add that as of now I \ndo intend to stop the use of marijuana consumption. After speaking with \nsomeone more knowledgeable of the process for [obtaining a] security \nclearance I am aware that use of marijuana will affect me being granted a \nsecurity clearance. Not being granted clearance will affect my livelihood \nand the use of marijuana is not worth the overall problems it may cause in \nmy life.   \nIn the FORM, Department Counsel argued, \u201cIn his SOR Response, Applicant \nadmits his marijuana use and states that he intends to stop using marijuana. It does not \nappear as though Applicant has in fact ceased marijuana use, which is not compatible \nwith holding a clearance.\u201d Applicant responded to Department Counsel\u2019s argument as \nfollows: \nThis letter is to make a correction to the argument that I have not stopped \nuse of marijuana. My early statement of intention to stop was to never use \nmarijuana again. I have not had any association with marijuana since \nOctober 2022 and will not have any association again. If needed I can \ntake and provide a drug screening to show proof that I have ceased use. \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in\nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-\n01253 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016).   \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. \n01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence in the FORM establish the following \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 25(a): any substance misuse (see above definition); \nAG \u00b6 25(c): illegal possession of a controlled substance, including \ncultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or \npossession of drug paraphernalia; and \nAG \u00b6 25(g): expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, or failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such \nmisuse. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 26(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \nAG \u00b6 26(b): the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nAG \u00b6 26(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana was recent, frequent, \nand did not happen under circumstances making recurrence unlikely. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 26(b) is not fully established. Applicant acknowledged his drug involvement \nin his SCA, and he stated that he last used marijuana in May 2022, shortly after he was \nhired by for his current employer and before he submitted his SCA. In his response to \nthe FORM, he stated that his last association with marijuana was in October 2022, after \nhe submitted his SCA. He has not claimed that he has disassociated from drug-using \nassociates, including his brother. He has not changed or avoided the environment \nwhere he used drugs. Although he declared in his answer to the SOR and response to \nthe FORM that he will not use marijuana again, he has not provided the signed \nstatement of intent described in AG \u00b6 26(b(3). \nApplicant did not disavow his answers to drug-related questions in the SCA until \nhe received the SOR and realized that his marijuana use was an impediment to \nobtaining a clearance. It is not clear from the limited record whether he sincerely \ndecided that obtaining a clearance was more important to him than his recreational use \nof marijuana, or whether he simply readjusted his statement of intent in an attempt to \novercome the impact of his admission in the SCA. Because he requested a \ndetermination on the record without a hearing, I had no opportunity to evaluate his \ncredibility and sincerity based on demeanor. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. \nBd. Jul. 23, 2003). \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline H in my whole-person \nanalysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but \nsome warrant additional comment. \nThe inconsistency between Applicant\u2019s answers in the SCA and his responses to \nthe SOR and the FORM raises doubt about his true intent. Once a concern arises \nregarding an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information, there is a strong \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \npresumption against granting eligibility.

Department Counsel was prepared \nto proceed on March 22, 2023. The case was assigned to me on April 4, 2023. The \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Notice of Hearing on April 5, \n2023. I convened the hearing as scheduled on May 11, 2023. The Government offered \nGovernment Exhibits 1 and 2, which were admitted without objection.

Applicant \nrequested that the record remain open for submission of additional documentation. She \nsubmitted Applicant Exhibit B in a timely fashion, and it is admitted without objection. The \nrecord closed on June 16, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 37-year-old aircraft painter with a defense contractor (Company A). \nShe has worked for Company A since March 2022. She is single and has a bachelor of \nfine arts degree. This is her first application for a security clearance and the first time she \nhas worked for a defense contractor.

Applicant used hallucinogenic mushrooms on an infrequent basis while hiking \nwith friends between 2020 and August 2021, before she began working for Company A. \nShe no longer uses mushrooms on hikes and does not intend to use them in the future. \n(Tr. 28-30.) \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n1.d. Applicant states that she is a rule follower, understands the proscription \nagainst marijuana and mushroom use while holding a security clearance, and has evinced \na credible intent not to use any illegal drugs in the future. She submitted a signed \nstatement of intent stating that the future use of illegal drugs is grounds for revocation of \nher security clearance. (Applicant Exhibit A; Tr. 26-28.) \nMitigation \nApplicant is a successful performer as shown in her initial year-end review. Her \nsupervisor states, \u201c[Applicant] has good values and a high work ethic, and she \nunderstands and adheres to company standards, conduct policies and procedures. \n[Applicant] demonstrates a great can-do attitude and drive to be a key player and bring \nmore value to the . . . team.\u201d (Applicant Exhibit B.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 (Guideline H \u2013 Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse) \nThe security concern relating to Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse is set \nforth in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted \nin this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nI have examined the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 25 and especially \nconsidered the following: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution, or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant used marijuana in edible form from 2010 until June 2022. She purchased \nmarijuana from state-approved stores from 2020 through 2022. She also used \nhallucinogenic mushrooms about five times from 2020 through 2021. Both of the stated \ndisqualifying conditions apply. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26 have also been considered: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug-involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nIn my analysis, I have taken administrative notice of the Security Executive Agent \n(SecEA) \u201cClarifying Guidance Concerning Marijuana for Individuals Eligible to Access \nClassified Information or Eligible to Hold a Sensitive Position,\u201d dated December 21, 2021. \n(Guidance.) In her Guidance, the SecEA noted the increased number of states that have \nlegalized or decriminalized the use of marijuana (including State One) and sought to \n\u201cprovide clarifying guidance.\u201d She reaffirmed SecEA\u2019s 2014 memorandum regarding the \nimportance of compliance with Federal law on the illegality of the use of marijuana by \nholders of security clearances. She provided further clarification of Federal marijuana \npolicy, writing that this policy remains relevant to security clearance adjudications \u201cbut [is] \nnot determinative.\u201d She noted that the adjudicative guidelines provided various \nopportunities for a clearance applicant to mitigate security concerns raised by his or her \npast use of marijuana. \nApplicant used marijuana in edible form over several years as a sleep aid and to \ncontrol anxiety. She only purchased and used it in State One, where such purchase and \nuse are legal under state law. She used hallucinogenic mushrooms about five times.

Paragraph 1 is found for \nApplicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has mitigated her drug \nuse. Her forthright disclosures on her e-QIP, during an interview with an OPM \ninvestigator, in DOHA interrogatories, and at her hearing minimized or eliminated the \npotential for pressure, coercion, or duress, and demonstrated her trustworthiness. \nContinuation or recurrence of substance misuse is unlikely. Overall, the record evidence \ndoes not create any doubt as to Applicant\u2019s present suitability for national security \neligibility and a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.d: \nFor Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national security \neligibility for a security clearance.

Applicant is a 55-year-old electrician employed by a defense contractor since January 2004. He has held a security clearance since 2004. (FORM Item 6 at 8) He married in April 1998. He has two children, ages 22 and 18. The SOR alleges two delinquent debts: SOR \u00b6 1.a: Home-equity line of credit charged off for $23,390, amended to allege $16,925. This loan is reflected in credit reports from March 2022 and January 2023 (FORM Items 4 and 5). The SOR was amended to allege the lower amount reflected in the January 2023 credit report. (FORM Item 5 at 3) The January 2023 credit report reflects that the last payment on this debt was in July 2019. (FORM Item 4 at 3) The debt is not resolved. Applicant provided no evidence of the circumstances under which this debt was incurred and became delinquent, and no evidence of payments, a payment agreement, or other ongoing plans to resolve it.

On \nJanuary 12, 2023, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency Consolidated \nAdjudication Services (CAS) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security \nconcerns under Guideline F.

The unalleged credit-card \ndebts had been charged off and then settled for less than the full amount.

(FORM Item 6 at 3-8) I have \nconsidered the unalleged debts for the limited purpose of evaluating Applicant\u2019s \nevidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; to consider whether he \nhas demonstrated successful rehabilitation; to decide whether a particular provision of \nthe Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; and as part of my whole-person analysis.\nISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006).\n \n \nWhen Applicant was questioned about his income and expenses, he reported \nthat his monthly take-home pay is $4,184, and his spouse\u2019s net income is $2,126. They \nalso have income of $1,800 from a rental property. He estimated that their total monthly \nexpenses were about $5,154. (FORM Item 6 at 15-16) If his numbers are accurate, he \nwould have a net monthly remainder of about $3,000. \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-\n01253 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. \n01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is \nfinancially overextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or \notherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See \nISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence in the FORM establish two disqualifying \nconditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d) and AG \u00b6 19(c) \n(\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). The following mitigating conditions are \nrelevant: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \nAG \u00b6 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nNone of the mitigating conditions fully established. The SOR alleges only two \ndebts, but they are recent, and Applicant has submitted no evidence of unusual \ncircumstances or conditions largely beyond his control. He has not disputed the debts. \nHe submitted no evidence of financial counseling. He submitted no evidence of \npayments, payment agreements, or other actions to resolve the two debts alleged in the \nSOR. The fact that the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b is not reflected in the January 2023 \ncredit report does not establish any meaningful, independent evidence as to the \ndisposition of the debt. See ISCR Case No. 18-01250 at 2 (App. Bd. Feb. 13, 2019). \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person \nanalysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). I have considered that \nApplicant has worked for defense contractors and held a security clearance for many \nyears. Because he requested a determination on the record without a hearing, I had no \nopportunity to evaluate his credibility and sincerity based on demeanor. See ISCR Case \nNo. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jul. 23, 2003). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline F and evaluating all the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised \nby his delinquent debts. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

On his September 2020 e-QIP, Applicant answered \u201cNo\u201d to \u201cSection 26 \u2013 \nDelinquency Involving Routine Accounts . . . In the last seven (7) years, have you had \nany accounts or credit card suspended, charged off . . .\u201d (GX 1 at pages 36~37.) \nApplicant testified credibly that he thought the three past-due debts, noted above, were \nbusiness debts and not his personal debts. As such, Applicant answered \u201cNo\u201d to the \nposited question. (TR at page 50 lines 6~9.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative \njudge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \nnational security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall \nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has about $44,962 in charged-off past-due debts, that he \nacknowledged at his hearing as his personal debts. The evidence is sufficient to raise \nthese disqualifying conditions. \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 including: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances. \nAlthough Applicant can attribute his financial difficulties to the loss of his \nbusiness, his financial problems are ongoing. He has done nothing to address his \ndelinquencies. He has not demonstrated that future financial problems are unlikely. \nMitigation under AG \u00b6 20 has not been established. Financial Considerations is found \nagainst Applicant. \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result \nin an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security \nclearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national security \neligibility: \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo \nor cooperate with security processing, including but not \nlimited to meeting with a security investigator for subject \ninterview, completing security forms or releases, cooperation \nwith medical or psychological evaluation, or polygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to \nlawful questions of investigators, security officials, or other \nofficial representatives in connection with a personnel \nsecurity or trustworthiness determination. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 16. One is potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn September of 2020, Applicant mistakenly thought that his past-due business \ndebts were not his individual responsibility. As his mistaken characterization of his debts \nwas not deliberate, I find the evidence does not raise this disqualifying conditions. \nPersonal Conduct is found for Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines F and E in my whole-person analysis. Overall, the record evidence leaves \nme with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the Financial \nConsiderations security concern. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline E: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a.~2.c: \nAgainst Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nRichard A. Cefola \nAdministrative Judge \n7 \n",

She earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2012 and a master\u2019s degree in 2020. She married in March 2023. She has no children. She began her employment with a federal contractor in March 2021. She estimated her annual salary is currently about $43,000 and her husband is paid approximately $20.00 an hour, so it was difficult to estimate his earnings as the hours fluctuate. (Tr. 19-22) Applicant stated that after graduating from college she worked for an insurance company from November 2013 to approximately December 2017. She obtained student loans to pay for her undergraduate degree. Her starting annual salary was about $30,000 and increased to approximately $38,000 to $40,000. She was promoted in 2017 and moved from State A to State B. She started working on her master\u2019s degree in 2013. She 2 took classes consistently from 2013 to 2015 and then took a break from school from 2016 to 2020, when she did not attend school. She stated that her student loans were deferred while she was working on her advanced degree.

The record was held open to \nallow Applicant an opportunity to provide additional evidence. There was no objection to \nthe motion, and it was granted. The SOR amendments are included in Hearing Exhibit II. \n(Tr. 68-71) \nThe SOR was amended as follows: \n1.t. You failed to timely file, as required, Federal tax returns for at least tax years 2017, \n2018, and 2019. As of the date of this Statement of Reasons, the tax returns remain \nunfiled.

She admitted SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.q through 1.s. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and \nexhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 37 years old. She earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2012 and a master\u2019s \ndegree in 2020. She married in March 2023. She has no children. She began her \nemployment with a federal contractor in March 2021. She estimated her annual salary is \ncurrently about $43,000 and her husband is paid approximately $20.00 an hour, so it was \ndifficult to estimate his earnings as the hours fluctuate. (Tr. 19-22) \nApplicant stated that after graduating from college she worked for an insurance \ncompany from November 2013 to approximately December 2017. She obtained student \nloans to pay for her undergraduate degree. Her starting annual salary was about $30,000 \nand increased to approximately $38,000 to $40,000. She was promoted in 2017 and \nmoved from State A to State B. She started working on her master\u2019s degree in 2013.

She stated that her student loans were deferred \nwhile she was working on her advanced degree. (Tr. 22, 24, 33-35; GE 1) \nOn her April 2021 security clearance application (SCA) she disclosed she took \nmany short trips to Mexico in 2015 and traveled internationally from 2015 to March 2018 \nto France (some expenses were coved by a friend), United Kingdom, Iceland, \nGuadeloupe, and the Bahamas. (Tr. 22, 24, 33-35; GE 1) \nIn 2017, Applicant accepted a job to work in China. While waiting for her visa to be \napproved, she was unemployed from December 2017 to April 2018. During this time, she \ntraveled to Guadalupe and paid her own expenses. She testified that before she moved, \nshe closed and resolved all her financial accounts. She said that she was aware of her \nstudent loans and other debts before she left for China. She said she was going to save \nher money while in China and start paying them when she returned to the United States. \nShe did not give anyone in the United States access to her accounts while she was out \nof the country. She returned her car to the creditor and allowed it to be voluntarily \nrepossessed. (SOR \u00b6 1.k) She had to borrow money from her mother and her roommate \nwhen she arrived in China so she could secure a place to live. She repaid them both. \nWhile living in China, Applicant traveled back to the United States a few times. She also \ntraveled for pleasure to Vietnam (October 2018), Malaysia (January 2019), Indonesia \n(February 2019) Sri Lanka (June 2019), Japan (September 2019), and Thailand (October \n2019). (Tr. 35-45; GE 1, 2) \nApplicant testified that when she returned to the United States in January 2021, \nshe had saved about $4,000 so she could restart her life. She continued to work for the \nsame company until March 2021. While in China, her annual income was about $45,000. \nShe explained she accepted the job in China because it gave her an opportunity to work \nabroad. Her plans had been to move to Spain and work, but she canceled them due to \nfamily issues and the pandemic. (Tr. 45-49) \nApplicant disclosed in her April 2021 SCA that she failed to timely pay her 2016 \nincome taxes. She did not specify if she failed to pay both federal and state income taxes. \nShe reported in her SCA \u201cIncorrect adjustment for personal allowances under [State B] \ntaxes filing.

She further stated, \u201cWill set up payment plan to address remaining balance \nowed.\u201d (GE1) \nApplicant completed government interrogatories in October 2022. The \ninterrogatories inquired if she had filed her federal and state income tax returns from 2013 \nto 2021. For federal income tax returns, she responded \u201cn/a\u201d for tax years 2013, 2014, \nand 2015. She testified she put n/a because she was unable to retrieve the transcripts for \nthese years. For tax years 2016, 2017, 2020 and 2021, she responded \u201cyes.\u201d For tax year \n2017 she provided an IRS transcript that reflects her income tax return was not filed. She \nhad no explanation for why she failed to file.

Her October 2022 tax \ntranscripts reflect that her tax returns were not filed for 2017, 2018, and 2019. In her \ninterrogatories, she reported her total federal tax liability was $1,648, which included \npenalties and interest. She reported she did not currently have an installment agreement \nwith the IRS but had been making monthly payments of $50 before she moved to China. \n(T. 29-33, 50-57, 60-65; GE 2) \nApplicant responded to interrogatory questions about her state income tax returns. \nFor each tax year from 2013 to 2021, she responded \u201cn/a.\u201d She checked \u201cyes\u201d on the \ninterrogatory question that asked if all her state income tax returns for tax years 2013 to \n2021 were filed. She responded n/a to the question which asked her to provide her current \ntotal outstanding tax liability. Prior to 2017, Applicant lived in State A that does not have \na state income tax. State B, where she moved does have a state income tax. She testified \nthat she did not file a state income tax return for 2017. (Tr. 33-35, 57-59; GE 2) \nApplicant testified that she believed she did not have to file federal or state income \ntax returns while she was a resident and working in China. She admitted she never \nconsulted a tax professional or anyone when she drew this conclusion. IRS publication \n54 reflects that she is required to file federal income tax returns while living and working \nin a foreign country. She stated that when she prepared her returns it was electronically \nwith a software program. Her 2018 and 2019 federal and state income tax returns remain \nunfiled. She stated she filed her 2020 and 2021 federal tax returns. She provided a copy \nof her 2020 federal tax transcript which reflects a negative adjusted gross income. She \nwas asked if she reported income she earned while in China, and she said she thought \nthe tax form permitted her to report foreign income. When Applicant returned to the United \nStates in January 2021, she lived in State C and continued to work for the same company \nuntil March 2021. She stated that when she filed her 2021 federal income tax return, she \nbelieved she reported income she earned from this company. She moved about six \nmonths later to State D. Both states have income tax requirements. She indicated in her \ninterrogatories \u201cn/a\u201d for tax year 2021 regarding her state tax return. She said she filed \nher state and federal income tax returns for tax year 2022 and did not owe any taxes. The \nrecord was held open to allow her to provide evidence to show she was not required to \nfile federal income tax returns in 2018 and 2019. She did not. (Tr. 29-33, 50-59; GE 2; HE \nII) \nApplicant stopped making payments to the IRS for her 2016 tax liability when she \nmoved to China. She has not made any independent payments since then. She said she \nneeded to borrow money to get settled when she moved to China. Any tax refunds she \nwas entitled to were captured and applied to her current liability. In response to \nquestioning as to why she did not resolve the debt when she was put on further notice of \nit when she received the SOR, she said she thought her refunds would cover her tax \nliability and she was relying on them to resolve her debt. She has not contacted the IRS \nto make payment arrangements to resolve her tax liability. She reported the tax debt on \nher SCA in April 2021. (Tr. 64-67; GE 1, 2) \nApplicant provided with her interrogatories copies of federal tax transcripts. She \ntimely filed her 2021 federal income tax return.

(Tr. 80-89) \nApplicant testified that after she graduated earning her master\u2019s degree in 2020, \nshe did not make any payments towards her student loans. She confirmed her student \nloan debt with the government investigator when she was interviewed in April 2021. She \nstated she had received correspondence from one of the student loan creditors prior to \nleaving for China but could not recall the creditor. The letter put her on notice her student \nloans were due. She believed her loans were deferred. She stated, she was unable to \ncontact any of the creditors while she lived in China due to her inability to access her \naccounts. She was confronted with additional student loan accounts and said she was \nunaware of their status. She intended to contact the creditors and determine the loans \nstatus. She testified that she was aware of her obligation to pay her student loans but \nmade no attempt to do so because she was not financially stable at the time. (Tr. 81-82; \nGE 2) \nApplicant stated that in November 2022 she applied for a student loan forgiveness \nprogram and attempted to consolidate her loans. She provided a copy of a letter from the \nDOE stating she qualified for the one-time Student Loan Relief plan but there were \npending lawsuits challenging the program and she would be notified if and when they \nprevailed in court. She stated she received a letter from the creditor who held the debts \nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 1.h and 1.m. offering her the opportunity to participate in a \u201cFresh Start\u201d \nprogram. She applied for the program in June 2023 and is waiting for a response.

She was unable to identify which loans on \nthe SOR are part of the agreement. When asked if she has determined the status of all \nher student loans, she said she had not. She was to provide documentation to \nsubstantiate her actions and specify which loans she has an agreement to pay. She did \nnot provide any documents. (Tr. 22, 82-94; Answer to SOR) \nApplicant was asked if she provided the student loan creditors her forwarding \naddress or any contact information when she moved to China. She said she did not.

I may consider this information in the application of mitigating conditions, in \nmaking a credibility determination, and in my whole-person analysis. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental\nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a\nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant has delinquent student loans totaling more than $100,000 and other \ndelinquent accounts that she failed to pay. She chose to travel extensively and not \naddress her financial responsibilities. She did not contact her creditors and provide a \nforwarding address when she moved to China. She has a delinquent federal tax debt from \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2016.

She \nfailed to file her 2017 and 2021 state income tax returns. There is sufficient evidence to \nsupport the application of the above disqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant provided proof that she paid the two small debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b61.q and 1.r \nafter she received the SOR. An applicant who waits to resolve debts until after their \neligibility for a security clearance is in question may be lacking the judgment expected of \nthose with access to classified information. ISCR Case No. 16-01211 (App. Bd. May 30, \n2018) Her actions do not constitute a good-faith effort to repay her overdue creditors. AG \n\u00b6 20(d) does not apply. She also said she made an agreement to begin a payment plan \nfor some of student loans but could not identify which ones. She did not provide \ndocumentary evidence to show she has a payment agreement. The fact that she may \nhave an agreement \u201cdoes not preclude careful consideration of Applicant\u2019s security \nworthiness based on longstanding prior behavior evidencing irresponsibility.\u201d ISCR Case \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNo. 12-05053 (App. Bd.

She \nhas an unreliable financial track record. Her debts are recent and I cannot find that future \nfinancial problems are unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \nAlthough Applicant applied for a loan forgiveness program, it is unlikely, based on \nthe amount of student loans she has they would all be forgiven, even if the program makes \nit through the legal challenges. She has not received approval for the Fresh Start program \nand has not followed up. She ignored her financial obligations before applying for these \nprograms. She has been aware since at least April 2021 that her finances and student \nloans were an issue and failed to take meaningful action. A person who fails repeatedly \nto fulfill his or her legal obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good \njudgment and reliability required of those granted access to classified information. ISCR \nCase No. 15-00216 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 24, 2016), citing Cafeteria & Restaurant Workers \nUnion Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 \n(1961) \nApplicant was aware she had a federal tax liability from 2016 before she moved to \nChina. She has not made a voluntary payment to resolve this tax debt. She has relied on \ntax refunds to be involuntarily captured by the IRS and applied to the delinquent balance. \nShe did not provide evidence that she has filed her federal income tax returns for tax \nyears 2017, 2018 and 2019 or provided proof for why she was not required. She did not \nprovide proof she has filed her state income tax returns for 2017 and 2021. Applicant\u2019s \nfailure to address her tax issues \u201cdoes not reflect the voluntary compliance of rules and \nregulations expected of someone entrusted with the nation\u2019s secrets.\u201d ISCR Case No. 14\u00ad\n05794 at 7 (App. Bd. July 7, 2016.) \nPresumably Applicant attributes her financial issues to being underemployed or \nliving in China and not having access to her accounts. Her failure to advise her creditors \nof her new residence raises questions about her reliability. Based on her extensive travel, \nit is apparent, she made financial choices that did not include paying her creditors. These \nwere conditions within her control. Applicant disputes certain debts that remain on her \ncredit report. She did not provide evidence of legitimacy of her dispute or her actions to \nresolve the debts. There is no evidence she received financial counseling. I conclude \nnone of the remaining mitigating conditions apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nThe record evidence leaves me with serious questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F, \nfinancial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.p: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.q-1.r: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph   1.s-1.u: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Applicant did not provide many details about his \nbusiness, but disclosed for the first time he used credit card accounts to finance it. (Item \n1 at 3) \nThe SOR alleges four delinquent debts totaling about $61,000. Applicant admitted \nall debts.

As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d EO 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d EO 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nnot met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988); see AG \u00b6 2(b). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially relevant in this case: \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; and \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence in this FORM establish the above \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), and 19(c) are applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially relevant: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not\ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment; \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6  20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control;  \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \nAG \u00b6 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are recent and ongoing. \nHis longstanding delinquent debts in this SOR remain unresolved. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not fully established. Applicant likely experienced financial strain after \nbeing terminated from his position in May 2017, followed by a 12-month period of \nunemployment, and part-time employment outside of his technical field. During this \nperiod, he was a stay-at-home father supported by his wife and unemployment benefits. \nHe later revealed that he used this period of unemployment to launch his own business. \nHe did not disclose much information about the business, other than the fact he used \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncredit card accounts to finance his business; and that the business ultimately \u201cfailed \nmiserably\u201d and he was now paying for it. The record lacks sufficient information about the \nbusiness to fully evaluate the meaning of this comment. Applicant failed to provide \ninformation or evidence concerning his income, expenses, or other financial resources at \nhis disposal such as bank checking and savings accounts, retirement accounts, or other \nassets of value. He has not established he acted responsibly under the circumstances. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is not established. Applicant did not provide information or evidence he \nreceived or is receiving financial counseling. His financial problems are not under control. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is not established. Although the most recent credit bureau report shows \na $65 reduction in the balance of SOR \u00b6 1.c, the reason for the balance reduction is \nunclear. Applicant has not produced evidence showing he has a plan in place to repay \ndelinquent debts and that that he is adhering to the plan. He failed to establish that he \ninitiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay his delinquent debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(e) is not established. Although two delinquent debts alleged in the SOR \nwere disputed, Applicant did not elaborate or comment on this; neither did he present \nindependent evidence to support a reasonable basis to dispute these delinquent debts. \nIn sum, there is insufficient evidence for a determination that Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems will be resolved within a reasonable period of time. I am unable to find that he \nacted responsibly under the circumstances or that he made a good-faith effort to pay his \ndebts. His financial issues continue to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, \nand good judgment. I find that financial considerations security concerns remain despite \nthe presence of some mitigation. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

Eligibility \nfor access to classified information or to hold a sensitive position is granted \nStatement of the Case \nOn November 3, 2022, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency \n(DCSA) Consolidated Central Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing reasons why under the financial considerations \nand personal conduct guidelines the DCSA CAF could not make the preliminary \naffirmative determination of eligibility for granting a security clearance, and \nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a security \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. The action was taken \nunder Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960); DoD Directive 5220.6 Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program, (January 2, 1992) (Directive); and Security \nExecutive Agent Directive 4, establishing in Appendix A the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective June 8, 2017. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                                                                                          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on March 14, 2023, and requested a hearing. \nThis case was assigned to me on June 29, 2023. A hearing was scheduled for August \n4, 2023, via Microsoft Teams Teleconference Services, and was heard as scheduled. At \nthe hearing, the Government\u2019s case consisted of eight exhibits. (GEs 1-8) Applicant \nrelied on two witnesses (including himself) and five exhibits, which were admitted as \nAEs A-E without objection. The transcript (Tr.) was received on August 14, 2023. \nSummary of Pleadings \nUnder Guideline F of the SOR, Applicant allegedly accumulated five delinquent \nDepartment of Education (DoE) student loan debts exceeding $22,000. Allegedly, his \nstudent loans remain unresolved and outstanding. \nUnder Guideline E, Applicant allegedly falsified his Electronic Questionnaires for \nElectronic Processing (e-QIP) of November 30, 2020, by omitting his DoE student loans \nin default. Allegedly, his omissions were made deliberately. \nIn her response to the SOR, Applicant denied being delinquent in the repayment \nof his DoE student loans and denied any falsification of his e-QIP with explanations and \nclarifications. He claimed he was being honest in completing his e-QIP at all times. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 42-year-old employee of a defense contractor who seeks a security \nclearance. Admitted facts are adopted and incorporated by reference. Additional \nfindings of fact follow. \nBackground \nApplicant married in June 2006 and has two children (ages 10 and 21) from this \nmarriage. (GE 1; Tr. 36) He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in May 2017. (GE 1; Tr. 86) He \nenlisted in the Marine Corps in January 2000 and served 12 years of active duty before \nhis retirement in July 2012 with an honorable discharge. (GE 1; Tr. 37) \nSince December 2017, Applicant has worked for his current employer as a logs \nand records specialist. (GE 1; Tr. 71) He reported unemployment between August 2016 \nand December 2017 and brief employment with another employer between June 2016 \nand August 2018. (GE 1) Applicant reported another period of unemployment between \nJuly 2012 and May 2013 following his military discharge. (GE 1) He has held a security \nclearance since 2018. (GE 1) \nApplicant\u2019s finances \nBetween 2013 and 2017, Applicant took out student loans with the (DoE) to \nfinance his college education. Altogether, Applicant accumulated student loans \n2 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nexceeding $22,000. (GEs 2, 5-8) Beginning in 2017 (following the expiration of his \nstudent loan forbearance from the DoE, he made payments to a third-party intermediary \nwho he believed at the time to be forwarding his payments (through his spouse who \nmanages his finances) to the DoE through an authorized DoE agent intermediary. (GE \n3; Tr. 26-28, 50-56, 80-83) This agent intermediary failed to forward Applicant\u2019s \npayments on to the DoE as required by Applicant\u2019s payment agreement. (Tr. 31-34). \nThe intermediary has since been liquidated and is unavailable to account for the \npayments that Applicant made. (Tr. 46-47) \nApplicant has the means to pay his student loan debts as they become due and \nis currently in good standing with the DoE on his student loans. (AEs A-E and G; Tr. 58-\n62, and 85-87) He currently earns around $80,000 a year from his work and receives an \nadditional $20,000 a year in Veterans Administration (VA) disability payments. (Tr. 43-\n44, 75) \nBased on a review of the record as a whole, Applicant\u2019s documented evidence is \nsufficient to surmount the Government\u2019s prima facie case. Applicant\u2019s evidence \nsubstantively and credibly explained, extenuated, and mitigated the Government\u2019s \nconcerns about the state of Applicant\u2019s finances. Under the Adjudicative Guidelines \ncovering financial consideration concerns, Applicant\u2019s student loan delinquencies have \nbeen extenuated and mitigated under the applicable mitigating conditions (MCs) as \nfollows: MC \u00b6\u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency a death, divorce or separation, clear victimization by \npredatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the individual acted responsibly under \nthe circumstances,\u201d and 20(d), \u201cthe individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith \neffort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d \nAddressing the allegations of Applicant\u2019s falsifying his e-QIP, Applicant\u2019s \npresented evidence of a good-faith misunderstanding of his being delinquent on his \nstudent loan obligations is both credible and convincing. Based on a full and careful \nconsideration of the Government\u2019s evidence and Applicant\u2019s challenges, inferences and \nconclusions are warranted that allegations of falsification of Applicant\u2019s e-QIP are \nunsubstantiated. \nConsidering both the applicable mitigating conditions covered by Guideline F and \nthe absence of substantiating evidence of falsification, a whole-person assessment of \nApplicant\u2019s clearance eligibility is supported by a sufficient demonstration of restored \nfinancial responsibility by Applicant in the management of his finances to enable him to \nmaintain sufficient control of his finances to meet minimum standards for holding a \nsecurity clearance. \n3 \n I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and \ncircumstances in the context of the whole person. And, I conclude financial \nconsiderations and personal conduct security concerns are fully mitigated.

(AppX A.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used \nin evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nFinally, Section 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline D - Sexual Behavior \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Sexual Behavior is set out in AG \n\u00b6 12: \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of judgment \nor discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence of coercion, \nexploitation, or duress. These issues, together or individually, may raise \nquestions about an individual's judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Sexual behavior \nincludes conduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, electronic, or \nwritten transmission. No adverse inference concerning the standards in this \nGuideline may be raised solely on the basis of the sexual orientation of the \nindividual. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 13. Two are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has \nbeen prosecuted; and \n(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant received sexual gratification at massage parlors on multiple occasions. \nHis conduct is criminal and represents a pattern of high-risk sexual behavior that reflects \na lack of discretion or judgment. It also creates a vulnerability to coercion, exploitation \nand duress. The evidence is sufficient to raise these disqualifying conditions. \nAG \u00b6 14 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 14 including: \n(a) the behavior occurred prior to or during adolescence and there is no \nevidence of subsequent conduct of a similar nature; \n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under \nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment; \n(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; \n(d) the sexual behavior is strictly private, consensual, and discreet; and \n(e) the individual has successfully completed an appropriate program of \ntreatment, or is currently enrolled in one, has demonstrated ongoing and \nconsistent compliance with the treatment plan, and/or has received a \nfavorable prognosis from a qualified mental health professional indicating \nthe behavior is readily controllable with treatment. \nNone of the above mitigating conditions apply. Applicant\u2019s sexual misbehavior \noccurred for more than a decade. It ceased recently, less than two years ago. Sexual \nBehavior is found against Applicant. \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 30 sets forth the security concerns pertaining to criminal conduct: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes one condition that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \nApplicant\u2019s ten plus years of sexual criminal conduct creates doubt about \nApplicant\u2019s judgment. The evidence establishes the above disqualifying condition. \nAG \u00b6 32 provides two conditions that could mitigate the above security concerns \nraised in this case: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to \nthe passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nNeither of these apply. It is too soon to say that Applicant\u2019s recent fairly and \nextensive past criminal conduct is not of present security significance. This should not \ndissuade Applicant, with the passage of more time, from reappling for a security \nclearance, but that time is not the present. Criminal Conduct is found against Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s national security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct \nand all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. The record evidence leaves me \nwith questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security \nconcerns arising under Guidelines D, Sexual Behavior, and J, Criminal Conduct. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline D: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \n  Conclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant access to classified \ninformation.

Applicant timely answered the SOR \nand requested a hearing. Department Counsel subsequently sent Applicant an \nAmended SOR on March 9, 2023 adding two allegations under financial considerations. \nApplicant timely answered the Amended SOR. \nThe case was assigned to another administrative judge on March 15, 2023; and \non March 27, 2023, the case was reassigned to me. The hearing was held as scheduled \non April 18, 2023. After reviewing the transcript and evidence, I proposed to the parties \nthat this case was appropriate for a summary disposition in Applicant\u2019s favor. Both \nparties had ten days to consider the matter and to provide written notice of their \nobjections. Neither party objected. \nIn summary, this case centers on marital debt and child support that Applicant \nincurred as a result of his 2017 divorce from his first wife. The SOR and Amended SOR \nallege eight debts totaling approximately $56,537. Applicant\u2019s former spouse was \nrequired to pay her share of the community property debt; however, she failed to do so. \nApplicant has made a determined and measured effort to pay off his post-divorce/SOR \ndebts. \nApplicant has a total of five minor children, four with his first and former wife, and \none with his second and current wife. His wife and five minor children are dependent on \nhim for financial support. Applicant retired in 2018 from the U.S. Navy after 20 years of \nhonorable service. He successfully held a security clearance for 25 years, has an \nexcellent work record, and submitted a budget demonstrating that he leads a modest \nlifestyle and lives with his means. \nBased on the record evidence as a whole, I conclude that Department Counsel \npresented sufficient evidence to establish the facts alleged in the SOR under Guideline \nF. I also conclude that Applicant presented sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate the facts admitted by Applicant or proven by Department Counsel. In particular, \nI conclude that the security concerns are resolved under the following mitigating \nconditions: AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), and 20(d).  \n \n \nThe concerns over Applicant\u2019s history of financial problems do not create doubt \nabout his current reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect \nclassified information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence as a whole \nand considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence or vice \nversa. I also gave due consideration to the whole-person concept. Accordingly, I \nconclude that he met his ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. This case is decided for Applicant. \nROBERT TUIDER \nAdministrative Judge \n2 \n",

He has been \nemployed with the defense contractor since February of 2022. He is divorced, and has \none child. (GX 1 at pages 5, 12, 24~25 and 29.) Applicant blames his current financial \nsituation a period of unemployment, COVID-19, making \u201csome bad financial decisions,\u201d \nand \u201cliving without . . . [his] means.\u201d (TR at page 15 line 1 to page 17 line 1.) \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \n1.a. Applicant filed for the protection of a Chapter 7 bankruptcy in June of 2018; \nand as a result, his debts at that time were discharged in September of 2018. (Id, and \nGX 5.) Since that discharge, Applicant has accumulated additional past-due \nindebtedness, listed below. \n1.b.~1.d. and 1.f. Applicant admits past-due debts to four different creditors \ntotaling about $19,835. (TR at page 17 line 15 to page 21 line 3.) Applicant\u2019s plan of \naction was to take no affirmative action, but to wait for his creditors to \u201creach out\u201d to \nApplicant. (TR at page 14 lines 9 to 24.) He was informed that this lack of action was \nnot a good-faith effort to address his past-due indebtedness (TR at page 18 lines 1~13.) \nApplicant has submitted nothing further in this regard. These past-due debts are found \nagainst Applicant. \n1.e. Applicant denies a past-due debt to Creditor E in the amount of $87. (TR at \npage 13 line 1 to page 14 line 8.) As this debt still appears as \u201coutstanding\u201d on one of \nthe Government\u2019s March 2022 credit reports (GX 3 at page 5), this allegation is found \nagainst Applicant. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative \njudge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \nnational security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process.

According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall \nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(e) consistent spending beyond one's means or frivolous or irresponsible \nspending, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant \nnegative cash flow, a history of late payments or of non-payment, or other \nnegative financial indicators. \nApplicant has significant post-bankruptcy, past-due indebtedness. The evidence \nis sufficient to raise these disqualifying conditions. \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 including: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nNone of these apply. Applicant\u2019s financial problems are ongoing. He has a long \nhistory of delinquencies. At his hearing, Applicant was informed of the consequences of \nhis inaction, however, he has done nothing since his hearing to address his debts. \nMitigation under AG \u00b6 20 has not been established. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with \nquestions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nFor all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the Financial \nConsiderations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a.~1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nRichard A. Cefola \nAdministrative Judge \n5 \n",

These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person.

This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 \n7). Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has \nnot met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. (Egan at 531). \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d \nis \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d (See v. Washington Metro. Area \nTransit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)). The guidelines presume a nexus or \nrational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed therein and \nan applicant\u2019s security suitability. (ISCR Case No. 92-1106 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993)). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the \nburden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. (Directive \n\u00b6 E3.1.15). An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden \nof disproving it never shifts to the Government. (ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. \nSep. 22, 2005)). \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002)). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan at 531; AG \u00b6 2(b)). \n \n \n \n \n \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above.  \nThe record evidence establishes the following disqualifying conditions under this \nguideline: \nAG \u00b6 25(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \nAG \u00b6 25(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including \ncultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or \npossession of drug paraphernalia. \nI, sua sponte, took administrative notice that, in December 2021, the Office of the \nDirector of National Intelligence (DNI) issued updated guidance reaffirming that federal \nlaw remains unchanged with respect to marijuana use, possession, production and \ndistribution; and that individuals who hold security clearances or occupy a sensitive \nposition within the federal government are currently prohibited by law from using \ncontrolled substances, such as marijuana, on or off-duty. The guidance also made clear \nthat prior recreational marijuana use by an individual applying for a security clearance or \nnational security position might be relevant to adjudications, but not determinative. The \nguidance instructed federal agencies to adjudicate each potential applicant through a \n\"whole-person concept\" by evaluating multiple variables in an individual's life to determine \nwhether past marijuana use raises a security concern and whether that concern has been \nmitigated. \nHaving considered all the factors set forth in AG \u00b6 26 that could mitigate the \nconcern under this guideline, I find the following warrant further discussion: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) providing a \nsigned statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \nApplicant\u2019s regular marijuana use spanned a period of ten years, well into \nadulthood. His Adderall misuse occurred for an extended period of four years. While \ninfrequent, his use of LSD and cocaine raises further questions about his judgment and \nwillingness to comply with rules. I considered that Applicant stopped using drugs prior to \napplying for a security clearance and changed his environment. However sincere his \nprofessed commitment to abstinence may be, he has not established a sufficient pattern \nof abstinence in light of the recency and circumstances of his drug use. He did not provide \nthe signed statement of intent described in AG \u00b6 26(b)(3). I have doubts about his \nreliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. Neither AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) nor 26(b) are established. \nAccordingly, I conclude that Applicant failed to meet his burden to mitigate the Guideline \nH concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nadjudicative guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole \nperson. In evaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, an administrative judge \nshould consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline H in my whole-person analysis, \nand considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) and the DNI\u2019s December 2021 guidance. Because \nApplicant elected a decision on the written record in lieu of a hearing, I did not have the \nopportunity to ask him questions about his conduct, or to assess his credibility. After \nweighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline H, and evaluating all \nthe evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude that Applicant has not \nmitigated the Guideline H security concerns. Accordingly, Applicant has not carried his \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nburden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him\neligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to \ngrant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

Or. 10865, \u00a7 2. The \nU.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive Branch in \nregulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing that \u201cno one \nhas a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 \n(1988). \nThe AG list disqualifying and mitigating conditions for evaluating a person\u2019s \nsuitability for access to classified information. Any one disqualifying or mitigating condition \nis not, by itself, conclusive. However, the AG should be followed where a case can be \nmeasured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to classified \ninformation. Each decision must reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense consideration \nof the whole person and the factors listed in National Security Adjudicative Guidelines \n(Security Executive Agent Directive 4, effective June 8, 2017, or SEAD 4) App. A \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) \nand 2(f). All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, must be considered. \nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government \nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, the \nburden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. The \napplicant bears the heavy burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue his or her security clearance. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship with \nthe Government based on trust and confidence.

The \u201cclearly \nconsistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt \nabout an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. \nat 531; SEAD 4, \u00b6 E(4); SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 1(d) and 2(b). Clearance decisions are not \na determination of the loyalty of the applicant concerned. They are merely an indication \nthat the applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines the Government has established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nIn reaching my decision, I specifically considered the following: \nOn October 25, 2014, the Director of National Intelligence Memorandum \nAdherence to Federal Laws Prohibiting Marijuana Use, made it clear that state laws do \nnot authorize citizens to violate federal law, including the Controlled Substances Act (21 \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 801-971 (1970)), which identifies marijuana as a Schedule I controlled drug.  \nChanges to state laws or the District of Columbia, pertaining to marijuana use do \nnot alter the existing National Security Adjudicative Guidelines. An individual's disregard \nof federal law pertaining to the use, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains \nadjudicatively relevant in national security determinations. The adjudicative authority \nmust determine if the use of, or involvement with, marijuana raises questions about the \nindividual's judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and willingness to comply with law, \nrules, and regulations, including federal laws, when making eligibility decisions of persons \nproposed for, or occupying, sensitive national security positions. \nOn December 21, 2021, the Director of National Intelligence signed the \nmemorandum, Security Executive Agent Clarifying Guidance Concerning Marijuana for \nAgencies Conducting Adjudications of Persons Proposed for Eligibility for Access to \nClassified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position. It emphasizes that federal \nlaw remains unchanged with respect to the illegal use, possession, production and \ndistribution of marijuana. Individuals who hold a clearance or occupy a sensitive position \nare prohibited by law from using controlled substances. Disregard of federal law \npertaining to marijuana (including prior recreational marijuana use) remains relevant, but \nnot determinative, to adjudications of eligibility. Agencies are required to use the \u201cwhole-\nperson concept\u201d stated under SEAD 4, to determine whether the applicant\u2019s behavior \nraises a security concern that has not been mitigated. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n  \n \nAnalysis \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nAG \u00b6 24 articulates the security concern for the illegal use of drugs: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nApplicant used marijuana with varying frequency, from about July 2016 to January \n2023. Of increased concern, he used marijuana in January 2023, after submitting a \nsecurity clearance application and after being granted a security clearance in October \n2021. Applicant admitted to using the prescription drug Adderall, without a prescription, \non one occasion in October 2020 while he was in college. \nApplicant indicated on his May 2021 SCA that he did not intend to use marijuana \nin the future while it was still illegal under federal law. He acknowledged knowing that the \nuse of marijuana was illegal under federal and state law, and that his employer has a \npolicy against employees using illegal drugs. \nAG \u00b6 25 provides disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse;  \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n(f) any illegal drug while granted access to classified information, or holding \na sensitive position. \nAll of the above disqualifying conditions apply. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(c) apply with \nregard to Applicant\u2019s illegal use and purchase of marijuana from 2016 to 2023. He also \nused the prescription drug Adderall in October 2020 although it was not prescribed to him. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 25(f) applies because Applicant purchased and used marijuana in January \n2023 after being granted access to classified information in October 2021. The use of \nmarijuana remains illegal under federal law. While the record is not clear about whether \nApplicant actively worked with classified information in January 2023, he was granted a \nsecurity clearance in October 2021. \nThe record established the above disqualifying conditions. An evaluation of \napplicable mitigating conditions is required. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nThe Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the \napplicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd.

This was a one- \ntime use. It occurred over two years ago and is unlikely to recur.  \nConsidering Applicant\u2019s history of marijuana abuse, none of the mitigating \nconditions apply in regards to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.c. Applicant has a long history of \nmarijuana use. His last use of marijuana was in January 2023. His last use was recent, \nafter being granted a security clearance and after his expressed intent to refrain from \nillegal marijuana use in the future during his security clearance background investigation. \nAG \u00b6 26(a) does not apply.  \nWhile Applicant is given credit for self-reporting his January 2023 marijuana use, \nthe January 2023 use still raises questions about his judgment. He knew that the use of \nmarijuana is illegal under federal law, and that his employer has a policy against \nemployees using illegal drugs. He illegally used marijuana after he was granted a security \nclearance in October 2021 and after he expressed his intent to discontinue marijuana \nuse. Considering Applicant and his friend visited a marijuana dispensary while he was \nvisiting his friend in January 2023, and that he purchased some marijuana for his friend \nas a thank you for hosting him, the evidence is inconclusive as to whether he has \ndisassociated from his marijuana-using friends. AG \u00b6 26(b)(1) does not apply. \nApplicant did not submit a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse. AG \u00b6 26(b)(3) does not apply. Even if he did, the \nstatement would carry less weight considering his continued use of marijuana despite \npast expressed intentions to no longer use marijuana. \nApplicant\u2019s possession and use of marijuana casts doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, good judgment, and his ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. His suitability to hold a clearance is questionable, especially because his \nmost recent substance misuse occurred after applying for and being granted a security \nclearance. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nSOR \u00b6 1.c is cross-alleged under the Personal Conduct concern. I find that the \nconcern was covered adequately under the Drug Involvement and Substance Abuse \nconcerns discussed above. I find for Applicant regarding the Guideline E concern. \nWhole-Person Concept \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case, and under the whole-person concept. \nSEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and 2(d).

Some of these factors were addressed under that guideline, \nbut some warrant additional comment. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n         \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nApplicant is a 24-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He has been working \nfor his employer since July 2020. He illegally used marijuana between 2016 and January \n2023. Applicant\u2019s lack of judgment and his unwillingness to comply with federal rules and \nregulations continue to raise serious questions about his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information. Considering the \nrecord as a whole, the passage of time since his most recent marijuana use is insufficient \nto establish that his use of marijuana is unlikely to recur. The drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse security concerns are not mitigated. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest of the United States to grant Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance.

Due to her husband\u2019s medical issues, she was \nunemployed at various times between 2012 and 2019. (Item 13 at 2.) She enrolled the \ndebts delineated in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1c and 1.e-1.f totaling about $43,435, in a payment plan \nwith a debt relief company in 2019. (Item 13 at 3.) The Government withdrew these \nallegations on the basis that she had resolved or sufficiently mitigated them. \nThe evidence concerning the two remaining delinquent debts totaling $63,005 is \nsummarized below. \nSOR \u00b6 1.a: past-due account charged off in the amount of $56,612. Applicant\u2019s \ndebt arose from a second mortgage on a previous residence. Her husband got sick right \nafter they bought a new home. She paid the doctors first to get the help her husband \nneeded. (Item 13 at 4.) The home was sold in a short sale arranged by her husband in \n2016, which she believed was supposed to have covered the delinquency. (Item 14 at 7.) \nIn July 2022, a Writ of Garnishment was issued against Applicant's wages to satisfy the \ndebt. She stated she was never served with the court papers, which resulted in the default \njudgment. She contacted a law firm to seek assistance in reaching a settlement with the \ncreditor. The law firm stated that efforts to negotiate a settlement had been unsuccessful \nto date. (Item 3.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.d: past-due account charged off in the amount of $6,393. Applicant \ndenied SOR \u00b6 1.d on the basis she was unaware of the debt and would have enrolled it \nin the debt relief payment plan. (Item 13 at 5; Item 14 at 7; Answer.) The debt is held by \nthe same creditor as SOR \u00b6 1.a, and she believes may be linked to the mortgage and \nshort sale. She states she has not heard from the creditor. (Item 13 at 5.) In both ESIs \nshe stated she was unaware of the debt and why it was coming up. (Item 13 at 5 and Item \n14 at 7.) \nApplicant states she has worked to avoid having to file for bankruptcy. She has \nbeen using a debt relief company since 2019, prior to the start of the security clearance \nprocess, to resolve her debts.

These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant's admissions and the documentary evidence in the FORM establish the \nfollowing disqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy\ndebts\u201d) and AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are relevant: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nA security clearance adjudication is an evaluation of an individual\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness. It is not a debt-collection procedure. See ISCR Case No. \n09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). Prior to the SOR being issued Applicant set in motion \na plan to resolve the majority of her debts that were alleged on the original SOR.  \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is established. Applicant's delinquent debts arose during a change of \nemployment status shortly after her husband fell ill resulting in her being unemployed at \nvarious times between 2012 and 2019, while accumulating medical bills.

SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.d are unresolved but under these limited \ncircumstances, given her actions by using a debt relief company prior to the start of the \nsecurity clearance process to resolve her other delinquent accounts demonstrates her \ncurrent reliability and trustworthiness to resolve these remaining debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is established. Applicant cites her husband\u2019s medical issues and \nunemployment as conditions largely beyond her control. Her new employment status has \ncoincided with her track record of reducing her debts. An applicant is not held to a \nstandard of perfection in her debt-resolution efforts or required to be debt-free. \u201cRather, \nall that is required is that [she] act responsibly given her circumstances and develop a \nreasonable plan for repayment, accompanied by \u2018concomitant conduct,\u2019 that is, actions \nwhich evidence a serious intent to effectuate the plan.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-02903 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Mar. 9, 2017). Her actions demonstrate she will address her remaining debts, \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.d. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is established. Applicant provided evidence to support her assertions \nthat she had resolved debts listed on the SOR, and the Government acknowledged those \nactions by its withdrawal of SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1c and 1.e-1.f. Applicant\u2019s actions demonstrate \nshe understands what she needs to do to establish and maintain her financial \nresponsibility and resolve SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.d. She has taken reasonable actions under \nher unique financial circumstances to address her delinquent debts and has established \na \u201cmeaningful track record of debt reduction.\u201d See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. \nBd. May 21, 2008). \nApplicant does not present a perfect case in mitigation, but perfection is not \nrequired. Under the limited circumstances of this case, I find that her finances no longer \ngenerate questions about her judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified information. Security concerns about her finances are mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Overall, the record evidence \nleaves me without questions or doubts about Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance.

On March 22, 2023, Applicant filed a response with the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA). The Government indicated it had no objection to the \nresponse. The case file was assigned to me on April 26, 2023. \nRulings on Procedure \nIn a footnote on the second page of the FORM dated February 22, 2023, \nDepartment Counsel informed Applicant that her April 24, 2018 PSI (Item 7) would be \nexcluded from evidence if she objected to the exhibit. Alternatively, Department Counsel \nadvised her that she could correct, update, or modify the exhibit to improve its clarity or \naccuracy. Applicant did not object to this exhibit or any of the other four items. See, \nE3.1.20. of DOD Directive 5220.6, page 52. All items were admitted into evidence. \nOn page 3 of the FORM, and pursuant to \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.13 and E3.1.17 o DOD \nDirective 5220.6, the Government moved to amend SOR \u00b6 1.a of the SOR as follows: \n1.a \u2013 You are indebted to a creditor for an account that has been charged off in \nthe amount of $18,801.00. As of the date of the SOR, the account remains delinquent. \nIn her March 2023 response to the FORM, Applicant submitted the SOR \u00b6 1.a \ncreditor\u2019s offer of settlement letter dated February 3, 2023. The total amount due was \nposted as $18,801.66, rather than the $13,654 amount posted in the SOR.

She revealed \nin her June 2018 e-QIP that she was delinquent to the SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b creditors. \n(GE 3 at 23-27; March 9, 2023 response to the FORM) \nBefore Applicant\u2019s employment as a management assistant for a few months in \n2018, she was a bartender for six months in December 2017 to June 2018. She was \nunemployed from May 2016 to December 2017. Before her unemployment, she was a \ntechnical editor and analyst from July 2012 to April 2016. She was also a technical \neditor for another employer from March 2012 to July 2012. (Item 3 at 14-17) \nSOR \u00b6 1.a \u2013 This is a delinquent credit-card account totaling $18,801.00. The \nlast payment activity on the account was in in July 2017, during Applicant\u2019s \nunemployment \nfrom \nMay \n2016 \nto \nDecember \n2017, \nand \nher \nhusband\u2019s \nunderemployment, that was not as stable as his former employment in the federal \nsector. When the creditor no longer accepted smaller payments, she saved her money \nuntil she successfully settled the account in March 2023 for $9,400. (Item 3 at 14-23; \nMarch 2023 letter at 2; Attachment A, presented check #3923) This account is resolved. \nSOR 1.b \u2013 In the Government\u2019s February 2023 credit bureau report (CBR), this \ncredit-card account is classified as charged-off with a past-due amount of $579. This \naccount is posted as closed in the Government\u2019s February 2022 CBR, with a delinquent \nbalance of $4,268, the same amount appearing in the SOR. Applicant\u2019s documented \npayment record shows she has been making regular payments to the creditor since \nJune 2016. Her payments since August 2020, which have not been more than $100 \nmonthly, though probably not the amount required under the terms of the credit-card \ncontract, demonstrate her willingness to pay a small amount each month to eventually \nreturn the account to a current status. (Item 4 at 7; Item 5 at 2; Attachment E) The \naccount is being resolved. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d \u2013 These are two student loans that Applicant received. \nApplicant was working as a technical writer for a company from 2012 to 2016.

When she did not make the loan payments, they became \ndelinquent. See \u00b6\u00b6 SOR 1.c and 1.d. In October 2022, Applicant filed a student loan \ndebt relief application. The application is pending. Meanwhile for COVID-related \nreasons, the U.S. Department of Education suspended Applicant\u2019s student loan \nrepayments until June 30, 2023.

(March 9, 2023 response to FORM, \nAttachment D, at 18-19) \nCharacter Evidence \nIn February 2013, Applicant revitalized her religious commitment and \neffectiveness as a technical editor. She believes that she has her life pointed in a \nhealthy and positive direction. She is dedicated to keeping her finances current. (March \n9, 2023 response to the SOR, at 2) With financial counseling and utilization of a budget, \nI strongly believe that Applicant\u2019s past financial problems will not recur. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines and all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. These guidelines, which are flexible rules of law, are applied together with \ncommon sense and the general factors of the whole-person concept. The protection of \nthe national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(d) requires that \u201c[a]ny \ndoubt concerning personnel being considered for national security eligibility will be \nresolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security decision. \n4 \n\n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18. Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nAG \u00b6 19. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying include: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nIn July 2017, Applicant began accumulating delinquent debt. By the time the \nSOR was issued in February 2023, Applicant had incurred $25,118 in delinquent debt.\nAG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply.\n \n \nAG \u00b6 20. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n5 \n\n   \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and 20(b) apply to mitigate Applicant\u2019s delinquent delinquencies. \nWhile there are only six debts that became delinquent, it did not take long before \nApplicant\u2019s abuse of her credit cards caused her overall debt to spiral out-of-control. I \nam convinced that Applicant\u2019s financial problems were caused primarily by the \ncircumstances \nof \nher \nunemployment \nand \nexacerbated \nby \nher \nhusband\u2019s \nunderemployment for one and a half years between May 2016 and December 2017. \nWhen she was able, she took documented action to resolve all the debts listed in the \nSOR. Her actions to responsibly resolve the delinquent debts entitle her to full credit \nunder the second prong of AG \u00b6 20(b). She receives commensurate credit under AG \u00b6 \n20(d) for making a good-faith effort to repay her debts. \nThough Applicant has not had financial counseling, she has exercised common \nsense in tackling her financial problems. Rather than abandoning her financial obligation \nto resolve SOR \u00b6 1.a when the creditor refused to accept her partial payments, she \nsaved her money over time and was able to settle the debt in March 2023. AG \u00b6 20(c) \napplies in part. \nWhole-Person Concept \nI have examined the evidence under the guideline for financial considerations in \nthe context of the nine general factors of the whole-person concept listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \naccess to classified information must be an overall common-sense judgment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nApplicant is 53 years and has been married since 2003. She has one 32-year-\nold son and one 26-year-old stepson. She has been a technical editor for 14 years of \nher professional career. Within a month of the issuance of the SOR, Applicant satisfied \nfour of the six debts. Repayment of the two federal student loan debts has been paused \nby the Government until June 30, 2023. I recommend that Applicant take financial \ncounseling to increase her knowledge of responsible management and monitoring of \nher finances, especially her use of credit.

The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept.

This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to \npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F -  Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Four are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant has incurred delinquent debts including back taxes that she has not \nbeen able to pay. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \nThe following mitigating conditions under the Financial Considerations guideline \nare potentially applicable under AG \u00b6 20; \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g. loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;     \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority to file \nor pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those arrangements. \nThere is nothing in the record to demonstrate that Applicant has made efforts to \nmitigate the Government\u2019s concerns under Guideline F. Without documentary evidence \nsubstantiating her assertions that she has been making payments to the creditors, that \nshe is currently financially responsible, and that she is able to meet her future financial \nobligations, Applicant has not carried her burden of proof to establish mitigation of the \nsecurity concerns alleged in the SOR. Applicant provides no reasonable excuse for her \nexcessive indebtedness or why it still exists when she has been employed on a full-time \nbasis since October 2021. If she has started to repay any of her creditors, she has \nsubmitted no documentary evidence to substantiate this. From the limited evidence \npresented, her debts remain delinquent and owing. Applicant\u2019s inaction for so long \nreflects a pattern of unreliability, untrustworthiness, and poor judgment. Accordingly, \nApplicant does not meet the requirements to access classified information. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I conclude Applicant has not \nmitigated the Financial Considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.g. \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information \nis denied. \nDarlene Lokey Anderson \nAdministrative Judge \n6 \n",

Applicant\u2019s testimony was forthright and his \nintegrity was apparent. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration \nof the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse is set forth at AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 25 contains seven conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying. Two conditions are established: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia. \nAppellant used a plethora of illegal substances over a period of nine years. \nTherefore, AG \u00b6 25 (a) and (c) are established. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 26 contains four conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. Two conditions may be applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;  \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and  \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility. \nApplicant\u2019s illegal substance misuse ceased less than a year prior to his hearing. \nAlthough he now signed letters of intent eschewing future usage, it is too soon to say \nnine years of drug involvement is not of present security significance. Drug Involvement \nand Substance Misuse is found against Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nAG \u00b6 2(b) requires each case must be judged on its own merits. Under AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant or continue national security \neligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is clearly respected both \nat his workplace and in his community. (AppXs D~P.) However, overall, the record \nevidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s present eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has not \nmitigated the security concerns arising from his drug involvement and substance abuse. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a.~1.g: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The SOR alleges foreign influence security concerns based on Applicant\u2019s family members and friends in Iraq. In her Answer, Applicant admitted all of the allegations. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact: Applicant is 42 years old. She was born in Baghdad, Iraq. In March 2003, U.S. forces invaded Iraq vowing to destroy Iraqi weapons of mass destruction and end the dictatorial rule of Saddam Hussein. Applicant and her husband were Iraqi citizens, and they had a young son and two daughters. In early 2006, Applicant\u2019s husband worked for the United States forces in Iraq as a local hire Arabic linguist. After working for a few months, he was killed by an improvised explosive device while he was performing his duties as a translator. At that time, Applicant was 23 years-old and had three young children. In 2008, she applied for refugee status in the United States. In 2010, she received approximately $442,000 of life insurance money from the U.S. Army following the death of her husband. She placed the insurance proceeds into an Iraqi bank account. She arrived in the U.S. in September 2012 with her children, and she became a naturalized U.S. citizen in December 2017.

In her Answer, Applicant admitted all of the allegations. After \na thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following findings \nof fact: \nApplicant is 42 years old. She was born in Baghdad, Iraq. In March 2003, U.S. \nforces invaded Iraq vowing to destroy Iraqi weapons of mass destruction and end the \ndictatorial rule of Saddam Hussein. Applicant and her husband were Iraqi citizens, and \nthey had a young son and two daughters.

Her son and two daughters, now ages 22, 18 \nand 17 respectively, reside with Applicant in her home. They are U.S. citizens. (GE 1-3; \nTr. 17-18, 24, 27-30, 41-45, 51) \nIn 2021, Applicant applied to work for a government contractor as a linguist. She \nwas offered a job, but her employment is contingent on her obtaining a DOD security \nclearance. She decided to apply for this position because her children are older and can \ntake care of themselves. She does not consider herself to be a dual citizen and claims \nallegiance to the United States only. She currently works for a company in Iraq that is \nsimilar to Amazon. Her friend owns the company, and she is paid $3,400 per month as \nan employee. Applicant ships items from the U.S. to the company\u2019s customers in Iraq. \nThe owner, originally from Iraq, is a U.S. citizen living in the U.S. (GE 1 and 2; Tr. 59-61) \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \nFrom September 2012 to September 2020, (actually late 2019), Applicant received \napproximately $3,000 to $4,000 monthly from her father in Baghdad, Iraq. (SOR \u00b6 1.g) \nThe money was sent to her via Western Union. The monthly payments were from the life \ninsurance payout of $442,000 she received in 2010 and deposited into an Iraqi bank \naccount. In 2018 Applicant's sister provided her with $20,000; and in 2019, Applicant\u2019s \nfriend sent her $23,000, and another friend sent her $4,000. Applicant had just purchased \na home in 2018 and opened a small convenience store in 2019. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h - 1.j) All of \nthe money sent to Applicant was money provided to her as an insurance settlement for \nher husband\u2019s death. Applicant\u2019s father was retired and restricted in the amount of money \nhe could send to Applicant without causing problems. Her son testified that others \nstepped in, like her sister and Applicant\u2019s friends, to help with the wire transfers so \nApplicant could purchase the home and the business, which later failed. The remainder \nof the insurance proceeds were used up in late 2019. (Tr. 27-33, 44-48, 59) \nApplicant\u2019s father is a citizen and resident of Iraq.

During her September 2021 background interview, \nApplicant was asked by an investigator if other than her father, did she have any other \nfamily members or foreign contacts to report. Applicant initially stated she did not, but \nthen she mentioned her sister, who is also a citizen and resident of Iraq. (SOR \u00b6 1.c) \nApplicant has contact with her sister on a weekly basis. Her sister is unemployed, and \nApplicant was unsure of her sister\u2019s spouse\u2019s occupation. Applicant reported another \nsister living in Sweden, but she had not had contact with this sister in the last 15 years. \nApplicant also has a brother living in Sweden, unemployed, and in the process of \nobtaining his Swedish citizenship. (SOR \u00b6 1.b) She communicates with him about every \nthree months. (GE 1-3; Tr. 23-24, 48) \nApplicant also disclosed to the investigator that she has a stepsister who is a \ncitizen and resident of Iraq. The stepsister lives with her father and attends high school. \nHer stepmother is a citizen and resident of Iraq, also living with her father. (SOR \u00b6 1.d) \nShe works in elder care, and Applicant does not have much contact with her unless she \nis staying at her father\u2019s home during her trips to Iraq.

Post-hearing \nsubmission of her U.S. passport and a review of the travel stamps therein support \nApplicant\u2019s testimony that she has travelled to Iraq on multiple occasions since August \n2022. (Tr. 26, 50-52, 59; AE A) \nAdministrative Notice \nI have taken administrative notice of the following facts concerning Iraq: \nThe Federal Republic of Iraq (Iraq) is a constitutional parliamentary republic. The \nU.S. Department of State warns U.S. citizens not to travel to Iraq due to terrorism and \narmed conflict. U.S. citizens in Iraq are at high risk for violence and kidnapping. Numerous \nterrorist and insurgent groups are active in Iraq and regularly attack both Iraqi security \nforces and civilians. The Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), a designated terrorist \norganization, remains a threat to public safety in Iraq. Additionally, criminal gangs and \nlocal militia pose a potential threat to U.S. citizens. In February 2022, the U.S. Director of \nNational Intelligence (DNI) concluded that, given the ongoing presence of ISIS and Iraqi \nShia militias, Iraq will likely face a lengthy period of political turmoil and conflict. (AN I) \nIraq\u2019s most significant human rights abuses are largely fueled by the terrorist \nactivities of ISIS; however, some Iraqi security forces were alleged to have engaged in \nunlawful killings, disappearances and extortion, torture, life-threatening conditions in \ndetention and prison facilities, and arbitrary arrest and detention. (AN I) \nThe United States\u2019 commitment to Iraq is balanced against the inherent dangers \nof the ongoing conflict in Iraq to its citizens and residents from terrorists and significant \nhuman rights issues. (AN 1) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 6 as follows: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \nTwo disqualifying conditions under this guideline are relevant to this case: \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 7(a): contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, \nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen \nof or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk \nof foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \nand \nAG \u00b6 7(b): connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country \nthat create a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation \nto protect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology. \n\u201cThe United States has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding \n[sensitive] information from any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to \nhave access to it, regardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests \ninimical to those of the United States.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, \n2004). To establish AG \u00b6 7(a), the Government must demonstrate a \u201cheightened risk\u201d of \nexploitation due to Applicant\u2019s contacts with her family members in Iraq. Given the \npresence and activities of several terrorist organizations hostile to the interests of the \nUnited States in Iraq, the Government has established the requisite \u201cheightened risk\u201d and \npotential conflict of interest regarding Applicant\u2019s contacts with her father, sister, brothers, \nand extended family members in Iraq. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) apply. The Government did \nnot establish a \u201cheightened risk\u201d of exploitation due to Applicant\u2019s sporadic contact with \nher brother and sister in Sweden, her stepmother and stepsister in Iraq, or her friends \ntransferring Applicant\u2019s money from Iraq to the U.S. in 2019. \nThe following mitigating conditions under this guideline are potentially relevant: \nAG \u00b6 8(a): the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country \nin which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed \nin a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the\nUnited States; \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 8(b): there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s \nsense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or \ncountry is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected \nto resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; and \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 8(c): contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNot every foreign contact or tie presents the heightened risk consideration. The \n\u201cheightened risk\u201d denotes a risk greater than the normal risk inherent in having a family \nmember or a spouse\u2019s family member living under a foreign government. The nature and \nstrength of the family ties or other foreign interests and the country involved (i.e., the \nnature of its government, its relationship with the United States, and its human rights \nrecord) are relevant in assessing whether there is a likelihood of vulnerability to \ngovernment coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater \nif the foreign country has an authoritarian government; a family member is associated \nwith, or dependent on, the foreign government; or the country is known to conduct \nintelligence operations against the United States. In considering the nature of the foreign \ngovernment, the administrative judge must take into account any terrorist activity in the \ncountry at issue. See generally ISCR Case No. 02-26130 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 7, 2006). \nTerrorist organizations pose an ongoing and critical threat to U.S. interests in Iraq. \nApplicant\u2019s brothers are employed by the Iraqi Army and Iraqi Police Force. Her brothers \nare in positions directly connected to the Iraqi government and likely to cause a conflict \nof interest. Applicant actively maintains close relationships with her father, sister, \nbrothers, and extended family members in Iraq. She travels to Iraq frequently to visit her \nfamily. \nI considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s ties to Iraq, the nature of its government, its \nrelationship with the United States, and its human rights record, all of which are relevant \nin assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable to \ngovernment coercion. Applicant\u2019s extended family members in Iraq \u201ccould be a means \nthrough which Applicant comes to the attention of those who seek U.S. information or \ntechnology and who would attempt to exert coercion upon [her].\u201d ADP Case No. 14-01655 \nat 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 9, 2015) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-02950 at 3 (App. Bd. May 14, \n2015)). Her relationships with relatives who are living in Iraq create a potential conflict of \ninterest because terrorists could place pressure on her family in an effort to cause \nApplicant to compromise classified information. These relationships create \u201ca heightened \nrisk of foreign inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion\u201d under AG \u00b6 7. Overall, \nthe facts show there is a possibility that Applicant could be placed in a position of having \nto choose between the interests of her foreign family members and the interests of the \nUnited States. When she travels to Iraq, she is available for coercion by malign persons \nor entities. Her ties to the United States are not enough to fully mitigate the risk of undue \nforeign influence. AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a), 8(b), and 8(c) do not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline B and the \nfactors in AG \u00b6 2(d) in this whole-person analysis. \nApplicant has longstanding personal and family connections to Iraq, which given \ncurrent geopolitical circumstances and risks from terrorists presents a heightened risk. \nThe evidence supports that Applicant\u2019s bonds of affection for her family in Iraq are \nongoing, and her brothers are employed in positions that are likely to cause a conflict of \ninterest. Her numerous trips and frequent contacts with family members in Iraq are \nmanifestations of her care and concern for relatives living in that country. Although she \nhas made a new life for herself and her children in the United States, that consideration \nis not sufficient to fully mitigate the risk of undue foreign influence. It is important to make \nclear to the Applicant that security clearance decisions must be made in terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no means be a determination of her loyalty to the United \nStates. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and \ncircumstances in the context of the whole person. Applicant\u2019s connections to Iraq are \nsubstantial and ongoing, and they raise significant security matters. After a careful review \nof the documents and testimony in the record, I conclude foreign influence security \nconcerns are not mitigated. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1.c, 1.e, and 1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b, 1.d, 1.g through 1.j:  \nFor Applicant \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_______________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, I conclude \nthat it is not clearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nPamela C. Benson \nAdministrative Judge \n9 \n",

These delinquencies consist of credit \ncards (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.h) and mortgages (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i and 1.j.).

She claimed that both accounts are held by the same creditor. Both mortgages were \nsecured by a condominium that she owned. The mortgage alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.j was a \n2014 refinance of an earlier mortgage (the First Mortgage). The mortgage alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 1.i was a second mortgage that she opened in about 2006 for a loan amount \nbetween $40,000 and $50,000 (the Second Mortgage). In about 2020, she fell behind \non her required payments on both the First Mortgage and the Second Mortgage \nbecause her employer did not provide her with enough hours to pay her bills. From the \ntime she became delinquent until January 2023, she stayed in consistent contact with \nthe creditor. She attempted to resolve these accounts through a sale and a deed in lieu \nof foreclosure, but her efforts were unsuccessful. In about 2021, the creditor began the \nforeclosure process on the condominium and subsequently sold the property. The sale \nproceeds satisfied the First Mortgage, but not the Second Mortgage. The First Mortgage \nis resolved, but the Second Mortgage is not resolved. She claimed that she contacted \nthe creditor of the Second Mortgage in January 2023, but the creditor wanted more \nmoney than she was able to afford. In her response to the SOR, she claimed that she \nfollowed up with an e-mail to the creditor that same month and was awaiting a \nresponse. She provided no evidence of any subsequent attempts to resolve the Second \nMortgage. (Items 1, 2, 4-10) \nThe primary reason Applicant cited for her financial delinquencies was a \nreduction in her income in 2019 because her employer did not offer her enough hours. \nShe also attributed her financial delinquencies to her husband\u2019s unemployment in \nFebruary 2020, the pandemic, and various other foreseen and unforeseen expenses. \nShe claimed that she moved to a location with a lower cost of living and took an \nunspecified credit-counseling course in January 2023. She claimed that she is trying to \nfind additional work to earn more money, and that it has always been her intention to \nrepay her SOR debts once she has the funds to do so. Despite her claim that she had \ninsufficient funds to address her SOR debts, in July 2021, she paid $19,000 in cash for \na jet ski. She justified this purchase because she had always wanted a jet ski and \nbecause she never bought anything for herself.

(Items 1, 4) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nAt the outset, I find in Applicant\u2019s favor with respect to the allegations in SOR \u00b6 \n1.j, because they were not established. She had several other delinquent consumer \ndebts totaling about $52,000. Many of those established debts have been delinquent for \nyears. The evidence is sufficient to raise AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c), thereby shifting the \nburden to Applicant to provide evidence in mitigation. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nWhile she has resolved or is resolving some of her SOR debts, several of \nApplicant\u2019s financial delinquencies are ongoing. She has not provided a timeline for \nwhen she will resolve them and has not provided sufficient evidence that she has the \nincome to do so. She has not established a track record of financial responsibility. I \ncannot find that her financial issues are unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \nApplicant\u2019s financial issues arose because of underemployment, her husband\u2019s \nunemployment, the pandemic, and unforeseen expenses. These conditions were \nbeyond her control. For AG \u00b6 20(b) to fully apply, she must also show that she acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances with respect to these debts. At first blush, it \nappears that she did. She stayed in contact with her creditors and paid some of the \ndebts as she was able. However, her July 2021 $19,000 cash purchase of a jet ski \nundermines her claim that she has acted responsibly. This purchase also detracts from \nher claim that she had insufficient funds to address her delinquencies. It also \nundermines any claim that she made a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts. Given her choice to spend this significant amount of money on \na luxury item while she had other unresolved delinquencies, I cannot find that she acted \nresponsibly given the circumstances, or that she made a good-faith effort to resolve her \ndebts. I also note that any payments she made on her SOR debts were made after the \nSOR was issued, which reduces the mitigative value. AG \u00b6 20(b) and AG \u00b6 20(d) are \nnot fully applicable. \nWhile Applicant has undergone some credit counseling, because of her \nsignificant unresolved delinquencies and lack of budget information, I cannot find that \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control. AG \u00b6 \n20(c) does not apply. \nOther than the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.j, which I found in Applicant\u2019s favor, she does not \ndispute the other debts. AG\u00b6 20(e) applies to SOR \u00b6 1.j but not to any of the other SOR \ndebts. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNone of the Guideline F mitigating factors are fully applicable. Applicant\u2019s \nfinancial issues continue to cast doubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, and \ngood judgment. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.i: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.j: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nBenjamin R. Dorsey \nAdministrative Judge \n9 \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 31-year-old employee of a defense contractor for whom he has worked since April 2022. He earned a high school diploma in 2010. He took some college courses between 2010 and 2012 but did not earn an undergraduate degree. He has never been married. He has a five-year-old child. (Item 3) Applicant had four delinquent debts totaling approximately $32,000. In the SOR, the Government alleged these delinquent debts.

He earned a high school diploma in 2010. He took some \ncollege courses between 2010 and 2012 but did not earn an undergraduate degree. He \nhas never been married. He has a five-year-old child. (Item 3) \nApplicant had four delinquent debts totaling approximately $32,000. In the SOR, \nthe Government alleged these delinquent debts. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.d) These \ndelinquencies consist of a vehicle loan (SOR \u00b6 1.a), credit cards (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c), \nand a medical bill (SOR \u00b6 1.d). He admitted these allegations. His admissions are \nadopted as findings of fact. Those SOR allegations are established through his \nadmissions and the Government\u2019s credit reports. (Items 2-6) \nDespite being required to do so, Applicant failed to divulge the delinquent debts \nidentified as SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.d on his May 2022 Electronic Questionnaires for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP). He did disclose the delinquent credit cards listed in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c. During his June 2022 security interview, he told the DOD \ninvestigator that he intentionally did not list these debts on his e-QIP because he was \n\u201cembarrassed.\u201d There is no evidence that he volunteered these delinquencies before \nthe DOD investigator confronted him with them. The Government alleged his deliberate \nfailure to list these delinquent debts in SOR \u00b6 2.a. In his response to the SOR, he \nadmitted this allegation. His admission is adopted as a finding of fact. (Items 1-6) \nThe delinquent vehicle loan in the amount of $14,356 alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a is \nbeing resolved. Applicant co-signed on this loan in July 2018, to help a work colleague \npurchase a vehicle. The work colleague failed to make the required payments on the \ncar and defaulted on the account in October 2020. Applicant tried to make payments on \nthe account, but he could not regularly afford to do so. Prior to the Government issuing \nthe SOR, the last payment on this account was in November 2019. On March 28, 2023, \nhe made a $300 payment that he corroborated with a receipt he submitted. He claimed \nthat he has a monthly payment arrangement with the creditor to satisfy this debt. (Items \n1, 2, 4-6; FORM Response) \nThe delinquent credit cards in the amounts of $9,480 and $8,702, alleged in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c, respectively, are being resolved. Applicant opened the account listed in \nSOR \u00b6 1.b in March 2013. The date of last activity on this account prior to the SOR was \nJanuary 2019. On March 24, 2023, he made a payment of $50 on this account. On \nMarch 26, 2023, he made a payment arrangement with the creditor to pay 72 monthly \npayments of $130.97 beginning in April 2023. He opened the credit card in SOR \u00b6 1.c in \nSeptember 2014. The date of last activity on this account prior to the SOR was \nDecember 2018. On March 24, 2023, he made a payment of about $217 on this \naccount. On March 26, 2023, he made a payment arrangement with the creditor to pay \n40 monthly payments of about $217.

(Items 1-6; FORM Response) \nThe medical account in the amount of $172 listed in SOR \u00b6 1.d has been \nresolved. Applicant became delinquent on this account in April 2018. He provided \ndocumentary corroboration that he paid this account on March 24, 2023. (Items 1, 2, 4\u00ad\n6; FORM Response) \nApplicant claimed that he began having financial difficulties in about 2016 \nbecause he assisted his mother financially with her health issues. He also claimed that \nthe issues he had because he co-signed on the car loan listed in SOR \u00b6 1.a kept him \nfrom getting back on track with his finances. He claimed that he has learned from his \nmistake of co-signing for a colleague and will never do so again. He presented no \nevidence to show he has participated in financial counseling or has a working budget. \nHe did not present evidence of his current financial situation, such as his gross monthly \nincome, deductions, monthly expenses, and monthly net remainder. (Items 2-4) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant had four delinquent debts totaling about $32,000. He was delinquent \non these debts for years. The evidence is sufficient to raise AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c), \nthereby shifting the burden to Applicant to provide evidence in mitigation. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n  \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nExcept for the medical debt, which he has paid, Applicant\u2019s financial \ndelinquencies are ongoing. While he recently made one payment on each of the \nremaining SOR debts, without evidence of his current financial situation, I cannot \nassess whether he is still financially overextended. Therefore, I cannot find that his \nfinancial issues are unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \nApplicant\u2019s financial issues arose because of his mother\u2019s health problems. \nThese conditions were beyond his control. His financial issues also arose because he \nmade the decision to co-sign a car loan for his work colleague. This cause was within \nhis control. For AG \u00b6 20(b) to apply, he must also show that he acted responsibly under \nthe circumstances with respect to these debts. He began to make efforts to resolve his \nSOR debts well after the Government issued the SOR. An applicant who begins to \nresolve security concerns only after having been placed on notice that his or her \nclearance or eligibility for a public trust position is in jeopardy may lack the judgment \nand willingness to follow rules and regulations when his or her personal interests are not \nthreatened. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-04110 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 26, 2019). Given \nthe late timing of his resolution attempts, and the lack of evidence of his financial \nstability, he has not provided sufficient evidence that he acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances or that he resolved the debts in good faith. AG \u00b6 20(b) and AG \u00b6 20(d) do \nnot apply. He has not mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes.  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nApplicant deliberately failed to divulge two of the SOR debts on his e-QIP \nbecause he was embarrassed by them. The above disqualifying condition is applicable. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate personal conduct security \nconcerns. The following mitigating conditions potentially apply in Applicant\u2019s case: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior \nis so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \nThere is insufficient evidence that Applicant divulged the debts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a and 1.d prior to being confronted with them. AG \u00b6 17(a) does not apply. \nAG \u00b6 17(c) does not apply to Applicant\u2019s intentional falsification. Falsification of \nan e-QIP is not \u201cminor\u201d because it \u201cstrikes at the heart of the security clearance \nprocess.\u201d ISCR Case No. 09-01652 (App. Bd. Aug. 8, 2011). Moreover, there is \ninsufficient evidence to show that his falsification is unlikely to recur. The personal \nconduct security concerns are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines F and E in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations or personal conduct security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n________________________ \nBenjamin R. Dorsey \nAdministrative Judge \n7 \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact There are 17 allegations in the SOR. The first two are federal tax allegations. SOR \u00b6 1.a alleges a failure to file a federal tax return for tax 2019. SOR \u00b6 1.b alleges a failure to pay taxes for tax year 2012. SOR \u00b6 1.b through 1.q identify sixteen delinquent accounts consisting of one tax account, 12 commercial accounts, and three medical accounts, amounting to $18,765. Applicant successfully disputed two accounts identified at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.p (medical) and SOR \u00b6 1.q (commercial), and they were removed from his credit report. The number of creditors is reduced to 14, and the total amount of delinquent debt is reduced to $17,444, consisting of 11 commercial accounts, two medical accounts, and one tax account. Applicant admitted all allegations in the SOR, but claimed that he disputed a few debts and others no longer appeared in his credit report. SOR \u00b6 1.a alleges that Applicant failed to file a Federal income tax return for 2019. This allegation is based on Applicant\u2019s disclosure in his October 2021 security clearance application that he did not file his 2019 Federal tax return. In his December 2021 PSI, he stated that he planned to file his 2019 return when he filed his 2021 return in 2022. (Item 9 at 6) In his December 2022 answer to the SOR, he claimed that he 2 called the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in December 2022, and was informed that he did not file returns for tax years 2018 and 2020, and not 2019.

Karoian, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n08/22/2023 \nDecision \nMASON, Paul J., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant\u2019s unresolved financial tax issues date to 2012. He has accumulated \n14 commercial and medical debts since April 2019. His unsupported claims of intending \nto settle some debts by the end of December 2022 or January 2023, or to begin \npayment plans in January 2023, are not credible as he has produced no evidence in \nsupport of those claims. He has not mitigated the security concerns raised under the \nguideline for financial considerations. Eligibility for security clearance access is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn October 5, 2021, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP, Item 3) to retain his security clearance required for a \nposition with a defense contractor. On May 13, 2022, he provided a response to \ninterrogatories (Item 5) regarding the status of his delinquent debts and federal tax \nissues. He provided two personal subject interviews (PSIs) to an investigator from the \nOffice of Personnel Management (OPM). These PSIs occurred on March 25, 2019 (Item \n8) and December 10, 2021 (Item 9). The Defense Counterintelligence and Security \nAgency (DCSA) Consolidated Adjudications Services (CAS) could not make the \naffirmative findings required to continue a security clearance, and issued to Applicant a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR), dated December 2, 2022, detailing security concerns \n1 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nraised by financial considerations (Guideline F).

He elected \nto have his case decided on an administrative (written) record instead of a hearing. The \nGovernment sent a copy of the File of Relevant Material (FORM), the Government\u2019s \nevidence in support of the allegations in the SOR, to Applicant on March 15, 2023, by \nexpedited transmission. He received the FORM on the same day. On March 16, 2023, \nhe emailed the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) that he had received \nthe FORM and would be working on a response. A copy of his email is marked and \nadmitted into evidence as Hearing Exhibit (HE) 1. The original email is in the court file in \nthe blue folder. No additional information was received by DOHA ahead of the April 14, \n2023 deadline. \nRulings on Procedure \nOn page two of the FORM, Department Counsel advised Applicant that he \ncould either file objections, furnish explanations, or submit additional material to clarify \nthe information contained in the PSIs or some other evidence included in the FORM. \nAlso, Applicant was advised that he could object to the PSIs because they lacked \nauthentication by a Government witness. As no response was received by DOHA, the \ntwo PSIs and the other seven items in the FORM are entered into the record in their \nentirety. The case file was assigned to me on June 16, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nThere are 17 allegations in the SOR. The first two are federal tax allegations. \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges a failure to file a federal tax return for tax 2019. SOR \u00b6 1.b alleges a \nfailure to pay taxes for tax year 2012. SOR \u00b6 1.b through 1.q identify sixteen delinquent \naccounts consisting of one tax account, 12 commercial accounts, and three medical \naccounts, amounting to $18,765. Applicant successfully disputed two accounts \nidentified at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.p (medical) and SOR \u00b6 1.q (commercial), and they were removed \nfrom his credit report. The number of creditors is reduced to 14, and the total amount of \ndelinquent debt is reduced to $17,444, consisting of 11 commercial accounts, two \nmedical accounts, and one tax account. Applicant admitted all allegations in the SOR, \nbut claimed that he disputed a few debts and others no longer appeared in his credit \nreport. \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges that Applicant failed to file a Federal income tax return for \n2019. This allegation is based on Applicant\u2019s disclosure in his October 2021 security \nclearance application that he did not file his 2019 Federal tax return. In his December \n2021 PSI, he stated that he planned to file his 2019 return when he filed his 2021 return \nin 2022.

In his December 2022 \nanswer to the SOR, he submitted processed federal returns for tax years 2018 and \n2020. He owed $536 for tax year 2018 and $700 for tax year 2020. However, he did not \nproduce documented evidence to confirm that he filed his 2019 Federal tax return. This \nallegation has not been resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleges that Applicant owes delinquent taxes to the IRS for tax year \n2012. In his October 2021 security clearance application, he stated that he owed the \nUnited States (US) Treasury $1,100 for year 2012. (Item 3 at 50) Pursuant to E3.1.17. \nof DOD Directive 5220.6, I am amending this allegation by inserting the dollar amount of \ntaxes that Applicant owes ($1,100) for tax year 2012. He admitted in his May 2022 \ninterrogatory responses that his 2012 Federal taxes were not paid. (Item 5 at 8) He \nexplained in his December 2022 answer to the SOR that he contacted the IRS in \nDecember 2022. The agency informed him to address the SOR \u00b6 1.a missing returns \nfirst, then file Form 9465 for federal tax year 2012. Even though he provided evidence of \nfiling the 2018 and 2020 Federal tax returns, he provided no documentation that he filed \nfederal tax Form 9465, or that he paid the $1,100 in federal taxes for tax year 2012. The \naccount has not been satisfied. \nSOR \u00b6 1.c is a credit account that became delinquent in July 2021. (Item 6 at 5; \nItem 7 at 2) In his December 2022 answer to the SOR, he claimed that he spoke with an \nagent of the collection agency and negotiated a repayment plan to begin on December \n28, 2022, with payments of $240 a month. With no documented proof of payments, i.e., \ncancelled checks, a bank statement or ledger, receipts, or other documented verification \nof payment, the debt is unresolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.d is a delinquent account held by a collection agency for the original \npayday loan creditor. The account became delinquent in January 2022. Applicant \nindicated in his December 2022 answer that the original creditor advised him that the \naccount had been transferred to a collection agency. When he is contacted by the \ncollection agency, he will pay the account. This account has not been paid. \nSOR \u00b6 1.e is a phone account that became delinquent in November 2020. \n(Item 7 at 2) Applicant averred in his December 2022 answer that he entered a \nrepayment agreement calling for payments of $191 a month for four months. Applicant \ndid not indicate when the payment plan was to begin. Due to the fact that no proof has \nbeen provided about when the payment agreement began or to verify payments, this \naccount is unresolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.f represents a delinquent payday loan that was transferred to a \ncollection agency in February 2019. (Item 6 at 5; Item 7 at 2) Applicant claims that he \ncalled the agent and agreed to pay $124 a month for five months. The claims are \nunsupported.

(Item 6 at 6) Applicant informed the OPM investigator in December \n2021 that he withdrew from some courses because he was sent overseas by his \nemployer. He planned to dispute the debt because he did not believe that he should \nhave to reimburse the school the entire cost of the course when he was enrolled for only \na short time. He acknowledged he would pay the debt if his reimbursement request was \ndenied. (Item 9 at 10) In his December 2022 answer to the SOR, he admitted the \nallegation and claimed that he had set up a payment plan to pay $100 a month \nbeginning in January 2023. The lack of documented support for his claim results in a \nfinding against him under the allegation. \nSOR \u00b6 1.h is a shopping credit card allowing the purchaser to pay for items \nover longer periods of time than normally allowed by other credit-card providers. The \naccount became delinquent in December 2021. (Item 7 at 3) Applicant contended in his \nDecember 2022 answer to the SOR that his payment plan required $130 a month \npayments for 6 months. The claim lacks documentary support. \nSOR \u00b6 1.i is a credit-card instrument allowing the debtor more time than other \ncredit-card providers to pay on credit obligations. The account became delinquent in \nDecember 2021. (Item 7 at 3) Without documentation in support, Applicant claimed that \nhe resumed payments on the credit account on December 14, 2022. The account is still \nunresolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.j became delinquent in June 2021. (Item 6 at 7; Item 7 at 3) In his \nDecember 2022 answer to the SOR, Applicant promised to pay the entire balance in \nJanuary 2023. The debt is not paid. \nSOR \u00b6 1k is a commercial account that became delinquent in March 2022. \n(Item 7 at 3) Applicant asserted that he paid this account and it should be removed from \nhis credit report. (December 2022 answer to the SOR) The account remains unpaid. \nSOR \u00b6 1.l is an unidentified unsecured loan that converted to a delinquent \naccount in July 2022. (Item 7 at 4) Applicant intended to pay the account in January \n2023. Without documentation in support of Applicant\u2019s stated intention, the account \nremains unresolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.m is a medical account that became delinquent in November 2021. \n(Item 6 at 3) In his December 2022 answer, he claims that he disputed the account. The \ninformation included in the CBR entry above does not include a notation showing the \naccount was being disputed. The fact that the account may no longer appear in \nApplicant\u2019s credit report does not negate the fact that he still owes the account. In his \nOctober 2021 security clearance application, he recognized the account because he \nstated he had no insurance at the time, and he nevertheless sought to have the account \nremoved from his credit report. (Item 3 at 55) The debt is unresolved. \n4 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.n is a commercial account in which Applicant leased some tires and \nrims. He apparently signed a 24-month lease for the products. After a week of use, he \ntried to return the tires and rims, but the dealer would not rescind the contract. Applicant \ndid not believe he should have to pay for rest of the lease for only one week\u2019s use. In \nhis December 2022 answer to the SOR, he stated he would start a payment plan in \nJanuary 2023 paying $165 a month. No evidence of a payment plan nor payments was \nproduced. \nSOR \u00b6 1.o is a medical account that became delinquent in July 2021. (Item 6 at \n5) In his December 2022 answer, he maintained that he disputed the debt and the debt \nis no longer on his credit report. Applicant did not furnish a credit report establishing his \nclaim.  \nSOR \u00b6 1.p is a medical account that became delinquent in November 2021. \n(Item 6 at 6) In his response to interrogatories dated May 13, 2022, Applicant indicated \nno action had been taken on this debt, thereby acknowledging the debt was his \nresponsibility. In his December 2022 answer to the SOR, Applicant claimed that he \ndisputed the debt and it was no longer on his credit report. The 2021 credit report \nreflects that he did dispute the debt (Item 6 at 6) and it does not appear in the \nGovernment\u2019s 2022 credit report. (Item 7) The account is resolved in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nSOR \u00b6 1.q is a credit account currently in collection. The account became\ndelinquent in October 2021. (Item 6 at 6) The 2022 credit report indicates that the \nbalance on the account was zero following Applicant\u2019s dispute of the account. (Item 7 at \n4) The account is resolved in Applicant\u2019s favor.  \n \nIn his March 2019 PSI, Applicant recalled enrolling in a debt consolidation \nprogram in the same month. He recollected that he included four debts in the program. \n(Item 8 at 11) Subsequently, he noted his participation in another debt consolidation \nprogram for an undisclosed period of time. He has never had financial counseling. His \nMay 2022 personal financial statement (PFS) indicates that his monthly expenses \nexceed his monthly income by $22. (Item 3 at 49; Item 5 at 11; Item 9 at 11) \nApplicant\u2019s opined that his financial difficulties were caused after his wife was \nunable continue working about seven years ago. He remembered making poor financial \ndecisions in the past, but his decisions regarding how he spends his money have \nimproved. He recalled that in the past he was earning a larger salary and was able to \npay his bills in a timely manner. He considers that he has the professionalism and \nintegrity to faithfully execute all aspects of his job. His employer will readily support his \nconsistently superlative work record. (Item 5 at 10) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines.

Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . ..\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security decision. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18. Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, \nmental health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or \ndependence. An individual who is financially overextended is at greater \nrisk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to \ngenerate funds. Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of \nincome is also a security concern insofar as it may result from criminal \nactivity, including espionage. \nAG \u00b6 19. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying include: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local tax as \nrequired. \n6 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAdverse evidence from credit reports can usually meet the Government\u2019s \nobligation of proving delinquent debts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-02403 at 3 (App. \nBd. Aug. 18, 2015); ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) The two \nGovernment credit reports (GE 6 and GE 7) establish that all debts listed in the SOR \nchanged to a delinquent status between February 2019 and July 2022. Applicant should \nhave understood when he provided his March 2019 PSI and his October 2021 security \napplication that his delinquent debts concerned the Government. When Applicant \nreceived the interrogatories in May 2022, he should have realized the seriousness of his \nfinancial problems, and the importance of instituting corrective action as soon as \npossible. In sum, Applicant was placed on official notice that his delinquent debts and \nfederal tax issues posed security concerns. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply. AG \u00b6 19(b) \napplies because of Applicant\u2019s lack of documented action in addressing 13 of the \nremaining 14 delinquent accounts listed in the SOR. AG \u00b6 19(f) applies based on the \nlack of documentary evidence showing that Applicant filed the federal tax return for \n2019 (SOR \u00b6 1.a), and that he failed to pay $1,100 in federal taxes for 2012. (SOR \u00b6 \n1.b) \nAG \u00b6 20. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n7 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant was unemployed from October 2016 to May 2017; about the same \ntime, he learned his wife could no longer work. However, he has been steadily \nemployed since that period. Though he asserts he has been making more responsible \ndecisions in the last few years, the credit bureau reports show that he has accrued 14 \ndelinquent debts between 2019 and July 2022. His PFS in May 2022 indicates that his \nmonthly expenses exceed his monthly income by $22. Using payday loans to bridge the \ngap between paychecks are poor examples of improved financial decisions. Allowing \npayday loans to become delinquent, exposing the debtor to exorbitant interest rates, \ndemonstrates poor judgment. There is insufficient evidence to find that Applicant acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) extends mitigation where an applicant has had financial counseling, \nand there are encouraging signs that his financial problems are being resolved or under \ncontrol. While Applicant indicated that he participated in two debt consolidation plans, \nthere is no evidence of the outcome of either consolidation plan. He admitted that he \nnever had financial counseling. Applicant presented no evidence of a budget or other \nmethod of how he manages his finances. AG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply because Applicant is not engaged in a good-faith \neffort to repay 13 creditors or collection agencies. He receives negligible mitigation \nunder AG \u00b6 20(e) for successfully disputing and removing the medical account in SOR \u00b6 \n1.p and the credit account in SOR \u00b6 1q. SOR \u00b6 20(g) does not apply because of the \nmissing 2019 federal tax return and Applicant\u2019s failure to pay the delinquent federal \ntaxes for 2012.

His \nwife managed to obtain assistance to flip the UTV back onto four wheels and free up \nthe arm. The 911 dispatcher indicated that the winds in the area were too strong to get \na helicopter to Applicant, so a paramedic ambulance was sent to get him to the highway \nwhere a helicopter met them and took Applicant to a hospital where he remained for \nover one month undergoing multiple surgeries, skin grafts, and blood transfusions. (Item \n3 at 33-34; Item 2 at 1; Item 6 at 5; Response to FORM at 1) \nAdding to the situation was that Applicant was supposed to end his employment \nprobation period and become a permanent employee on February 10, 2021, but instead \nof following up on that plan, the employer laid off several employees including \nApplicant, effectively cancelling his medical insurance. His time in the hospital, his one \nworking arm, and eventual physical therapy left him jobless from February through \nNovember 2021. He was on unemployment during that period, receiving between $300 \nto $600 per week. Applicant eventually received a bill, and he called the creditor in an \nattempt to enroll in a payment plan. The creditor offered him only two options: pay the \nentire debt in full or make monthly payments of $1,000. Applicant was unable to commit \nhimself to making the $1,000 payments, and the creditor refused to negotiate any \nfurther options. (Item 2 at 1; Item 3 at 11, 43-44; Item 6 at 7) \nCOVID-19 had previously caused Applicant and his then-fianc\u00e9 to be laid off in \nearly 2020. He managed to obtain a job in December 2020, only to lose it in February \n2021. Her job difficulties left her with low hours, so she eventually obtained another job \nwith guaranteed hours starting in April 2023. (Response to FORM at 1-2) \nWhile not alleged in the SOR, Department Counsel argued that Applicant also \nhad several other accounts that were either currently delinquent or had been \ndelinquent. Applicant discussed some of those accounts with the OPM investigator and \nindicated the issue arose when his unemployment checks failed to be issued in a timely \nfashion because of a revised process, and his initial employment salary checks took \nextra time to be issued by mail. (Item 6 at 7) As a result of the security clearance \neligibility process, in February 2023, Applicant engaged the professional services of a \ndebt resolution company to assist him resolving those smaller unalleged debts. The \nlarge medical debt is not being handled under the agreement. He currently makes by-\nweekly payments to the company totaling $250 per month.

(Personal Cashflow Statement attached to Response to FORM) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.) \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \neligibility for access to classified information. \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines \nare applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind \nmight accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the \nrecord.\u201d  (ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.32.1)). \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a \npreponderance.\u201d (See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  \nCir. 1994).) \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \n4 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as \nwell. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to \nrepose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants \naccess to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nFurthermore, \u201csecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of \ndenials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).) \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no \nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7) Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have \nbased this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to \nApplicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has \nor has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those \nconclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the \nrecord. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness \nto abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Financial distress can also be caused or exacerbated \nby, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of personnel security \nconcern such as excessive gambling, mental health conditions, substance \nmisuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. Affluence that cannot be explained by \nknown sources of income is also a security concern insofar as it may result \nfrom criminal activity, including espionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19: \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \nThe SOR alleged one delinquent debt totaling approximately $58,835 which \narose from a UTV accident in which Applicant rolled the UTV, crushing and pinning his \narm. A paramedic ambulance was sent to get him to the highway where a helicopter \nflight met them and took Applicant to a hospital where he remained for over one month \nundergoing multiple surgeries, skin grafts, and blood transfusions. His time in the \nhospital, his one working arm, and eventual physical therapy left him jobless from \nFebruary through November 2021. He was on unemployment during that period. \nApplicant eventually received a bill and he called the creditor in an attempt to enroll in a \npayment plan. The creditor offered him only two options: pay the entire debt in full or \nmake monthly payments of $1,000. Applicant was unable to commit himself to making \nthe $1,000 payments, and the creditor refused to negotiate any further options. \nCOVID-19-affiliated layoffs for both Applicant and his wife impacted both of them \nfinancially in early 2020. He managed to obtain a job in December 2020, only to lose it \nin February 2021 just before the accident. Her job difficulties left her with low hours, so \nshe eventually obtained another job with guaranteed hours starting in April 2023. \nNevertheless, despite the current presence of that one substantial medical debt, \nApplicant\u2019s eventual and current inability to satisfy that debt given the two options by the \ncreditor, does not support the establishment of a history of not meeting financial \nobligations under AG \u00b6 19(c), but does establish an inability to satisfy debts under AG \u00b6 \n19(a). There is no evidence to support the establishment of any unwillingness to satisfy \ndebts regardless of the ability to do so under AG \u00b6 19(b). \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties under AG \u00b6 20: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) apply. As noted above, Applicant attributed \nhis current financial situation to several factors: his February 2021 UTV accident; his \nhealth struggles for the remainder of that year undergoing multiple surgeries, skin \ngrafts, blood transfusions, and physical therapy; and his unexpected layoff by his \nemployer leaving him without health insurance \u2013 situations that were largely beyond his \ncontrol. He was on unemployment insurance for a substantial period. Applicant \neventually received a bill from the creditor, and he called the creditor in an attempt to \nenroll in a payment plan. The creditor offered him only two options: pay the entire debt \nin full or make monthly payments of $1,000. Applicant was unable to commit himself to \nmaking the $1,000 payments, and the creditor refused to negotiate any further options. \nApplicant\u2019s financial situation was not helped by his, or his wife\u2019s, COVID-19\u00ad\nrelated employment difficulties that arose before and after the accident. He evaluated \nhis financial situation and decided to trade in his wife\u2019s high-interest rate (18%) \nautomobile for a much lower interest rate (4%) vehicle. He also arrived at a point where \nhe sought assistance to address his newer non-SOR related delinquent accounts. In \ndoing so, he obtained financial counseling, debt relief, and credit repair services, and \ninitiated a good-faith effort to repay several of those overdue creditors and is currently \npaying the debt relief company $250 per month to resolve those accounts. Because of \nthe medical-creditors refusal to offer Applicant a more reasonable repayment option, \nthat substantial medical-related account is simply awaiting a decision with an attorney. \n(Response to FORM at 1-2) \nA debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent \nbecause \u201can applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct \nand, therefore, can be viewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating \nconditions.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case \nNo. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). Between the date Applicant first learned \nof his delinquent medical-related account to the date he was interviewed by the OPM \ninvestigator in March 2022, and the date his response to the FORM was submitted in \nMay 2023, he made verifiable efforts to address the non-SOR related delinquent debts, \nbut still has not achieved any success in resolving the medical debt alleged in the SOR. \nUnalleged conduct can be considered for certain purposes, as discussed by the \nDOHA Appeal Board. (Conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered: (a) to assess \nan applicant's credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant's evidence of extenuation, \nmitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether an applicant has \ndemonstrated successful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular provision of \nthe Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole-person \nanalysis under Directive \u00a7 6.3.).

However, Applicant\u2019s \nresolution efforts in addressing them will be considered only for the five purposes listed \nabove. \nBased on the evidence, it appears that Applicant has repeatedly unsuccessfully \nattempted to negotiate a reasonable repayment option with the medical-account creditor \nfor a multi-year period. At some point, he should either be able to acquire sufficient \nfunds to make reasonable monthly payments under one of the options offered him or he \nmay have to follow legal advice to file for bankruptcy protection and make court-\napproved payments. The overwhelming evidence leads to the conclusion that his \nfinancial problems are, except for the medical account, under control and that he is truly \ninterested in resolving them. His actions indicate that he has acted responsibly. The \nAppeal Board has previously commented on such a situation: \nEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due \nto circumstances outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider \nwhether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when dealing \nwith those financial difficulties. ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. \nJan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); \nISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-\n13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether he or she \nmaintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial \npayments to keep debts current. \nAn applicant who begins to resolve his or her financial problems only after being \nplaced on notice that his or her security clearance is in jeopardy may be lacking in the \njudgment and self-discipline to follow rules and regulations over time or when there is \nno immediate threat to his or her own interests. (See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01213 at \n5 (App. Bd. Jun. 29, 2018); ISCR Case No. 17-00569 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Sept. 18, 2018)) \nIn this instance, Applicant has clearly stated an intention to address his one delinquent \nSOR-related account and he is hoping either for a more reasonable repayment option \nor he may have to seek the assistance of the bankruptcy court. His actions regarding \nhis non-SOR-related accounts indicate reasonable efforts to resolve his financial issues. \nClearance decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines do not \nrequire an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the SOR. \nAn applicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take \nsignificant actions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant \nimmediately resolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, \nnor is there a requirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. \nRather, a reasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of \nsuch debts, or resolution of such issues, one at a time. Mere promises to pay debts in \nthe future, without further confirmed action, are insufficient. In this instance, Applicant \nhas taken specific verifiable actions regarding the non-SOR-related accounts and \ndiscussed specific options left to him regarding the one alleged delinquent account. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nThe Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition], an \napplicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the \napplicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not define the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d \nHowever, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith \u201crequires a \nshowing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, \nhonesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d  \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, \n2004) (quoting ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Jun. 4, 2001)). \nThere is clear evidence that while Applicant has a small monthly remainder \navailable for savings or spending, he is making payments through his credit relief agent \nto the creditors of non-SOR-related delinquent accounts. Action regarding the \nsubstantial SOR-alleged medical account is awaiting a legal decision regarding possible \nbankruptcy with court-approved payments or a more reasonable payment option from \nthe creditor. Applicant\u2019s position, under the circumstances, no longer casts doubt on his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. See ISCR Case No. 09-08533 at \n3-4 (App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2010). \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at \nthe time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. See U.S. v.

In addition, Applicant also has several rather insignificant delinquent \naccounts that the government chose not to include in the SOR. \nThe mitigating evidence under the whole-person concept is simply more \nsubstantial and compelling. Applicant is a 29-year-old employee of a defense contractor. \nHe has been serving as an electronic technician since January 2022. He previously \nworked for other employers in a variety of positions as a heavy equipment operator; a \ndata center technician; and network technician; as well as several short-term positions \nthat were generally less than 12 months each. He was unemployed during several \nperiods in 2012, 2013, 2015, 2020, and 2021. He was unexpectedly laid off by his \nemployer several days before his accident. Following his UTV accident Applicant was \ntaken to a hospital where he remained for over one month undergoing multiple \nsurgeries, skin grafts, and blood transfusions. His time in the hospital, his one working \narm, and eventual physical therapy left him jobless from February through November \n2021. \nUpon receiving his bill, he called the creditor and was offered only two options: \npay the entire debt in full or make monthly payments of $1,000. Applicant was unable to \ncommit himself to making the $1,000 payments, and the creditor refused to negotiate \nany further options. Applicant was on unemployment during that period. Regarding his \nnon-SOR-related accounts, he obtained financial counseling, debt relief, and credit \nrepair services, and initiated a good-faith effort to repay several of those overdue \ncreditors and is currently paying the debt relief company $250 per month to resolve \nthose accounts. The SOR-related account is awaiting a decision as to whether \nApplicant should file for bankruptcy protection. He is a 2012 high school graduate. He \nwas married in 2022. He has one child born in 2022. \nIn ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008), the Appeal Board \naddressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in financial cases stating: \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d necessarily includes evidence of actual \ndebt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not \nrequired, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off each \nand every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he [or she] has \u201c. . . established a plan to resolve his [or \nher] financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d \nThe Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the extent to which that \napplicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible \nand realistic. See Directive \u00b6 E2.2(a) (\u201cAvailable, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be \n10 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                        \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u201d) There is no requirement that a plan \nprovide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a \nreasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of \nsuch debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first \ndebts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones \nlisted in the SOR. \nApplicant\u2019s track record of seeking assistance and entering into a repayment \nagreement regarding the unalleged accounts and his \u2013 to date, unsuccessful \u2013 efforts to \n \n \nresolve the one alleged medical account is positive and hopeful. Overall, the evidence \nleaves me without substantial questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance. Moreover, considering the government\u2019s ongoing \nreview of Applicant\u2019s financial situation under a Continuous Evaluation Program, if he \nfails to make more timely and successful efforts at resolving the alleged medical \naccount, that issue will be highlighted in the future. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial considerations. \nSee SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) (1) through AG 2(d) (9). \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a.:  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nROBERT ROBINSON GALES \nAdministrative Judge \n11 \n",

His exhibits were admitted without objection. DOHA received \nthe transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on April 19, 2023. (Tr. at 12-14.) \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 33 years old. He married in March 2020. His wife passed away \nunexpectedly in March 2022, leaving him a widower with an 18-month-old child. Applicant \nearned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2012 and a master\u2019s degree in 2017. He has worked for a \nfederal contractor since 2014 and is now a manager. He applied for a security clearance \nin November 2014 (2014 e-QIP), and the CAF granted him national security eligibility in \nJanuary 2015.

Specifically, the SOR alleged that \nApplicant used marijuana with varying frequency from about June 2012 through March \n2022 (SOR \u00b6 1.a). The CAF also alleged in subparagraph 1.a that Applicant used \nmarijuana after he had been granted a security clearance. In his Answer, Applicant \nadmitted the allegation under this guideline. (Answer at 1.) \nIn his 2022 e-QIP, Applicant disclosed that he used marijuana \u201cvery sparingly\u201d in \nthe past seven years. He wrote that he used marijuana during that period about five times. \nHe disclosed further that his most recent use (two or three of about five times) was in \nMarch 2022 after his wife died suddenly on March 1, 2022. He used the marijuana to help \nhim sleep at a time of extreme stress. (GE 1 at 33-34.) \nApplicant testified that he had first experimented with marijuana one or two times \nduring the period after college and before he began working for his current employer \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(2012 to 2014). He smoked marijuana with friends who shared their marijuana with him. \nHe also smoked marijuana during the period 2015 to early 2022, while he held a security \nclearance. He does not recall the specifics of these occasions because it was a number \nof years ago when he was younger, but he is certain that his use of marijuana was very \nlimited during that period before his wife died. His best estimate is that he used marijuana \none or two times during that period. (Tr. at 21-23, 25-27.) \nApplicant explained that the cause of his wife\u2019s death was the result of taking a \nmedication that she thought was a prescription medication. He experienced significant \ntrauma from this loss and the new reality that he was the widowed father of a young child \nand responsible for both his child and a demanding full-time job. He had difficulty sleeping. \nHe tried non-prescription sleep aids, but they did not help him, and they had side effects \nthat were difficult for him to handle. On two or three occasions he smoked marijuana \nbefore trying to sleep. He purchased the marijuana legally under the laws of his state of \nresidence (State A). The marijuana gave him some needed rest. (Tr. at 24-30.) \nApplicant quickly decided, however, that he did not want to continue to use \nmarijuana for this purpose because he knew that its use was inconsistent with his \nresponsibilities as someone with access to classified information. He concluded that using \nmarijuana was a mistake. He did not want to have his use of marijuana \u201cspiral\u201d into \nconstant use to self-medicate his stress and grief. Because of the circumstances of his \nwife\u2019s death, he had no interest in taking any prescription medication to help with his \nsleep. He forced himself to find non-drug remedies for his stress in the form of meditation, \ntherapy, breathing exercises, physical exercise, eating better, and time with his child. He \nused these techniques to calm his mind so he could function during the day and sleep at \nnight. He described his path towards emotional recovery as an effort to better himself. He \ntestified that he has no intention to use marijuana or any illegal drug in the future because \nhe wants to strive to better himself and to set a proper example for his child. (Tr. at 28\u00ad\n32.) \nApplicant has not used any marijuana or other illegal form of drugs since his brief \nexperience immediately after his wife\u2019s death. After the hearing, he provided a written \nstatement in which he wrote that he has no intention to use illegal drugs in the future and \nacknowledged that that usage of illegal drugs would constitute a basis for the automatic \nrevocation of his security clearance. He no longer associates with anyone who uses illegal \ndrugs. (Tr. at 31-32; AE A.) \nParagraph 2 - Guideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe Government alleged in this paragraph of the SOR that Applicant is ineligible \nfor clearance because he has engaged in conduct that involves questionable judgment, \nan unwillingness to follow rules and regulations, lack of candor, and dishonesty. The CAF \nalleged that Applicant falsified his answers to the question in Section 23 of the 2014 e-\nQIP about prior illegal drug use. (SOR \u00b6 2.a.) The SOR also cross-alleged under this \nguideline the Guideline H allegations described above.

Accordingly, I regard his lack of \nresponse to the allegation in SOR \u00b6 2.a as a denial of the allegation. (Answer at 2.) \nAt the hearing, Applicant admitted that he deliberately provided a false answer to \nthe question in Section 23 of the 2014 e-QIP. He testified that he was scared at the time \nto admit his prior limited use of marijuana because it could make him ineligible to work for \nthe Government contractor that had offered him his first serious job after his completion \nof college. He was 24 years old. (Tr. at 23-24.) \nApplicant explained that when he prepared his 2022 e-QIP, he knew that he had \nmade a serious mistake in failing to disclose his drug use prior to November 2014 in his \n2014 e-QIP. He decided that he should fully disclose his past use of marijuana, including \nhis post-college drug use and his recent use of marijuana after the death of his wife about \nthree months earlier. He reasoned that he had matured since 2014 when he was very \nyoung and that working at a DoD contractor had taught him the importance of personal \nintegrity. He also believes that being fully candid with the Government was an important \nstep in his healing process following the loss of his wife. He is determined \u201cto better \nhimself\u201d so that he is the best person he can be. He decided he needed to accept the \nconsequences of his past mistakes using marijuana and not disclosing his prior use in his \n2014 e-QIP. (Tr. at 32-33, 36, 41.) \nApplicant understands that the purpose of his 2022 e-QIP is to seek eligibility for \na Top Secret clearance. He fully appreciates the responsibilities that such eligibility \ncarries with it and the level of personal integrity that accompanies such a clearance. He \nintends to live a healthy and honest lifestyle going forward. He is proud of his hard work \nthroughout his college years and post-graduate education. He has been successful \nworking at his employer since 2014 and has been rewarded with several promotions. He \nhopes to continue his stellar career working for a DoD contractor. (Tr. at 32-33, 36, 41.) \nMitigation and Whole-Person Evidence \nAfter the hearing, Applicant submitted his performance evaluations since 2017. He \nhas been rated in each year as a \u201cexcellent performer\u201d or a \u201csuccessful performer. He \nhas earned promotions since his first year at the company in 2014 with increasing levels \nof responsibility. (AE B \u2013 AE H, AE N.) Applicant also submitted four character reference \nletters from work colleagues, including a former supervisor, and a neighbor. They all \npraise Applicant\u2019s dedication to his work and his reliable and trustworthy character. (AE I \nthrough AE L.) \nIn a written statement submitted after the hearing, Applicant wrote that he does not \nintend to use marijuana in the future and acknowledges that any such use would be \ngrounds for the revocation of his national security eligibility. He also wrote that he has \nvolunteered to receive random drug testing by his employer.

He was traumatized. He has since \nworked hard to rebuild his life and commit himself to living a healthy, drug-free lifestyle. \nHe believes that his therapy, his stress-reducing exercises, and time with his young child \nhave all dramatically improved his life since the low point he experienced in March 2022. \n(AE O.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions in his Answer and his detailed testimony regarding his \nhistory of substance misuse establish the above potentially disqualifying conditions.

Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nAG \u00b6 25 describes the following two conditions that raise security concerns and \nmay potentially be disqualifying in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nThe guideline includes two conditions in AG \u00b6 26 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s alleged drug involvement and substance misuse: \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome the problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of \nnational security eligibility. \nIn my analysis, I have taken administrative notice of the Security Executive Agent\u2019s \n(SecEA) \u201cClarifying Guidance Concerning Marijuana for Individuals Eligible to Access \nClassified Information or Eligible to Hold a Sensitive Position,\u201d dated December 21, 2021. \n(Guidance.) In her Guidance, the SecEA noted the increased number of states that have \nlegalized or decriminalized the use of marijuana (including State A) and issued the \nGuidance to \u201cprovide clarifying guidance.\u201d She reaffirmed SecEA\u2019s 2014 memorandum \nregarding the importance of compliance with Federal law on the illegality of the use of \nmarijuana by holders of security clearances. She provided further clarification of Federal \nmarijuana policy, writing that this policy remains relevant to security clearance \nadjudications \u201cbut [is] not determinative.\u201d She noted that the adjudicative guidelines \nprovided various opportunities for a clearance applicant to mitigate security concerns \nraised by his or her past use of marijuana. \nApplicant\u2019s use of marijuana in or prior to 2014 was long ago when he was quite \nyoung, was experimental, and was very infrequent. His more recent use after 2015 and \nprior to March 2022 was also infrequent and is primarily a security concern because he \nhad been granted a security clearance in January 2015 before that use occurred. All of \nhis drug use was self-reported in his 2022 e-QIP. His use of marijuana immediately after \nthe death of his wife was limited to two or three nights. He used marijuana to help calm \nhis stress and permit him to sleep under extraordinary and tragic circumstances. \nApplicant credibly testified that after two or three nights of using marijuana for this \npurpose, he changed his mind, and committed to himself that he would never use \nmarijuana or any other illegal drug again because he knew it was wrong to do so. He \nfurther committed to himself that he would face this extreme adversity with maturity. He \nresolved to be a better person. He refused to let his tragedy be an excuse for his life to \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n\u201cspiral\u201d down. He knew he could not afford to do that because he had a young child to \nraise by himself. \nApplicant has acknowledged his mistakes and has taken steps to overcome the \nstress in his life in a responsible manner. He has established a year of abstinence and \nhas signed a statement of his intent to never use illegal drugs again with an \nacknowledgment that any future involvement or misuse of illegal drugs would be grounds \nfor the revocation of his security clearance eligibility. In addition, he no longer associates \nwith drug users. Under all of the above circumstances, Applicant\u2019s past behavior does not \ncast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. Both of the above \nmitigating conditions are fully established. Paragraph 1 of the SOR is found for Applicant. \nParagraph 2 - Guideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for personal conduct are set out in \nAG \u00b6 15, which states: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes the following two conditions that raise security concerns and \nmay potentially be disqualifying in this case. \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information. \nApplicant admitted that he deliberately provided a false answer in his 2014 e-QIP \nregarding his past illegal drug use. AG \u00b6 16(a) is established and shifts the burden to \nApplicant to mitigate the security concerns raised by his conduct.

However, the record evidence as a whole does not support an adverse \nwhole-person assessment for the reason set for the below in the analysis of the whole-\nperson concept. Accordingly, the security concerns arising under AG \u00b6 16(c) are not fully \nestablished. \nThe guideline includes two conditions in AG \u00b6 17 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s falsification in the 2014 e-QIP and his use of marijuana \nwhile holding a security clearance: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, of falsification before being confronted with the facts; and \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \nApplicant\u2019s falsification in the 2014 e-QIP is mitigated because so much time has \npassed, and the behavior was so infrequent. Moreover, he has learned from his past \nmistakes and self-disclosed in the 2022 e-QIP the facts underlying his falsification in \n2014, i.e., that he had experimented with marijuana on one or two occasions in the first \nyear or two after he graduated from college. While the explicit terms of AG \u00b6 17(a) do not \napply to the facts of this case, the mitigating concept of voluntary self-disclosure has some \napplication here. With his complete candor in his 2022 e-QIP and his credible testimony \nat the hearing, Applicant has established that his past behavior is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. AG \u00b6 17(c) has \nbeen fully established in mitigation with respect to Applicant\u2019s falsification in his 2014 e-\nQIP. \nApplicant has also established mitigation under AG \u00b6 17(c) with respect to the \nsecurity concerns raised by his use of marijuana while holding a security clearance. His \nillegal drug use after he was granted a security clearance and prior to his wife\u2019s death \nwas limited to one or two occasions. While any illegal drug use with a security clearance \nis concerning, the infrequent nature of this behavior reduces that concern, as does the \nunique circumstances of his use after his wife\u2019s sudden death. Also, the record evidence \nsupports that conclusion that the limited times Applicant used marijuana after being \ngranted a security clearance in 2015 occurred a number of years ago, with the exception \nof the substance misuse immediately after the death of Applicant\u2019s wife. The \ncircumstances of that recent use of marijuana are so highly unusually and extraordinarily \nsympathetic, that I cannot conclude that his actions in any way represent the person he \nis today. His limited use of marijuana for what can best be described as \u201cmedicinal \npurposes\u201d after his wife\u2019s death does not cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or judgment.

The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case and the whole-person factors \nquoted above. I have also weighed the recent guidance of the SecEA with respect to the \nimportance of mitigating evidence in a Guideline H case, such as this. Applicant has \nprovided sufficient evidence to mitigate the security concerns under Guidelines H and E \nraised by his use of marijuana while holding a security clearance, and by the Guideline E \nconcerns regarding falsification. Overall, the record evidence does not raise any \nquestions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s present suitability for national security eligibility and \na security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a and 2.b: \nFor Applicant \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n                                                \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national security \neligibility for a security clearance.

There were no objections by Applicant; Items 1 through 6 are admitted into \nevidence. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 47 years old. He has been employed as a manufacturing planner for \na defense contractor since May 2022. He worked in various positions for six other \nemployers from January 2017 until May 2022. He was unemployed from May 2018 to \nDecember 2018, March 2019 to October 2019, and January 2020 to February 2020. He \nreceived credit counseling in February 2015. (Items 2, 3, 4 at 26) \nApplicant attended college from September 2008 to November 2010 and earned \nan associate degree in 2010. He married in November 2001 and divorced in May 2005. \nHe has two adult children (ages 23 and 20). (Items 2, 3)  \nThe SOR alleges 28 delinquent debts, totaling approximately $88,500, including \n16 delinquent student loans totaling $81,488 and a Chapter 7 Bankruptcy. Applicant \nadmitted all SOR allegations, with explanation. (Item 1 at 1-5) \nApplicant attributed his financial difficulties to his 2005 divorce, being a single \nparent of two children, unemployment, and costs associated with his mother\u2019s care after \nshe became ill in 2019, including medical and funeral costs. (Item 3 at 2) \nThe evidence concerning debts alleged in the SOR is summarized below. \nSOR \u00b6 1.a: Chapter 7 Bankruptcy filed and discharged in 2015. Applicant \nadmitted the allegation. (Item 1) He filed for bankruptcy in February 2015 and was granted \ndischarge in May 2015. (Item 4 at 1, 3, 27; Item 5 at 2) Bankruptcy records show $68,270 \nin total non-priority unsecured debt and that his student loan obligations were not \ndischarged. (Item 4 at 12-13, 18-19, 28) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b-1.q: student loans placed for collection totaling approximately \n$81,488. Applicant admitted each allegation noting that the debts \u201cha[ve] not been \nresolved.\u201d (Item 1 at 1-3) He told a government investigator that he incurred the loans \nwhile he attended college from 2008 to 2010. He acknowledged that he had not made \nany payments on the loans and that he had no real reason for failing to do so. He also \nsaid that he contacted the creditor in 2014 and set up a repayment plan with monthly \npayments of $50 but did not follow through with payments. He noted that the loans had \nbeen in forbearance since 2020 because of COVID-19 relief and stated his intent to \nestablish a repayment plan when that relief ends. (Item 3 at 3-4) Credit reports from May \n2022 and February 2023 show each student loan account as placed for collection.

(Item 5 at 9-10) \nPolicies \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not inflexible \nrules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines \nare applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n\u201cThe applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, \nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department \nCounsel, and has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance \ndecision.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988); see AG \u00b6 2(b). \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. Under AG \n\u00b6 2(b), any doubt will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be \na determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence in the FORM establish a history of \nfinancial problems. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply. \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. Five potentially \napply in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nApplicant has a long history of financial problems. In 2015, he had a substantial \namount of delinquent debt discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy, but his delinquent student \nloans were not discharged (SOR \u00b6 1.a). The SOR alleges 28 delinquent debts, totaling \napproximately $88,500, including 16 delinquent student loans totaling $81,488. He has \nsettled two SOR debts totaling $1,232 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.v-1.w) and entered a payment \nagreement to resolve a third debt (SOR \u00b6 1.t). I also found for Applicant on SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.aa-\n1.bb, because both debts had been transferred or sold with no balance due.  \nApplicant admitted that he has not made a single payment on the student loan \ndebt alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.q, which he incurred from 2008 to 2010, and that now totals \n$81,488. He acknowledged that the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.r, 1.s, 1u, 1.y, and 1.z had \nnot been resolved and stated his intent to attempt to resolve them. He has not submitted \ndocumentary evidence of payment on or efforts to resolve these debts. Intentions to \nresolve financial problems in the future are not a substitute for a track record of debt \nrepayment or other responsible approaches. See ISCR Case No. 11-14570 at 3 (App. \nBd. Oct. 23, 2013). \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s remaining delinquent debts are long\u00ad\nstanding, ongoing, and were not incurred under circumstances making them unlikely to \nrecur. The fact that he incurred additional delinquent debt after a bankruptcy discharge of \nmore than $68,000 in unsecured debt suggests that the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence of his financial problems remains unacceptably high. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not fully established. Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties following his \n2005 divorce and being a single parent of two children, unemployment, and costs \nassociated with his mother\u2019s care and funeral were conditions largely beyond his control. \nHowever, he has not provided sufficient evidence that he acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is not established because Applicant submitted no evidence of \nfinancial counseling. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is not fully established. He has settled the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.v-1.w totaling $1,232, and has entered into, and apparently complied with a payment \nagreement to resolve the $824 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.t.

Applicant admitted the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.x \nand said he intended to dispute the erroneous service charge, but he has provided no \nevidence that he disputed the charge or to substantiate the basis for a dispute, and has \nnot provided evidence of actions he has taken to resolve the issue. \nApplicant bears the burdens of production and persuasion in mitigation. He is not \nheld to a standard of perfection in his debt-resolution efforts or required to be debt-free. \n\u201cRather, all that is required is that an applicant act responsibly given his circumstances \nand develop a reasonable plan for repayment, accompanied by \u2018concomitant conduct,\u2019 \nthat is, actions which evidence a serious intent to effectuate the plan.\u201d ISCR Case No. \n15-02903 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 9, 2017). See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 13-00987 at 3, n. 5 \n(App. Bd. Aug. 14, 2014). Applicant has not met his burden. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. I considered Applicant\u2019s age, education and \nemployment history; that his financial problems were caused, in part, by circumstances \nbeyond his control, and that he has acted responsibly regarding some of his debts. \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nnot mitigated the security concerns raised by his delinquent debts. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.s, 1.u, \n1x-1.z: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.t, 1.v-1.w, \n1.aa-1.bb:  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

(Response at pages 6 and 11~12.) This allegation is found \nfor Applicant. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of EO 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order \nadverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall \nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO \n12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive \ninformation). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \n4 \n\n \n \n \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, corroborated by her credit report, establish two \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d), and \nAG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). \nThe security concerns raised in the SOR may be mitigated by any of the following \npotentially applicable factors: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; and \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nWhile AG \u00b6 20(d) applies to allegations 1.a, 1.b, 1.g, 1.m, and 1.n, none of the \nmitigating conditions apply to allegations 1.c~1.f. and 1.h~1.l., which total about $8,910. \nApplicant failed to meet her burden to mitigate the financial concerns set out in the SOR. \nFor these reasons, I find SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c~1.f. and 1.h~1.l. against Applicant, and Guideline F \nas a whole. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall common-sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \napplicable guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person. \nAn administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \n\u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \n5 \n\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis, \nand I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person, I conclude that Applicant still has significant, admitted past-due debts. \nAccordingly, Applicant has not carried her burden of showing that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant her eligibility for access to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. and 1.b: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c ~1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.g: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.h ~1.l: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.m ~1.n: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or \ncontinue Applicant\u2019s national security eligibility for access to classified information. \nClearance is denied. \nRichard A.

The \ndebts are established by Applicant\u2019s credit reports from August 2021 and August 2022 \nas well as his admissions. (Items 2, 5-6) \nApplicant\u2019s current financial issues began in 2017 when he stopped paying on his \nvehicle loan (SOR \u00b6 1.a), discussed below. He then experienced financial difficulties \nwith the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020. His wife, a registered nurse, left \nher employment because of COVID-19 related work restrictions.

(Item 7) This is not alleged in the SOR and will not be \nconsidered by me for disqualification purposes, but I may consider it as it may relate to \nany mitigating conditions and in my whole-person assessment. \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard \nindicates that security determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \n484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on \nmere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \nThe financial security concern is broader than the possibility that an individual \nmight knowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money. It \nencompasses concerns about an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities \nessential to protecting classified information. An individual who is financially \nirresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and \nsafeguarding classified information. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd.

The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe debts in the SOR, including a charged-off delinquent vehicle loan and \nmultiple delinquent credit cards, are established by Applicant\u2019s admissions and the \ncredit reports in the record. The above disqualifying conditions apply. \nThere are four conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security concerns \narising from Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nApplicant\u2019s financial issues began in 2017 when he stopped paying on his vehicle \nloan while hoping it would be forgiven as part of a legal settlement. However, rather \nthan follow up with the creditor or the court, Applicant took no further action, and the \ndebt remains unresolved. Then, with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and his \nwife\u2019s departure from her employment, Applicant\u2019s financial situation worsened. Still, \neven after discussing his delinquent debts during his background interview, Applicant \ntook no action to resolve them until after he received the SOR. Although he recently \nagreed to start payment plans on some of the accounts, he did not produce evidence of \npayments. \nAn applicant who waits until his clearance is in jeopardy before resolving debts \nmight be lacking in the judgment expected of those with access to classified information. \nISCR Case No. 15-03208 at 3 (App. Bd.

ISCR \nCase No. 17-04110 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 26, 2019). A meaningful track record of debt \nreduction incudes establishing a plan to resolve financial problems and taking significant \naction to implement that plan. ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). \nApplicant initially experienced financial difficulties in 2010 that were eventually \nresolved in 2013, resulting in a conditional clearance. He is again experiencing financial \ndifficulties that are recent and ongoing. His vehicle loan and several additional accounts \nremain unresolved. He recently initiated payment plans on several delinquent accounts, \nbut provided an insufficient track record of payments to conclude that the accounts are \nbeing resolved responsibly. Applicant\u2019s financial circumstances continue to cast doubt \non his current reliability, judgment and trustworthiness. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \nApplicant stated his delinquent debts in the SOR began with the COVID-19 \npandemic and his wife leaving her employment. To at least some extent, this was a \ncircumstance beyond his control, so AG \u00b6 20(b) has some application. However, \nApplicant stopped paying on his largest delinquent debt, the vehicle loan, in 2017. His \ndecision to not seek clarification of that account over the years was entirely within his \ncontrol. That delinquency also predates the pandemic by several years. He also \ndiscussed multiple delinquent accounts during his background interview in August 2021. \nHowever, he chose not to take any action to resolve those accounts until January 2023, \nafter he received the SOR. His recent promises to pay do not establish responsible \naction under the circumstances. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not fully apply. \nApplicant paid one account prior to the issuance of the SOR. He also made a \nsingle payment on his vehicle loan before deciding to dispute the account. He recently \nentered into payment plans on several of his other delinquent accounts, but provided \nlittle evidence of payments under those various plans. He has not shown enough of a \ntrack record of steady payments towards his debts to establish good faith. AG \u00b6 20(d) \ndoes not fully apply. \nApplicant admitted SOR \u00b6 1.a in his Answer, but later asserted that he is no \nlonger responsible for the debt. Thus, notwithstanding his admission, discussion of AG \n\u00b6 20(e) is warranted. Applicant stopped paying on his vehicle loan in 2017 when he \nlearned he might receive compensation from the creditor through a lawsuit. \nSubsequently, he never ascertained the applicability of the lawsuit to his loan. In \nJanuary 2023, after receiving the SOR, Applicant contacted the creditor and learned \nthat his loan was not part of the 2017 settlement. He has taken no further action to \naddress or dispute the debt, except to make one payment. He has not established a \nreasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of this debt. AG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant served active duty in the Army on two separate occasions and received \nan honorable discharge. He continues to serve as an Army Reservist. He previously \nexperienced financial difficulties in 2010, and was granted a clearance conditioned on \ndemonstrated financial stability. \nRecently, Applicant began taking steps toward establishing payment plans and \nresolving some of his delinquent accounts. However, he has not taken sufficient steps \nto address or dispute his largest debt, the vehicle loan. He has not established a reliable \nfinancial track record, accompanied by documented steady payments towards resolving \nhis delinquent debts. He has not met his burden of persuasion. Overall, the record \nevidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability \nfor a security clearance. I conclude that Applicant did not provide sufficient evidence to \nmitigate the financial security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.e-1.f: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.g-1.j: \nAgainst Applicant \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted the sole allegation in the SOR that he used marijuana with varying frequency from January 2003 to October 2022. His admission is incorporated into the findings of fact. (Item 2) After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and Items submitted, I make the following findings of fact: Applicant is 31 years old.

His admission is incorporated \ninto the findings of fact. (Item 2) After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings \nand Items submitted, I make the following findings of fact: \nApplicant is 31 years old. He earned a General Education Development (GED) \ncertificate in 2008 and a Certificate of Electrical Technician in 2010. He is divorced and \nhas two children, ages 12 and 15. He and his girlfriend have lived together since 2020. \nIn August 2020, he started a position with his current employer, a defense contractor. \nPreviously, he worked from August 2012 to August 2020 for a different defense \ncontractor. In April 2022, he completed his first security clearance application (SCA). In \nMay 2022, he was granted an interim secret security clearance. (Items 3, 6) \nIn June 2022, a government investigator interviewed Applicant. During that \ninterview, Applicant disclosed that he started using marijuana in 2002 when he was in \neighth grade. He used it with friends and has continued to use it since then. He uses it \nevery other day or twice a week to help him sleep, relax, or relieve a headache. He said \nhe did not disclose this information in his SCA because marijuana is legal in his home \nstate. When he turned 18 in 2006, he began purchasing marijuana at a dispensary with \nthe medical marijuana card he obtained for headaches. He also purchases it from \nfriends. He said marijuana does not affect his personality or judgment. (Item 4) \nWhile discussing Applicant\u2019s history of marijuana use, the investigator informed \nhim that using marijuana is considered an illegal drug for purposes of a security \nclearance. Applicant told the investigator that he intended to continue using it. (Item 4 at \n3) \nIn November 2022, Applicant completed interrogatories regarding his history of \nmarijuana use. He estimated that he started using it in January 2003 and used it once a \nweek or more up to October 16, 2022. He stated he did not intend to use it in the future \nbecause having a security clearance was more important than smoking marijuana. He \ndid not want to miss an opportunity to obtain a security clearance. (Item 5) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern for drug involvement and substance misuse is set out in AG \n\u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline describes conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 \n25. Two may be potentially disqualifying in this case:   \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia. \nApplicant illegally possessed and used marijuana from at least January 2003 to \nOctober 2022 in violation of federal law. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(c) are applicable. \nAG \u00b6 26 includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising under \nthis guideline. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility; and \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s long history of illegal possession and use of marijuana spans from \n2003 to 2022. It did not, allegedly, end until about three weeks before he submitted \ninterrogatories about his use. He stated in his interrogatories that he intended to stop \nusing it. His extensive history of using marijuana casts doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, good judgment, and willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations. The evidence does not establish mitigation under AG \u00b6 26 (a). Applicant \nacknowledged his long-term use but has not established a pattern of abstinence. In fact, \nhe asserted that his frequent use of marijuana does not affect his reliability or judgment. \nAG \u00b6 26 (b) does not apply. Despite his frequent marijuana use, he has not been \nevaluated for substance abuse or addiction or participated in a treatment program and \nhe has not received a favorable prognosis from a duly qualified medical professional, as \nrequired to establish mitigation under AG \u00b6 26 (d). \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline H in my whole-person analysis. Applicant has a long history \nof using marijuana, which may be legal in his state, but is illegal under Federal law for \nindividuals working for the government and for those pursuing a security clearance. At \nthis time, he has not established a sufficient period of abstinence and only recently \ndecided to quit using marijuana. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with significant \nquestions and doubts about Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nApplicant did not mitigate the security concerns under Guideline H (drug involvement \nand substance misuse). \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAgainst Applicant \n  Subparagraph 1.a:  \n Against Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interests to grant Applicant national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance.

In his Answer, Applicant admits he used marijuana \nwith varying frequency from about 2017 to about April 2022. He told the investigator \nduring the hiring process in 2022 he stopped using marijuana for a two-month period \nbecause he wanted to pass a drug test. (Item 3 at 8, 9.) He states he stopped using five \ndays prior to his security clearance interview. He had vowed to never use marijuana again \nand said that he had \u201cthrown away the drugs and paraphernalia. (Item 3 at 6.) His last \nuse was on April 23, 2022. (Item 3 at 5.) He states in his Answer and in response to \ninterrogatories he does not intend to continue using marijuana and that he has moved \naway from where he went to college and no longer associates with people involved in \n\u201ccriminal activity.\u201d (Item 3 at 6.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b -- purchasing marijuana. In his Answer, Applicant admits to \npurchasing marijuana from about 2017 to about April 2022. He would buy the marijuana \nin one state, at a recreational dispensary, and transport it back to his state because he \nunderstood it to be against the law in his state to purchase and possess marijuana. (Item \n3 at 5 and 8.) He states in his Answer that he does not intend to possess marijuana in the \nfuture. He specified in his interrogatory response he did not sell or manufacture the drug \nduring this time period. (Item 3 at 5.) He also stated he no longer possesses unused \ndrugs, substances, or paraphernalia, and no longer associates with persons who use \nillegal substances (to include marijuana and derivative products) or frequent places where \nhe may believe illegal substances are being used. (Item 3 at 6-7.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c -- using Psilocybin Mushrooms. In his Answer, Applicant admits he \nused psilocybin mushrooms in about July 2019. Under further questioning during his \nsecurity clearance interview he admitted to using mushrooms at the beach with his \ngirlfriend. (Item 3 at 9.) He states this was an \u201ceye opening experience and this was the \nonly time he used mushrooms. (Item 3 at 9.) \nSOR \u00b6 2.a -- falsifying material facts. Applicant admits he falsified his answer \nto Question 23 of his SCA, which asked whether he had used or otherwise been illegally \ninvolved with a drug or controlled substance.

(Item 3 at \n8.) \nSOR \u00b6 2.b \u2013 falsifying material facts. Applicant admitted he deliberately falsified \nhis answer to Question 23 of his SCA, which asked whether he had any additional illegal \nuse of a drug or controlled substance to disclose . He answered \u201cNo\u201d and failed to disclose \nhis use of psilocybin mushrooms in July 2019. \nApplicant explained in his April 2022 security clearance interview that after \ncompleting his SCA in March 2022 he researched marijuana use and learned he could \nnot use marijuana while holding a security clearance. (Item 3 at 8-9.) He continued to use \nand possess marijuana up until his security clearance interview. (Item 3 at 9.) In the \nNovember 2022 interrogatory responses, he affirms he no longer uses or possesses any \nmarijuana, and he no longer associates with people who do. (Item 3 at 6-7.)   \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial\nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions in his Answer to the SOR and elsewhere in the record are \nsufficient to raise the following disqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 25: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n           \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n(a): any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n(c): illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 26(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \nAG \u00b6 26(b): the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) \nchanging or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) \nproviding a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement \nand substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or \nmisuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \nAG \u00b6 26(a) is not established. Applicant has established a history of illegally \npurchasing, possessing, and using marijuana in violation of state and federal law. His last \ndrug involvement was on April 23, 2022. He has stated an intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse and acknowledges that any future involvement or \nmisuse is grounds for revocation of national security. However, this period is not long \nenough to overcome security concerns raised by his five years of repeated drug abuse. \nHis actions raise questions about his ability and willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. \nAG \u00b6 26(b) is not established. Applicant stated in his security clearance interview \nand in written interrogatories that he intends ot abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse. He notes he completed his college education, and he has moved to a \nnew state to work. The one cited two-month period of abstinence was to avoid testing \npositive on a hiring urinalysis. After researching marijuana use, he continued to use it until \njust a few days prior to his security clearance interview. His abstinence has been tactical. \nIt is also recent. He has not had time to establish a pattern of abstinence. Further, given \nApplicant\u2019s record of falsifying about the full extent of his drug use (see below), his \nassertions of changed circumstances are not credible. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \nApplicant's intentional failure to disclose his use of mushrooms and the full extent \nof his marijuana use in his March 2022 SCA raises the following disqualifying condition: \nAG \u00b616(a): deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, \nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security eligibility \nor trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially relevant: \nAG \u00b6 17(a): the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the \nomission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the \nfacts; and \nAG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances \nthat it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \nAG \u00b6 17(a) is not established. The evidence reflects that Applicant did not promptly \nattempt to correct his SCA after he did his research. He admitted his omissions only under \nquestioning by an investigator during his security clearance interview. \nAG \u00b6 17(c) is not established. Applicant's false statements were not \u201cminor,\u201d \nbecause such statements strike at the heart of the security clearance process. See ISCR \nCase No. 09-01652 (App. Bd. Aug. 8, 2011.) An applicant who deliberately fails to give \nfull, frank, and candid answers to the government in connection with a security clearance \ninvestigation or adjudication interferes with the integrity of the industrial security program. \nISCR Case No. 01-03132 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 8, 2002). Applicant's false statements were \nrecent and calculated to give him the most favorable hiring profile because they involved \nthe current adjudication of his application for a security clearance. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n      \n \n \n  \n \n  \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines H and E in my whole-person\nanalysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Applicant\u2019s marijuana use is \nrecent, and he lied about the full extent of his drug involvement on his SCA. Because \nApplicant requested a determination on the record without a hearing, I had no opportunity \nto evaluate his credibility and sincerity based on demeanor. See ISCR Case No. 01-\n12350 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jul. 23, 2003). After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating \nconditions under Guidelines H and E and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the \nwhole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the concerns raised by his drug \ninvolvement and personal conduct. \n \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nAgainst Applicant \n Subparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \n  Subparagraphs 2.a-2.b:\nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

Applicant is a 57-year-old consultant employed by a defense contractor since June 2017. He served on active duty in the U.S. Air Force from March 1986 to April 2011, when he retired as a master sergeant (pay grade E-7). He held a security clearance while he was in the Air Force. He was unemployed from April 2011 until he was hired by his current employer. He received a bachelor\u2019s degree from an online university in May 2017. Applicant married in June 1986 and divorced in September 2006. He has two adult children from his marriage, and a 20-year-old daughter from a subsequent relationship. He has provided financial support totaling about $30,000 to his youngest daughter. The SOR alleges that Applicant failed to file federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b) In his SCA, he disclosed his failure to file federal and state returns and stated that he was unsure whether he owed any taxes. He stated that he had \u201cno legitimate reason\u201d for not filing the returns.

His admissions \nare incorporated in my findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 57-year-old consultant employed by a defense contractor since \nJune 2017. He served on active duty in the U.S. Air Force from March 1986 to April \n2011, when he retired as a master sergeant (pay grade E-7). He held a security \nclearance while he was in the Air Force. He was unemployed from April 2011 until he \nwas hired by his current employer. He received a bachelor\u2019s degree from an online \nuniversity in May 2017. \nApplicant married in June 1986 and divorced in September 2006. He has two \nadult children from his marriage, and a 20-year-old daughter from a subsequent \nrelationship. He has provided financial support totaling about $30,000 to his youngest \ndaughter. \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant failed to file federal and state income tax returns \nfor tax years 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b) In his SCA, he \ndisclosed his failure to file federal and state returns and stated that he was unsure \nwhether he owed any taxes. He stated that he had \u201cno legitimate reason\u201d for not filing \nthe returns. (FORM Item 2 at 35) When he was interviewed by a security investigator in \nApril 2021, he attributed his failure to file the returns to \u201cforgetting and a lack of \nmotivation.\u201d (FORM Item 3 at 9) In his answer to the SOR, he stated that he had filed \nthe federal and state returns for 2019, 2020, and 2021, and that he had contacted a \nprofessional tax preparer to obtain the necessary documentation to file his federal and \nstate returns for 2018. He did not submit any documentation to support his answer. \nThe SOR also alleges a delinquent auto loan charged off for $5,151. (SOR \u00b6 1.c) \nIn Applicant\u2019s interview with a security investigator in April 2021, he attributed this \ndelinquency to unemployment after retiring from the Air Force and his retired pay being \ninsufficient to pay his debts. (FORM Item 3 at 9-10) In his answer to the SOR, he \nclaimed that this debt was paid in full. He submitted no documentation to support his \nclaim. Credit reports from March 2021 and July 2022 reflect that the debt was \nunresolved. (FORM Item 4 at 3; FORM Item 5 at 2) However, the debt is not reflected in \na credit report from January 2023. (FORM item 6)  \nThe March 2021 credit report also reflects two credit-card accounts charged off \nfor $4,475 and $77, and two consumer accounts placed for collection of $4,320 and \n$655. These debts are not alleged in the SOR. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant\nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden\nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.\n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v.\nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines\npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the\ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.

Apr. 20, 2016).   \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

An individual who is \nfinancially overextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or \notherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See \nISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence in the FORM establish the following \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \nAG \u00b6 19(f): failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax as required. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \nAG \u00b6 20(g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate \ntax authority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with \nthose arrangements. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s failures to file federal and state tax \nreturns are recent, multiple, and did not occur under circumstances making recurrence \nunlikely. His delinquent auto loan is the only debt alleged, but it is one of five delinquent \ndebts reflected in the March 2021 credit report.1 It is recent and did not occur under \ncircumstances making recurrence unlikely. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not established for Applicant\u2019s failures to timely file his federal and \nstate income tax returns. His unemployment was a condition largely beyond his control, \nbut he did not indicate that it prevented him from filing his returns. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) and 20(d) are not established for the delinquent auto loan. The \ndelinquent auto loan was the result of his unemployment, but he did not act to address it \nresponsibly. Evidence of past irresponsibility is not mitigated by payment of debts only \nunder pressure of qualifying for a security clearance. Applicants who begin to address \ntheir security-significant conduct only when their personal interests are at stake may be \nlacking in judgment and reliability. ISCR Case No. 16-01211 (App. Bd. May 30, 2018). \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is not established. Applicant admitted that he has not yet filed his \nfederal and state income tax returns for 2018. He submitted no documentary evidence \nto support his claim that he has filed the federal and state tax returns for 2019, 2020, \nand 2021. Applicants who claim that financial delinquencies have been resolved are \nexpected to present documentary evidence supporting those claims. See ISCR Case \nNo. 15-03363 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 19, 2016). \n1 Conduct not alleged in the SOR may be considered to assess an applicant's credibility; to evaluate an \napplicant's evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; to consider whether an \napplicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; to decide whether a particular provision of the \nAdjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or to provide evidence for whole person analysis ISCR Case No. \n03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006).

In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person \nanalysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Because Applicant requested \na determination on the record without a hearing, I had no opportunity to evaluate his \ncredibility and sincerity based on demeanor. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. \nBd. Jul. 23, 2003). After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under \nGuideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by his failures to \ntimely file his federal and state income tax returns and his delinquent auto loan. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.
