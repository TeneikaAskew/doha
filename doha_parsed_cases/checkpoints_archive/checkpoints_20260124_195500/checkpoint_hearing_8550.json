The action was taken under Executive\nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960),\nas amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the\nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) as promulgated by the President on December 29,\n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September\n1, 2006. \n \nSeptember 30, 2009\n\n2\nApplicant answered the SOR on May 26, 2009, admitting all of the allegations\nexcept subparagraph 1.j. He requested a hearing, and the case was assigned to me on\nJune 11, 2009. On June 24, 2009, a notice of hearing was issued scheduling the case\nfor July 28, 2009. On July 27, 2009, I continued the case on my own motion, and\nrescheduled it with the agreement of the parties for August 3, 2009. The hearing was\nconducted as rescheduled. I received 11 government exhibits, four Applicant exhibits,\nand Applicant\u2019s testimony. The transcript was received on August 7, 2009.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 44-year-old single man. A prior marriage ended in divorce in 1989.\nApplicant has no children. He has a high school education, and has taken some\ntechnical courses over the years (Tr. 24).\nFor the past two years, Applicant has worked as an electrician for a defense\ncontractor. Specifically, Applicant focuses on quality control and safety issues (Exhibit\nA). According to his supervisor, he has strong work habits, and his performance level is\nhigh (Exhibit C). According to the company\u2019s manager for safety and quality assurance,\nApplicant is highly observant of potential quality control problems, and has a dynamic\npersonality that prompts others to \u201cpick up their standards a notch higher\u201d (Exhibit A).\nApplicant served in the U.S. Navy from 1983 to 1987. In November 1986,\nApplicant\u2019s roommate, a fellow sailor, borrowed his car without permission (Answer at\n1). Applicant then left his duty station without authority, located his roommate, and\nattacked him, \u201cgrabbing him around the throat and hitting his head against the bulkhead\nseveral times\u201d (Exhibit 4). Subsequently, Applicant was charged under Article 15 of the\nUnited States Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) for assaulting and threatening a fellow\nsailor. He received 45 days restriction, 45 days extra duty, and two weeks forfeiture of\npay (Exhibit 4; Tr. 26). \nIn April 1987, a disagreement among fellow sailors, including Applicant, which\noccurred during an off-duty softball game, degenerated into a brawl (Tr. 27). During the\nmelee, Applicant struck a seaman several times \u201cabout the face and body with his\nhands and feet\u201d (Exhibit 5). Subsequently, Applicant received a general discharge\nunder other than honorable conditions (Exhibit 6).\nOn or about June 1994, Applicant went to a gas station. After pumping gas into\nhis car, he realized that he did not have any cash (Tr. 28). Applicant offered to pay with\na check, but the clerk refused to accept a check without any identification (Id.). Because\nApplicant needed his identification to cash the check at a bank, he left his license tag\nwith the clerk, and drove away, headed to the bank. The clerk called the police, who\narrested and charged Applicant with theft under $300. Applicant spent the night in jail.\nThe following morning, he was released, and issued a ticket (Tr. 30). At a court hearing\nthe following month, he pleaded guilty and paid the fine (Id.). The amount of the fine is\nunknown from the record.\n\nApplicant\u2019s recollection of this incident constitutes the only record evidence. He did not specifically recall\n1\nthe date of the incident.\n3\nIn August 2000, during a concert at the beach, Applicant \u201cgot into some verbal\nconfrontations\u201d with some people who were \u201craising a ruckus\u201d (Tr. 32). The police\narrived and arrested everyone, including Applicant, charging them with being drunk in\npublic (Id.). Applicant and the others were then taken to an overnight holding cell (Tr.\n33). Applicant was released the next day, and issued a $25 ticket, which he paid (Tr. 33,\n36). \nA few months after the arrest, Applicant was stopped by the police at a sobriety\ncheckpoint.  Although he was sober, he did not have his operator\u2019s license in his\n1\npossession. He was then issued a traffic ticket for driving without an operator\u2019s license\n(Tr. 32-33). Applicant paid the ticket.\nLate one evening in March 2004, Applicant was charged with public intoxication\nafter police observed him staggering down the street (Tr. 38, 87). Applicant was\narrested and charged with being drunk in public (Tr. 37). After spending the night in jail,\nhe was issued a $25 ticket, which he paid in lieu of appearing in court (Tr. 37, 87).\nIn approximately June 1997, when Applicant was 32 years old, he began\nexperimenting with marijuana (Answer at 2). Over the course of the following year, he\nsmoked it approximately once per week (Tr. 53). During this period, he purchased it\napproximately four times, spending $200 per purchase (Exhibit 3 at 7). He never\nsmoked the drug with other people. Instead, he would smoke it alone while working on\nhis vehicle (Id. at 18). During an interview with an investigative agent, Applicant stated\nthat the marijuana made him feel relaxed and focused (Id.). At the hearing, Applicant\ntestified that he did not enjoy smoking marijuana because it made him feel paranoid (Tr.\n52-53).\nApplicant contends he has not smoked marijuana since 1998 (Tr. 87). In 2007,\nhe tested positive for marijuana in a pre-employment urinalysis screening for the job he\nheld immediately before he began working at his current job (Answer at 3). He contends\nthat he had not been smoking marijuana before he took the urinalysis, and questioned\nthe accuracy of the urinalysis (Tr. 54). He informed his then-employer who told him to\nundergo another urinalysis (Tr. 56). The following week, Applicant underwent another\nurinalysis and passed (Tr. 56). He worked for this employer for one month before\nleaving to work for his current employer (Id.). His decision to leave was unrelated to his\ninitial failure of the urinalysis (Tr. 59). Applicant voluntarily disclosed this information to\nan investigative agent (Exhibit 3 at 13).\nOn July 20, 2009, Applicant executed a statement of intent not to use any illegal\ndrugs in the future (Exhibit D). He has relocated to a new town and does not socialize at\nplaces where there is heavy drinking or illegal activity (Tr. 96).\n\n4\nApplicant completed a security clearance application in December 2007. He did\nnot disclose his alcohol-related charges or arrests in response to Section 23d. (Have\nyou ever been charged with or convicted of any offenses related to alcohol or drugs?).\nHe testified that he had \u201cforgotten all about them\u201d (Tr. 40).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be\nconsidered in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a\nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d\nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\nAnalysis\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nThe security concern under this guideline is as follows:\n[c]onduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process (AG \u00b6 15). \n\n5\nSOR subparagraph 1.g, \u201c[o]n or about November 10, 2001, you failed to appear\nin [municipality X] on a misdemeanor charge\u201d does not identify the specific charge, and\nis therefore overbroad. Nevertheless, Applicant admitted this allegation, and identified\nthe charge as a traffic infraction which he paid, obviating the need to appear in court. I\nresolve SOR subparagraph 1.g in Applicant\u2019s favor.\nApplicant\u2019s omission of his alcohol-related arrests from his 2007 security\nclearance application, as alleged in SOR subparagraph 1.j, raises the issue of whether\nAG \u00b6 16(a), \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any\npersonnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to\nconduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities,\u201d applies. Applicant contends that he did not include his alcohol-related\narrests on his security clearance application because he forgot about them. On both\noccasions, however, the police jailed him overnight. Under these circumstances, it is not\ncredible that Applicant would forget these arrests. His credibility is further undermined\nby the contradictory statements he provided throughout the investigatory process\nregarding whether he enjoyed smoking marijuana. AG \u00b6 16(a) applies without\nmitigation.\nApplicant\u2019s 2009 falsification of his security clearance, together with the episodes\nof misconduct while in the military, his multiple arrests, and his abuse of marijuana\ntrigger the application of AG \u00b6 16(c), \u201ccredible adverse information in several\nadjudicative issue areas that is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any\nother single guideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person\nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor,\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating\nthat the person may not properly safeguard protected information.\u201d\nThe relevant, potentially mitigating condition is AG \u00b6 17(c), \u201cthe offense is so\nminor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened\nunder such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on\nthe individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d Much of Applicant\u2019s\nmisconduct was either minor, or remote in time. However, the security significance of\nApplicant\u2019s misconduct is elevated by its varied, repetitive nature, and its frequency.\nMoreover, Applicant\u2019s falsification of his security clearance application occurred less\nthan six months ago. Upon viewing Applicant\u2019s personal conduct in its totality, I\nconclude that AG \u00b6 17(c) does not apply.\nGuideline H, Drug Involvement\nUnder this guideline, \u201cuse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can\nraise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may\nimpair judgment, and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness\nto comply with laws, rules, and regulations,\u201d (AG \u00b6 24). Applicant\u2019s abuse of marijuana\nfrom 1997 through 1998, and his 2007 failure of a urinalysis, testing positive for\n\n6\nmarijuana, trigger the application of AG \u00b6 25(a), \u201cany drug abuse,\u201d and AG \u00b6 25(b),\n\u201ctesting positive for illegal drug use.\u201d\nThe relevant mitigating conditions are as follows:\nAG \u00b6 26(a) - the behavior happened so long ago was so infrequent, or\nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not\ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment; and,\nAG \u00b6 26(b), - a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future,\nsuch as:\n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;\n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used;\n(3) an appropriate period of abstinence; and,\n(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for\nany violation.\nApplicant\u2019s recent positive urinalysis undercuts his contention that he has not\nused marijuana since 1998. His contention that the urinalysis was inaccurate is not\ncredible given the falsification of his security clearance application, as described earlier.\nI conclude AG \u00b6 26(a) does not apply.\nAG \u00b6\u00b6 26(b)(1) and 26(b)(2) are not relevant because Applicant always used\nmarijuana while home alone. The failed 2007 urinalysis casts doubt on Applicant\u2019s\ncontention that he has not used marijuana since 1998. Consequently, he has failed to\nestablish that AG \u00b6 26(b)(3) applies. He did, however, submit a signed statement of\nintent not to use any marijuana in the future. AG \u00b6 26(b)(4) applies.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\n\n7\nBetween 1997 and 2004, Applicant engaged in a variety of misconduct including\nfighting with fellow sailors while in the Navy, drinking in public, and smoking marijuana.\nThe minor nature of most of these offenses is offset by their repetitive nature. Moreover,\nimmaturity does not mitigate the behavior because Applicant was 32 years old when he\nchose to smoke marijuana, and 39 when he committed his most recent alcohol-related\noffense. Most importantly, he failed to be fully forthcoming about his alcohol-related\noffenses when he completed his security clearance application in 2009. Applicant\ndeserves credit for his solid work performance. However, this is insufficient to outweigh\nthe security concerns generated by his history of adverse personal conduct and drug\ninvolvement.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.h - 1.j:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline H:\nAGAINST Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                             \nMARC E. CURRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

He was found guilty and fined $200.  \n \n \nOn February 15, 2000, he was charged with Speed Exceeding Limit. He was fine \n$80.50. \n \n \nOn December 29, 1998, he was charged with Purchase Etc. Alcohol by Minor. \nHe pled guilty and was fined $175. \n \n \nApplicant completed his security clearance application (SCA) on November 7, \n2007. In response to question 23 inquiring about his police record, Applicant admitted \nhe was charged in July 2002 and went to court in February 2003 for Driving While \nImpaired and with a suspended license. He did not list all of the other offenses he was \ncharged with or convicted as of that day. He did not divulge the additional charges when \nhe was interviewed by an Office of Personnel Management Investigator (OPM) on \nDecember 18, 2007. He was interviewed again on March 6, 2008, and questioned why \nhe failed to list his other alcohol-related offenses. He stated he should have revealed \nthem, but thought the time frame was five years. He stated that if he wanted to conceal \nthe information he would not have disclosed the Driving While Impaired charge. He also \nstated that he completely forgot about the other charges and that all of the other \ncharges except the Driving While Impaired charge were dismissed.4 This is contrary to \nthe court records that document he was convicted of Driving While Impaired, eluding a \nuniformed police officer, turning off his lights to avoid identification, and driving on a \nsuspended license. He stated in his interview that he did not disclose the other charges \nbecause he thought they were trivial compared to the Driving While Impaired and they \nwere all dismissed. He acknowledged he was aware of his past offenses and did not \nforget them.5  \n \nApplicant also failed to list in response to question 23 the charges from \nDecember 29, 1998, for purchasing alcohol as a minor and the July 3, 2001, charges for \npurchasing alcohol as a minor and driving with a suspended license. He explained that \n \n4 GE 4 at page 2. \n \n5 Tr. 74-83; GE 4. \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                                          \nhe did not know why he failed to list these offenses. He explained that he had not \npurchased alcohol, but rather had consumed it as a minor, but the charges list the term \n\u201cetcetera\u201d which includes consumption. He admitted he was driving on a suspended \nlicense and had done so on other occasions with the suspension. He understood he \nwas not supposed to drive. He drove to and from work for approximately a year while \nhis license was suspended. He also drove other times. Applicant\u2019s driver\u2019s license was \nsuspended from June 2000 to January 2005, except for the time between November \n2003 and January 2004, when it was reinstated. His suspensions were imposed due to \nthe various offenses he committed and because he continued to violate his \nsuspension.6 \n \n \nApplicant did not disclose that the reason he was discharged from the National \nGuard was due to his illegal drug abuse. Question 23(e) asks if he was subject to \ndisciplinary action under the Uniform Code of Military Justice. Apparently, Applicant did \nnot receive disciplinary action for his drug use while in the military, but rather was \ndischarged for misconduct and received a General Discharge. There is no evidence to \nsupport he received disciplinary action. Therefore, he was not required to list any action \nin this section of his SCA. He did, however, fail to disclose on his SCA that he used \ndrugs while he held a security clearance. He stated he was unaware that he had a \nclearance at the time. He thought he only had the clearance when he was actually \nserving on active duty with his reserve unit.7 I do not find his explanation regarding this \nfailure to be credible. \n \n \nIn response to Question 23(f) inquiring if in the last seven year Applicant had \nbeen arrested for, charged with, or convicted of any offense(s) not listed in the other \nsections of the question, he answered \u201cno\u201d. He failed to list he had been charged with \nsimple assault on October 11, 2004, and received a fine. He admitted he was arrested, \nfingerprinted, photographed and spent the night in jail. He hired an attorney and worked \nout a plea deal. The case was dismissed. He stated he later disclosed the information \nduring his background interview.8 \n \n \nIn response to Question 24(a) inquiring if Applicant had used illegal drugs in the \nlast seven years or since he was 16, whichever was shorter he failed to disclose he had \nused illegal drugs in November 2001. Applicant stated he miscalculated the years and \nsaid he had previously listed it on an earlier SCA.9 Applicant completed a Questionnaire \nfor Public Trust Position (SF 85P) dated February 6, 2003. Question 21 of the SF 85P \nasked if in the last year he had illegally used a controlled substance. He answered \u201cno.\u201d \nHe was discharged from the National Guard for drug abuse on October 22, 2002. It is \npossible that it was more than a year since he had used illegal drugs and his answer \n \n6 Tr. 32-43; GE 3, 12, 13, and 14. \n \n7 Tr. 23, 96-99. \n \n8 Tr. 65-71; AE 5, 10 and 11. \n \n9 Tr. 22-23, 62-65; GE 1. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                                          \nwas truthful. However, it is inconsistent with his explanation regarding the omissions on \nhis 2007 SCA that he previously provided the information on the earlier SF 85P \nquestionnaire, which did not have this information. He then stated that he completed a \ntotally different SCA at an earlier date that included the omitted information. He did not \nretain a copy of this application and the government did not have it in its possession. I \ndid not find Applicant\u2019s testimony credible.10  \n \nApplicant also failed to disclose on the 2003 SF 85P the Driving While Impaired \ncharges from July 2002, and other offenses from July 3, 2001, August 7, 2000, July 24, \n2000, and December 29, 1998. (See above paragraphs for the specific charges)11 His \nexplanation for why he did not divulge on his SF 85P that he had been arrested for \nvarious charges in July 2002 was because he believed he was not charged yet and he \nhad not been to court at that point. However, he admitted he knew he had been \narrested, had been handcuffed, placed in a police cruiser, photographed and \nfingerprinted, and had received a notice in the mail about the charges. He also \nexplained the reason he did not disclose the Driving While Impaired incident was \nbecause he was distraught over the death of his brother, six months earlier, in a single \ncar accident. He explained the reason he did not disclose the other offenses from July \n2002 were because they were traffic violations and he did not pay a fine. He learned \nfrom the investigator that fines had been imposed, but suspended, and he should have \nlisted them. Applicant stated he did not know why he did not list the July 3, 2001 \noffense.12 I do not find any of his explanations credible. \n \n \nApplicant did not list the three bad check offenses on his 2003 SF 85P because \nhe stated he did not realize he had been charged criminally. Applicant did not have an \nexplanation for why he did not think he was charged criminally when he received court \ndocuments in the mail. Although Applicant never appeared in court, he admitted that he \npled guilty and was fined three times between 2000 and 2001 for bad check charges. \nHe provided conflicting testimony about whether he made restitution before he received \nthe summons. He verified he was notified by mail of the court\u2019s finding. He also \nprovided confusing testimony about whether he paid the fines.13  \n \n \nApplicant was arrested four times for driving with a suspended or revoked license \nfrom 2000 to 2002. He does not remember many of the incidents. He does recall being \npulled over by the police, but does not think he was arrested. His explanation for driving \non a suspended license was, \u201cI still have bills to pay.\u201d He did not know why he did not \nlist these offenses on his 2003 SF 85P. He then testified he did not list them because he \nwas a minor.14  Applicant was over 18 in 2000. \n \n10 Tr. 22-23, 57-62; GE 1, 2 and 4. \n \n11 SOR 1.d, 1.f, 1.j, 1.k. and 1.m. \n \n12 Tr. 23-32, 56. \n \n13 Tr. 44-47. \n \n14 Tr. 46-54. \n\n \n6 \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                          \n \nApplicant stated he did not deliberately or intentionally fail to divulge the \ninformation required on his SCA and SF 85F. He does not know why he did not list \ncertain offenses. Regarding some omissions, he believed he did not have to list them \nbecause of a five-year period. He is not sure why he thought there was a five-year \nperiod. Regarding other omissions, he explained he misread the questions, forgot about \nthe offenses, or thought he did not have to disclose them because the charges were \ndismissed or he only paid fines.15  \n \n \nApplicant testified he made mistakes and used poor judgment. He has since \nmatured. He is a family man now and is devoted to providing the best life he can for his \nfamily. He does not drink to intoxication. Applicant volunteers his time at a mental health \ncenter and has taken a mission trip with his church to build homes.16  \n \n \nApplicant provided character statements from coworkers, a supervisor, a friend, \nand a family member. He is considered an exceptionally competent employee, a quick \nlearner, and very dependable. He has a strong work ethic and is a devoted family man. \nHe is also considered trustworthy, honest, and a man of integrity.17 Applicant provided \nphotographs of awards he received from his employer.18 \n \n \nI find Applicant intentionally and deliberately failed to divulge important \ninformation on both his SCA and SF 85P. His testimony was not credible for why on two \ndifference documents he failed to provide complete disclosure of important information \nabout his past. His explanations for his repeated omissions were not credible.  \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \n \n \n15 Tr. 26-28. \n \n16 Tr. 100-103. \n \n17  Tr. 21-22; AE D. \n \n18 Tr. 20-22; AE A. \n\n \n7 \n \n \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15The applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct.  \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I have specifically considered the following: \n\n \n8 \n \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning \nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent \nmedical authority, or other official government representative;  \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not \nproperly safeguard protected information; and \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such \nas (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \nI have considered all of the facts and find Applicant deliberately omitted \nconcealed, misled, and falsified information on his SCA and his SF 85P. Applicant used \nillegal drugs while holding a security clearance. He committed alcohol-related offenses. \nHe had his driver\u2019s license suspended several times and ignored the suspensions and \ndrove his vehicle. Although Applicant\u2019s drug offense and some of his alcohol offenses \nwere several years ago, I find, combined with all of his other offenses, his behavior and \nconduct demonstrate questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of \ncandor, and an unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. I find all of the above \ndisqualifying conditions apply. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from personal conduct. I have considered all of the mitigating \nconditions under AG \u00b6 17 and especially considered the following: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts;  \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n\n \n9 \n \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy , unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress.  \nApplicant did not make an effort to correct the omissions and falsifications on his \nSCA or his SF 85P before being confronted. He was not entirely truthful during his first \ninterview, thereby continuing to mislead the investigator. Applicant\u2019s explanations for his \nomissions were inconsistent and not believable.  \nApplicant has a long history of violating the law. He was discharged from the \nmilitary due to illegal drug use. He used the drugs while he held a security clearance. \nHe has several alcohol-related offenses. He repeatedly had his driver\u2019s license \nsuspended, yet continued to drive. He did not grasp the importance of obeying the law, \nbut rather rationalized his actions. Some of Applicant\u2019s criminal offenses occurred \nseveral years ago. He believes he has matured and is now a responsible family man \ndevoted to his family. Although that may be true, I have serious concerns about his \nfailure to honestly and truthfully divulge all of his background information, which had he \ndone so would have reflected a changed man. His numerous explanations and excuses \nfor failing to provide complete and honest answers on both his SCA and SF 85P are a \ncause of concern. His inconsistent answers and omissions, along with his history of \nviolating the law are not minor issues nor were his actions infrequent. I find they cast \ndoubt on his reliability, trustworthiness and good judgment. Applicant has not provided \nsufficient evidence to convince me he has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. Applicant failed to mitigate the \npersonal conduct security concerns. I find none of the mitigating conditions apply. \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.    \n     \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a young man devoted to \nhis family. He has a good work record. Applicant has a significant history of rules \nviolations, including use of marijuana while in the National Guard and holding a security \nclearance, repeated alcohol-related offenses, driving while impaired, and repeatedly \ndriving on a suspended license. Although many of these violations could be attributed to \nhis age and maturity at the time of the offenses, he did not truthfully divulge all of his \npast indiscretions and offenses on his 2007 SCA and 2003 SF 85P. His lack of candor \nand inconsistent answers raise security concerns. Overall, the record evidence leaves \nme with serious questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the \nsecurity concerns arising from his personal conduct.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs  1.a-1.o: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph    1.p: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs  1.q-1.t: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

His debts were \ndischarged on May 19, 1999.  Applicant lost several contractual employment positions, \nand could not pay his debts.  He sought legal advice about the various options he had \nto pay his debts.  After consultations, he decided to file Chapter 7 bankruptcy.  His case \nwas a \u201cno asset\u201d case because there were no assets in the bankruptcy estate above the \nexemptions Applicant claimed under the state law.  Applicant\u2019s total assets were listed \nas $46,225.  His total liabilities were $68,164.27, of which $56,700 was for his mobile \nhome, and two vehicles he purchased.  He surrendered one vehicle and kept the mobile \nhome and pickup truck (valued at $30,000 and $15,000, respectively).  The remaining \n$11,464.27 consisted of a $3,000 loan, two medical bills, five credit cards or department \nstore charge accounts, a cable television bill, and an air conditioning repair bill.  \nApplicant used his credit cards during periods of unemployment prior to filing \nbankruptcy to pay his debts.  His monthly income when he filed the bankruptcy was \n$2,258.45, including his wife\u2019s income.   His monthly expenses were $2,429.87. As of \nMay 11, 2000, the date of a statement Applicant gave to a Government investigator, he \npaid his current bills on time. (Items 2-6; Response) \n \n \nApplicant owes $19,964 on an auto loan pertaining to a repossessed automobile.  \nApplicant purchased a pickup truck in 1998, before he knew he would lose his job and \nmight have to file bankruptcy.  He kept the truck and made the payments, reaffirming \nthe debt from the bankruptcy.  Then, in 2000, when both he and his wife were \nemployed, they purchased a Chevy Blazer, financed by the same company, which \nloaned Applicant the money to buy the pickup truck.  In 2003, Applicant and his wife \nwere unemployed.  They withdrew money from his wife\u2019s IRA account and paid off the \nloan on the 1999 pickup truck because they had paid on that loan longer and had more \ninvested.  That payment resolution is shown on the credit reports of October 11, 2007, \nand September 1, 2008, in the file.  The monthly $600 payments on the Blazer could not \nbe maintained, and the lender repossessed the vehicle.  The balance owed on the loan \n\n \n3 \n \n \nis $19,964.  It is owed to another creditor who purchased the loan from the original \nlender.  Applicant denies owing this debt because the lender repossessed the vehicle \nand sold it.   Applicant claims in his Response to the FORM that the vehicle sold for \n$10,000, and they paid $18,000 on the vehicle when they possessed it.  He further \nclaims he borrowed $20,000 to purchase the vehicle, and the amount sought by the \ncreditor is nearly that amount, after Applicant has already paid them $18,000 plus the \n$10,000 realized from the sale, making the amount sought far greater than the original \nloaned amount plus the interest required under the loan agreement.  But Applicant did \nnot submit his loan agreement for the Blazer as part of his Answer to the SOR or his \nResponse to the FORM. This debt remains unpaid. (Items 4, 6, 7, 8; Answer; \nResponse) \n \n \nApplicant admits he owed $64 to a collection agency.  He paid that debt with a \ncheck dated September 16, 2008.  This debt resulted from a medical procedure.  \nApplicant claims it was treatment for his wife\u2019s burst appendix when they were both \nunemployed.  The debt dates from 2005, when the last payment was made.  (Items 2, 7, \n8; Answer; Response) \n \n \nApplicant owed another collection agency $1,276 for a medical debt.  While the \nSOR alleges this amount, both credit reports in the file show only a $25 debt.  It was \nunpaid as of October 11, 2007, but the credit report of July 1, 2008, shows the debt was \npaid January 2008.  This debt is paid. (Items 2, 4, 7, 8; Answer; Response) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s Response shows he paid other debts according to the repayment \nschedule or in full.  The credit reports attached to his Response contain the comments \nabout his repayments on schedule. Those debts are not at issue in the SOR, but do \nshow Applicant has paid debts in a timely manner.  He did borrow $9,890 on a signature \nloan in February 2007, to purchase a \u201c4-wheeler\u201d for his ten-year-old son and himself.  \nHe reduced the balance to $3,600 by September 16, 2008, and he contends this regular \ndebt repayment shows his responsibility.  The other debts were credit cards and a \ncomputer purchase.  These items on Applicant\u2019s credit report show zero balances. \n(Items 1, 2, 5, 6; Answer; Response)     \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \n\n \n4 \n \n \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  \nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise \nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated some delinquent debt that he was unable to \npay for a period of time.  He also filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 1999 to eliminate \n$68,000 in debt. After reaffirmations and exemptions under state law, Applicant actually \neliminated about $22,000 in debt.  The evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially \ndisqualifying conditions. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition \nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s \nfinancial worries arose between about 1998 and 2005. He accumulated two small \ndelinquent debts subsequent to his bankruptcy discharge due to his wife=s medical \nissues and sporadic unemployment. His periods of unemployment led to the \nrepossession of one of his vehicles in 1995.  These circumstances are no longer extant. \nHe completed the bankruptcy nine years ago.  I find the behavior occurred under such \nunusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur, and it does not raise concerns about \nhis current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. The evidence raises this \npotentially mitigating condition.  \n \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the \nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a \nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), \nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ As noted above, some of \nthe financial problems arose from his wife=s medical problems, including the medical \nbills.  Other financial problems resulted from the periods of unemployment for Applicant \nand his spouse. He acted responsibly in identifying and resolving these debts. I find this \npotentially mitigating condition is a factor for consideration in this case.  \n \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@ \nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the \nevidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant received legal counseling about various repayment \noptions in 1999 when he was unemployed, and chose to file Chapter 7 bankruptcy.  He \nwas swiftly discharged in bankruptcy because he had no assets above the state law \nallowed exemptions.  Applicant resolved the two other small delinquent debts by \npayment in 2008. He is now more financially sound and prepared for future \ncontingencies. I conclude these potentially mitigating conditions apply. \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nFinally, AG \u00b6 20(e), \u201cthe individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the \nlegitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of \nactions to resolve the issue\u201d is potentially mitigating.  Applicant does not state it \nprecisely in his Response that he has not paid the remaining debt of concern in the \nSOR, the $19,964 owed to a collector for a car loan, because he fulfilled the contract \nand does not want to unjustly enrich the creditor, which are valid legal arguments.  \nAlthough he has not asserted these defenses through an attorney to the creditor \nthrough court action, he does not consider the debt valid because he borrowed $20,000 \non the car, paid $18,000 back under the loan agreement, and the car sale realized \n$10,000.  Applicant would have enhanced his presentation in writing if he had included \nthe loan agreement and information about the sale price of the vehicle after \nrepossession as part of his Response.  Nonetheless, his position is credible based on \nthe other evidence he submitted.  The documented proof is the credit report showing \nthe debt.  Applicant is in contact with the creditor, who wants Applicant to admit the \ndebt, but he refuses to do so because he terminated the agreement, in his opinion, by \nsurrendering the vehicle.  I conclude Applicant has a reasonable legal basis to dispute \nthe debt.  He would be well advised to hire an attorney to resolve this debt by some \ncompromise to remove it from his credit record. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence.\u201d According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  Applicant suffered economic losses \nbecause of unemployment at various times.  Applicant was an adult and married when \nthese economic woes befell him.  He used a legal process, the Federal bankruptcy law, \nto eliminate about $22,000 in debt after keeping his mobile home and one car in 1999.  \nHe has shown he has not accumulated additional debt during the past nine years which \nhe has not paid.  He did show he pays his debts, and that both he and his wife are now \nemployed.  He manages his income within its limits.   \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n He has shown, however, that on his other debts and total financial picture, he \nhas learned from his bankruptcy and past unemployment periods the need to establish \nand maintain good credit.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with no questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. Applicant is not a security \nrisk or threat. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the security \nconcerns arising from his financial considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nPHILIP S. HOWE \nAdministrative Judge \n",

On January 22, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) enumerating security concerns arising under\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations). The action was taken under Executive Order\n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as\namended, Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and\nthe revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December\n29, 2005, and effective for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nIn a March 11, 2009, response, Applicant denied two of the delinquent accounts\nalleged in the SOR were hers and requested a hearing. The matter was referred to\nDOHA on April 14, 2009, and the case was assigned to me that day. Department\nCounsel and Applicant agreed to a hearing date of April 30, 2009. A Notice of Hearing\nwas issued to that effect on April 15, 2009. The hearing was rescheduled for May 7,\n2009, pursuant to a May 4, 2009, amended notice. I convened the hearing as\nJuly 27, 2009\n\n Tr. 54.\n      1\n2\nscheduled. Applicant was represented by counsel, gave testimony, and offered six\ndocuments which were admitted without objection as exhibits (Exs.) A-F. Department\nCounsel offered four documents admitted as Exs. 1-4 without objection. The record was\nheld open through May 22, 2009, to give Applicant the opportunity to supplement the\nrecord. The transcript (Tr.) of the proceeding was received on May 21, 2009. Two\nadditional documents were received by Department Counsel on May 22, 2009, and\nforwarded to me on May 27, 2009. They were accepted into the record without\nobjection as Exs. G-H and the record was closed on May 27, 2009. Based upon a\nreview of the testimony, submissions, and exhibits, I find Applicant met her burden\nregarding the security concerns raised. Security clearance is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 41-year-old business manager for a defense contractor. She has\nworked for the same employer for nearly six years. Single and with some college credits\nearned, she has essentially been gainfully employed in some capacity since she was 15\nyears of age.\nIn early 2000, Applicant left her home and relocated to a different region of the\ncountry to work on a defense contract. During her annual physical, it was determined\nshe required surgery for a serious medical condition. The surgery necessitated two\nmonths of recovery before she could return to work. About a year later, she moved to\nanother region to work for another employer. Around this time she started providing her\ntwin sister with financial support. It was later determined that she required a second\nsurgery for a condition often caused by her prior surgery. This procedure required a few\nweeks of recovery time, but posed no threat to Applicant\u2019s finances. In 2005, a third\nsurgery was performed requiring a brief recovery. She assumed all related bills were\ncovered by her health insurer. \nDuring the period Applicant was providing financial help to her twin sister, the\namount of money she sent started out being nominal. Her sister and brother-in-law\nwould then pay Applicant back. Applicant sent money directly from her own pay check,\nthen repaid her credit card account with her sister\u2019s reimbursement. Eventually, the\nassistance grew to as much as $1,600 per month and repayment became protracted.\nThis occurred about the time of Applicant\u2019s third surgery and impacted Applicant\u2019s\nfinances.  Eventually, the repayments stopped. Applicant worried about whether her\n1\nnephew and nieces were receiving adequate care, food, and necessities. Especially\nclose to the young children and getting concerned about their family situation, she\ncontinued sending money until she became overextended financially. At the same time,\nher employer cut salaries on her current project. Ultimately, she fell behind on her credit\ncard bills, although she had sufficient funds for her own day-to-day expenses.\nThroughout most of this time, she was unaware her sister was experiencing a drug and\nalcohol problem. Her sister\u2019s situation worsened and state authorities moved to\nseparate the sister from her children. In 2005, the authorities asked Applicant if she\n\n Tr. 44.\n      2\n Tr. 56.\n      3\n Tr. 49-50.\n      4\n Tr. 57. It was then argued that the primary concern in the case was that the debts at issue \u201chave only\n      5\nrecently been resolved.\u201d Tr. 58.\n Ex. D (Letter of Apr. 13, 2009).\n      6\n3\ncould help. Applicant moved her sister\u2019s four very young children to her own state of\nresidence and supported them for close to a year.  \n2\nIn 2006, Applicant\u2019s sister and brother-in-law joined them. The relatives\neventually moved back to their home to start anew in 2007. Shortly thereafter,\nApplicant\u2019s sister returned to substance abuse. In 2008, Applicant moved her sister to\nApplicant\u2019s town of residence and enrolled her in a substance abuse program. After she\nfinished the program, Applicant firmly told her sister that in the future \u201cthe most I can\noffer them is to come stay with me and I would help them with employment and help\ntake care of the kids,\u201d now aged 15, 10, 8, and 5. In sum, Applicant expended\napproximately $10,000-$12,000 on her sister and her sister\u2019s family.3\nDuring her tenure with her current employer, Applicant has received raises\nannually. She has not incurred a debt for which she could not pay in several years. She\ncurrently has no trouble living within her means. Although Applicant has not received\nformal financial counseling, she now follows the concepts and strategies set forth by a\npopular financial author and speaker with regard to restructuring one\u2019s income. Using\nhis system, she has already created a $4,000 emergency fund and is checking to make\nsure she is totally debt-free with a clean credit report. To her knowledge, her only\ndelinquent debts were those identified in the SOR.  Applicant has a 401(k) plan with a\n4\nbalance of approximately $60,000, a savings account in which she maintains about\n$5,000 in available funds, and leftover income after monthly expenses. Her only credit\ncards are two American Express accounts. She is timely on her car payment schedule,\nwhich currently has a balance of about $3,000. She is current on her mortgage and\nahead of schedule in her payments. \nAt issue in the SOR are five delinquent accounts. The Government \u201cbelieves the\nevidence that [was presented at hearing showed] all of the allegations, with the\nexception of \u00b6 1.b, have been resolved or paid.  Their status is as follows:\n5\nSOR \u00b6 1.a. Telecommunications bill ($682) \u2013 In repayment \u2013 Before Applicant\nreported this credit report entry as fraud, her twin sister disclosed to Applicant that she\ncreated the account for her own benefit. The sister returned the appliances related to\nthe service and agreed to repay the balance personally. It is currently in repayment.6\n\n Ex.

Jan. 27, 1995).\n      18\n5\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions. These guidelines are not\ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these\nguidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process.\nThe administrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and\ncommon-sense decision. Under AG \u00b6 2(c), this process is a conscientious scrutiny of a\nnumber of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge\nmust consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present,\nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nThe government must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in\nthe SOR. An applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to\nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by\nDepartment Counsel. . . .\u201d  The burden of proof is something less than a\n16\npreponderance of evidence.  The ultimate burden of persuasion is on the applicant.  \n17\n18\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\ngovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration\nof the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \u201cThe clearly consistent standard\n\n Id.\n      19\n Id.\n      20\n Executive Order 10865 \u00a7 7.\n      21\n Revised Adjudicative Guideline (AG) \u00b6 18.\n      22\n One debt was successfully disputed as not belonging to Applicant.\n      23\n6\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access\n19\nto sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such sensitive\ninformation.   The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily\n20\na determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the\n21\napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense\nhave established for issuing a clearance.\nBased upon consideration of the evidence, I find Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations) to be the most pertinent to the case. Conditions pertaining to this\nadjudicative guideline that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as\nwell as those which would mitigate such concerns, are set forth and discussed below.\nAnalysis\nGuideline F \u2013 Financial Considerations\nUnder Guideline F, failure or an inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or an\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.22\nThe Directive sets out several potentially disqualifying conditions under this guideline.\nApplicant acquired four of the five delinquent debts at issue while helping her sister\nfinancially.  Previously unaware of half of those four debts, all four remained\n23\nunaddressed until after Applicant received the SOR apprising her of the negative\nentries on her credit report. Such facts are sufficient to give rise to Financial\nConsiderations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability or unwillingness to\nsatisfy debts) and FC DC AG \u00b6 9(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations). With\nsuch conditions raised, the burden shifts to Appellant to overcome the case against her\nand mitigate security concerns. \nThe majority of debt Applicant owed was the result of her kindness toward her\ntwin sister and her sister\u2019s family. While initially misled as to the reasons behind their\nfinancial need, Applicant\u2019s largess was entirely voluntary. The medical bill at \u00b6 1.d,\nhowever, was a medically necessary procedure stemming from her last surgical\nprocedure. She understandably assumed the medical bill had been paid by her health\ninsurer, which was responsible for the bill. Instead, her health insurer failed to pay the\nbalance and a derogatory entry was eventually entered on her credit report. Previously\n\n7\nunaware of this entry, Applicant has since paid the balance and filed with her health\ninsurer for reimbursement. With regard to this obligation, Financial Considerations\nMitigating Condition (FC MC) AG \u00b6 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the behavior\nwere largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation) and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances) applies. \nThe majority of the debt owed was created while Applicant helped support her\ntwin sister\u2019s family. Applicant believes her direct financial assistance amounted to\napproximately $10,000 to $12,000. After a few years of offering such support, Applicant\neventually put her sister into a substance abuse center and firmly informed her that any\nfuture assistance would be of a non-monetary nature. FC MC AG \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior\nhappened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it\nis unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment) applies. \nApplicant has educated herself with regard to personal finances by using a\npopular series of books or lectures by a well-known personal finance consultant. His\nsystem is designed to be done personally and at home. While informal in nature, what\nshe has learned has been employed and has yielded genuine results with regard to\nboth addressing her past debts and saving for future emergencies. Consequently, FC\nMC \u00b6 20(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or\nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control)\napplies. \nMoreover, three of the five debts at issue have been satisfied or successfully\ndisputed, representing a satisfaction of over $16,000 of the approximately $21,000 of\nalleged debt. What remains is a telecommunications bill currently in repayment by\nApplicant\u2019s sister and a credit card collection entity which Applicant only recently\nlocated and has been prepared to pay for the past several months. There is no reason\nto doubt her resolve in paying off that debt as soon as she receives a final accounting.\nFC MC \u00b6 20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts) applies. No other mitigating conditions apply.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2)\nthe circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency\nof the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the\ntime of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is\nvoluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and\n\n8\nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for\nthe conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation\nor recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security\nclearance must be an overall common-sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, as well as the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nfactors. Applicant is a successful professional who excels at her job and has earned the\nrespect of her superiors. She demonstrated exceptional charity and familial devotion in\nher support of her twin sister and solid judgment in guiding her sister to a substance\nabuse program. She also showed both courage and resolve in informing her sister that\nfuture financial support would not be forthcoming. Using a popular personal finance\nprogram, Applicant created an emergency fund, satisfied her debts, and amassed\nsignificant savings. She addressed four of the five accounts at issue. Although she was\npreviously unable to locate the collection agent for the fifth account at issue, her\npersistence recently paid off. She recently located that creditor, negotiated a\nsettlement, is awaiting a final balance, and reserved the funds to satisfy that balance\nupon receipt.\nAs noted by Department Counsel, the main factor speaking against Applicant is\nthat these delinquent debts remained unpaid until recently. To Applicant\u2019s defense,\nhowever, she was previously unaware of the accounts noted at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, and\n1.d, which includes an account entry that was successfully disputed and determined not\nto be hers. Information identifying the company that currently holds the account noted\nat SOR \u00b6 1.b was only recently discovered. While Applicant asserts no excuse or\nexplanation in her failure to satisfy the obligation noted at SOR \u00b6 1.e earlier, the fact\nremains that the obligation has been satisfied. \nMoreover, this process does not employ a system of calculators or timetables to\nrank or prioritize satisfied debts in terms of the duration of their delinquency. Rather, it\nemphasizes consideration of the judgment displayed by an applicant, an applicant\u2019s\nefforts to satisfy known debts, the success an applicant had in satisfying those debts,\nand consideration of an applicant in light of both the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept and the\nconcerns related to the guideline under consideration. Furthermore, this is not the case\nof an applicant who waited until after the hearing to pay off debts before the closing of\nthe record. Applicant arrived at the hearing enlightened through the study of personal\nfinance, with money in the bank, a demonstrated resolve to honor any and all debts,\nand evidence that the vast majority of her delinquent debt is satisfied. In doing so,\nApplicant mitigated financial considerations security concerns. I conclude it is clearly\nconsistent with national security to grant Applicant a security clearance. Clearance is\ngranted. \n\n9\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant a security clearance.\nClearance is granted.\n__________________________\nARTHUR E.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Under Guideline F, the SOR alleges that Applicant owes seven creditors the total sum of approximately $14,050 in delinquent debt. The vast majority of the debt stems from a delinquent car loan for $13,249, and the balance of $801 stems from six medical accounts placed for collection. In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the medical accounts and denied the car loan because he had begun making monthly payments on the debt. Applicant is a 61-year-old security officer for a federal contractor. He has worked for his current employer since 1994. It appears the Defense Department granted him a security clearance in 1998. He has a history of financial problems as established by the credit reports in the FORM. According to a March 2008 credit report, the car loan is a joint contractual liability for $13,249 (Exhibit 5), and so Applicant is not solely responsible for the debt. The loan ended with a voluntary repossession. By March 2009, the balance had been reduced to $5,689, and Applicant settled the account with a lump-sum payment of $1,500 (Exhibit A). Accordingly, the account is resolved. The six unpaid medical accounts for a total of $801 are based on a October 2008 credit report (Exhibit 8).

Acting under the relevant Executive Order,\nDoD Directive, and Revised Guidelines,  the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n1\n(DOHA) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant on October 27, 2008. The\nSOR is equivalent to an administrative complaint and it details the factual basis for the\nMay 7, 2009\n\n The government\u2019s brief includes several attachments referred to as items. They are referred to as exhibits\n2\nherein. \n2\naction. The issues in this case fall under Guideline F for financial considerations based\non a history of financial problems.\nApplicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR was received by DOHA on January 9, 2009, and\nhe elected a decision without a hearing. Accordingly, the case will be decided based on\nthe written record in lieu of a hearing. \nOn January 30, 2009, the government submitted its written case consisting of all\nrelevant and material information that could be adduced at a hearing. This so-called file\nof relevant material (FORM)  was mailed to Applicant and received by him on February\n2\n9, 2009. He replied to the FORM within the allowed 30-day period, and his reply\nconsists of a one-page letter from his facility security officer and a one-page letter from\na creditor. Department counsel, via a memorandum dated April 8, 2009, raised no\nobjections, and so those matters are admitted as Exhibit A. The case was assigned to\nme on May 1, 2009. \nFindings of Fact\nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleges that Applicant owes seven creditors the total\nsum of approximately $14,050 in delinquent debt. The vast majority of the debt stems\nfrom a delinquent car loan for $13,249, and the balance of $801 stems from six medical\naccounts placed for collection.

The loan\nended with a voluntary repossession. By March 2009, the balance had been reduced to\n$5,689, and Applicant settled the account with a lump-sum payment of $1,500 (Exhibit\nA). Accordingly, the account is resolved. \nThe six unpaid medical accounts for a total of $801 are based on a October 2008\ncredit report (Exhibit 8).

Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n12\n3\nPolicies\nThis section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an\nindustrial security clearance case. To start, no one has a right to a security clearance.3\nAs noted by the Supreme Court in 1988 in the case of Department of Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe\nclearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if\nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d  A favorable decision establishes eligibility of an\n4\napplicant to be granted a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-\nsecret information.  An unfavorable decision: (1) denies any application; (2) revokes any\n5\nexisting security clearance; and (3) prevents access to classified information at any\nlevel and retention of any existing security clearance.  Under Egan, Executive Order\n6\n10865, and the Directive, any doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed\naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of protecting national security.\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for\naccess to classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting\n7\nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An\n8\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nfacts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate\n9\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme\n10\nCourt stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.11\nThe agency appellate authority has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s\nfindings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.12\nThe Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when\nevaluating a person\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions\n\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n13\n Revised Guidelines at 13\u201314 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating\n14\nconditions). \n Revised Guidelines at 13. \n15\n DC 1 is \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.\u201d \n16\n DC 3 is \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \n17\n4\n(DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance\ndecision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon consideration\nof all the relevant and material information, the pertinent criteria and adjudication\nfactors, and the whole-person concept. A person granted access to classified\ninformation enters into a special relationship with the government. The government\nmust be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in those persons to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. The decision to deny a person a security\nclearance is not a determination of an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination\n13\nthat the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has established for\ngranting eligibility for a security clearance.\nAnalysis\nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations,  a security concern typically\n14\nexists due to significant unpaid debts. \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means,\nsatisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified\ninformation.\u201d  Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be\n15\nirresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and\nsafeguarding classified information.   \nThe record evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of\nfinancial problems. His history of financial problems is a security concern because it\nindicates inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts  and a history of not meeting\n16\nfinancial obligations  within the meaning of Guideline F. The record evidence is more\n17\nthan sufficient to establish these two disqualifying conditions.\nThe guideline also provides that certain conditions may mitigate security\nconcerns:\nMC 1\u2013the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment;\n\n As an aside, some in the field of personal finance contend that medical debt rarely indicates if a borrower\n18\nis high risk and question if such debts belong on credit reports. See Liz Pulliam W eston, Why Medical Debts\nShouldn\u2019t Count, http://articles.moneycentral.msn.com/Banking/YourCreditRating/WhyMedicalDebtsShouldn\u2019t\nCount, published Nov. 19, 2007. \n Revised Guidelines at 1\u20132. \n19\n5\nMC 2\u2013the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\nMC 3\u2013the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control;\nMC 4\u2013the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors\nor otherwise resolve debts;\nMC 5\u2013the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of\nthe past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides\ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; or \nMC 6\u2013the affluence resulted from a legal source of income.\n \nAll the mitigating conditions have been considered and the most pertinent here is MC 4,\nwhich concerns initiating a good-faith effort to repay.  \nApplicant receives credit under MC 4 because of his efforts to resolve the car\nloan. The debt was settled in full in March 2009. By doing so, he resolved approximately\n94% of the delinquent debt alleged in the SOR. Although he did not resolve the medical\ndebts,  which constitute a minor part of the SOR, his efforts are sufficient to qualify for\n18\nmitigation within the meaning of MC 4. \nUnder the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate a\nperson\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the person\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed in the Revised Guidelines as follows: (1) the nature,\nextent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct,\nto include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;\n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.  \n19\n\n6\nAfter weighing the record evidence as a whole and giving it due consideration\nunder the whole-person concept, Applicant did present sufficient evidence to explain,\nextenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. He did not present a perfect case in\nmitigation by resolving all of the delinquent debts, but it is sufficient to overcome the\nsecurity concerns. Applicant met his ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable\nclearance decision. This case is decided for Applicant. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a\u20131.g:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all the circumstances, it is clearly consistent with the interests of\nnational security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for\naccess to classified information is granted.   \nMichael H. Leonard\nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact DOHA alleged under Guideline F, financial considerations, that Applicant owes delinquent debt totaling $32,547 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.m). Applicant denied the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.d, and 1.l, but admitted the other debts. After considering the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 41-year-old senior systems support technician, who has worked for his current employer, a defense contractor, since November 2007 (Ex. 1). After completing one year of college, he served on active duty in the U.S. Navy from November 1986 to December 1989, when he was medically discharged (Tr. 36). He held a secret security clearance for his duties as an electronic warfare technician (Ex. 1, Tr. 21-22, 27). Applicant was married to his first wife from 1987 to 1990, and they had a 1 daughter (Tr. 38). On their divorce, he was ordered to pay child support of $484 per month. It gradually increased over time to $1,200 monthly as of October 2006 (Tr. 90- 91). Following his discharge from the Navy, he worked for a little over one year as a computer engineer for a commercial company. In October 1992, he married his second wife. They had two children, a son born in July 1994 and a daughter born in August 1996 (Ex. 1). Sometime in 1992, Applicant started an Internet service company with his second wife (Tr. 23-24).

Norman, Esquire, Chief Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP) on November 29, 2007. On July 24, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing the\nsecurity concerns under Guideline F that provided the basis for its decision to deny him\na security clearance and refer the matter to an administrative judge. The action was\ntaken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense as of\nSeptember 1, 2006.\nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on August 18, 2008. He answered\nthe SOR allegations in writing on September 3, 2008, and requested a hearing. The\ncase was assigned to me on September 23, 2008, to conduct a hearing and to\ndetermine whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a\nJanuary 23, 2009\n\nApplicant testified that his secret clearance was suspended for about 30 days by his command for\n1\nbeing late in setting up an allotment for funds to be sent to his spouse, from whom he was separated at the\ntime (Tr. 27). There is no indication on his e-QIP that he was married while in the Navy.\n2\nsecurity clearance for Applicant. On October 14, 2008, I scheduled a hearing for\nNovember 19, 2008.\nThe parties appeared as scheduled. Four government exhibits (Ex. 1-4) and nine\nApplicant exhibits (Ex. A-I) were admitted and Applicant testified, as reflected in a\ntranscript received on November 28, 2008. The record was held open until December 5,\n2008, for Applicant to submit additional documentation. On December 1, 2008,\nApplicant informed Department Counsel in an email message of a contact with the\ncreditor alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.m. Department Counsel did not object to including the\ninformation in the evidentiary record. Accordingly, a printout of the email\ncorrespondence from Applicant was marked and admitted as exhibit J. Based upon a\nreview of the SOR, Answer, transcript, and documentary exhibits, including Ex. J,\neligibility for access to classified information is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nDOHA alleged under Guideline F, financial considerations, that Applicant owes\ndelinquent debt totaling $32,547 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.m). Applicant denied the debts\nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.d, and 1.l, but admitted the other debts. After considering the\nevidence of record, I make the following findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 41-year-old senior systems support technician, who has worked for\nhis current employer, a defense contractor, since November 2007 (Ex. 1). After\ncompleting one year of college, he served on active duty in the U.S. Navy from\nNovember 1986 to December 1989, when he was medically discharged (Tr. 36). He\nheld a secret security clearance for his duties as an electronic warfare technician (Ex. 1,\nTr. 21-22, 27).  Applicant was married to his first wife from 1987 to 1990, and they had a\n1\ndaughter (Tr. 38). On their divorce, he was ordered to pay child support of $484 per\nmonth. It gradually increased over time to $1,200 monthly as of October 2006 (Tr. 90-\n91).\nFollowing his discharge from the Navy, he worked for a little over one year as a\ncomputer engineer for a commercial company. In October 1992, he married his second\nwife. They had two children, a son born in July 1994 and a daughter born in August\n1996 (Ex. 1).\nSometime in 1992, Applicant started an Internet service company with his\nsecond wife (Tr. 23-24). He worked for a succession of several technology companies\nwhile devoting himself part-time to his Internet business until 1998 when it ceased\noperations (Tr. 24-25). The Internet business earned enough to cover its obligations (\u201cIt\nbroke even.\u201d (Tr. 24).\n\nApplicant testified he forgot to file his return in 2002 because he was preparing for deployment (Tr.\n2\n45). The record evidence indicates he was not activated until July 2002, however.\n3\nFrom February 1998 to February 2000, Applicant served on active duty in the\nNational Guard. In June 2000, he began working as a senior Unix engineer for a\ncommercial technology company at an annual salary of about $94,000 (Tr. 29). He and\nhis second wife divorced in October 2001 (Ex. 1), and Applicant started paying child\nsupport for his two younger children as well, at $1,200 monthly (Tr. 39-40).\nApplicant reenlisted in the Army National Guard in February 2002. In about June\n2002, Applicant notified his employer that his Guard unit was being activated, and he\nwas laid off (Tr. 29). In July 2002, Applicant reported for active duty (Ex. G). He began\nto fall behind on several financial accounts as his pay was about $50,000 annually (Tr.\n86), half of what he had earned for the computer company (Tr. 29). He focused on\npaying his child support obligation of $2,000 monthly ($800 for his elder daughter and\n$1,200 total for his two children from his second marriage, Tr. 39-40, 85, 92).\nApplicant was deployed to Iraq as a communications technician for a military\npolice battalion from about April 1, 2003, to July 22, 2003 (Ex. 1, Ex. A, Ex. G, Tr. 31).\nHe held an interim secret clearance (Tr. 32). He was solely responsible for building and\nmaintaining the local area network (secure and non secure) and was designated as the\ncommunication security custodian in the absence of his team leader (Ex. I). Applicant\nwas awarded a certificate of appreciation from a personnel services battalion for his\nperformance from January 27, 2003, to March 18, 2003, in preparation for deployment.\nHe was awarded an Army Commendation Medal for his courage and exceptional\nperformance while under fire on June 8, 2003. After three months in Iraq, he was\nremoved from the combat arena due to an injury to his shoulder (Tr. 35). In July 2003,\nhe was awarded a second Army Commendation Medal for exceptionally meritorious\nservice from April 1, 2003, to July 22, 2003 (Ex. A). He finished out his enlistment term\nby performing recruiting duties (Tr. 36).\nFollowing his discharge from active duty in October 2003 (Ex. G), Applicant was\nunemployed for a few months. He did some contract work but otherwise supported\nhimself on unemployment compensation of about $412 a week (Tr. 42, 86). Applicant\nresided with his parents until June 2004, when he moved into an apartment (Ex. 1). He\ndid not have the funds to make payments on his old debts, including several credit card\naccounts, a vehicle loan, and two loans on which he had cosigned for a now former\ngirlfriend (Tr. 43-44). He also owed federal income taxes for 2001 because he forgot to\nfile his return (Tr. 45).2\nIn April 2004, he began working as a senior Unix engineer for an aerospace\ncompany, earning about $56,000 annually (Ex. 1, Tr. 30, 87). He held an interim\nclearance for the nine months of his employment with the company and accessed\nclassified information during that time (Tr. 31).\nFrom February 2005 to April 2006, Applicant worked as a senior network\nengineer at a significant increase in salary to about $90,000 a year (Tr. 88). He was an\n\nApplicant submits he had only two accounts with the original creditor named in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f, 1.g, 1.h,\n3\nand 1.j (Tr. 56).Available credit reports show the account numbers are the same for the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a\n(Ex. 4) and 1.g (Ex. 3), so they are likely the same debt which the assignee is now reporting has a debt\nbalance of $1,741. Applicant presented evidence showing that the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.c was collecting on a\ncredit card balance of $1,520.80 (Ex. 2) on a debt originally owed the creditor named in SOR \u00b6 1.h. SOR \u00b6\u00b6\n1.c and 1.h are likely the same debt.\n4\nefficient, goal-oriented employee who earned the respect and trust of his coworkers (Ex.\nI). He left the job for a similar position with another company in April 2006, earning\nbetween $92,000 and $94,000 a year (Tr. 89), and was employed there until November\n2007 when he started with his current employer at a salary of $99,700 annually (Tr. 90).\nDue to his increase in salary, his child support obligation increased to $2,400 per month\n($1,200 for his elder daughter and $1,200  for his younger children) in October 2006 (Tr.\n91).\nNeeding a security clearance for his duties with the defense contractor, Applicant\nexecuted an e-QIP on November 29, 2007, on which he responded affirmatively to\nwhether he had been over 180 days delinquent on any debts in the preceding seven\nyears, and whether he was currently over 90 days delinquent on any debts. He listed a\n$200 medical debt from about July 2006 that he claimed he satisfied in about November\n2007, a $680 unpaid utility services debt from November 2005 that he was disputing on\nthe basis that the service should have been cut off when he moved, a $4,800 personal\nloan from August 2004 that he failed to pay due to his military activation and\nunemployment on his return, and $616 cellular telephone and $1,912 credit card debts\nfrom about November 2002 that he disputes. Applicant explained he had given priority\nto paying his child support, but was working to rectify past due balances (Ex. 1).\nApplicant was granted an interim secret clearance for his duties shortly thereafter (Tr.\n90).\nA check of Applicant\u2019s credit on December 19, 2007 (Ex. 4), revealed several\naccounts had been charged off and/or placed for collection.

He submitted a personal financial\nstatement indicating he had $388 remaining after paying his monthly expenses and $25\non the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.g and $50 on SOR \u00b6 1.f (Ex. 2). A check of\nApplicant\u2019s credit on July 22, 2008, confirmed no new delinquent accounts (Ex. 3).\nApplicant has been on a payment plan for about a year to resolve delinquent\nfederal income tax debts for tax years 2001 and 2003. He has paid off his debt for tax\nyear 2001 and owes about $1,235 for 2003 (Tr. 45-46).\n\n7\nApplicant has been current in his child support payments. In August 2008, his\nson moved in with him, so he is no longer obligated to pay child support to his second\nwife. He continues to pay $1,200 in child support for his elder daughter (Tr. 39-40).\nApplicant and his fiancee have resided together since at least November 2007\n(Tr. 93). She shares custody of her eight-year-old son with her ex-husband, and her son\nsplits his time with both parents so she receives no child support (Tr. 96-97). She\ncontributes to the household expenses to the extent that she can on earnings of\n$37,000 annually (Tr. 94-95). Applicant is current in his living expenses. He has no car\npayment as his 1998 model-year vehicle is paid for (Tr. 41). He has four low-limit ($400\nor less) credit cards that he is using to rebuild his credit (Tr. 79). As of July 2008, the\naggregate balance of current charges totaled $756 (Ex. 3). He intends to make\npayments on his delinquent debts until they are satisfied (Tr. 81), which he anticipates\nwill be in a year or so from November 2008 (Tr. 85, 95).\nApplicant has been a very productive worker for the defense contractor. He is\nconsidered a valued employee by coworkers and his supervisor for his skill and\nmaturity. As a senior staff member, he has been tasked with supporting unclassified\nenvironments in addition to assisting with the support of classified systems, and has\nperformed all his tasks in an \u201cexemplary fashion.\u201d Applicant has shown himself to be\nextremely conscientious in matters of security (Ex. I). \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines\nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior,\nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative\nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and\ncommon sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious\nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The\nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person,\npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the\ngovernment must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and\nother evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or\n\n8\nproven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The Applicant has the ultimate burden of\npersuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthat the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7\nof Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national\ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant\nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access\nto classified or sensitive information).\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18 of the\nadjudicative guidelines:\nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nAs of his November 2007 e-QIP, Applicant owed about $20,000 in delinquent\ndebt, including a $5,254 charge off balance from 2004 on a loan taken out for a\ngirlfriend (SOR \u00b6 1.e), and $7,935 on a credit card account with last activity in\nNovember 2001 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.j, same debt). Several of the delinquent accounts\nare from when he was on active duty with the Army. However, the aforementioned\ncredit card debt predates his activation. Moreover, he incurred a $208 medical debt,\n$205 in utility costs, and $677 on a checking overdraft account since 2005 that were not\nalleged but indicate more recent financial irresponsibility. Significant security concerns\nare raised by \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d (AG \u00b6 19(a)) and by \u201ca history\nof not meeting financial obligations\u201d (AG \u00b6 19(c)). \nApplicant attributes his delinquent debt to the loss of income associated with his\nmilitary activation and to his subsequent unemployment following his discharge from\nactive duty. He testified credibly that he was laid off from his job in about June 2002,\nand that he earned about half of his former salary while on active duty. After his\ndischarge in October 2003, he collected about $412 per week in unemployment\ncompensation, which was less than his child support obligation of $2,000 per month. AG\n\n9\n\u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the\nperson\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical\nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly\nunder the circumstances,\u201d applies to the incurring of delinquencies between 2002 and\n2004.\nHowever, neither AG \u00b6 20(b) nor AG \u00b6 20(a), \u201cthe behavior happened so long\nago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment,\u201d can be fully applied in mitigation. Applicant has been gainfully employed\nsince February 2005 at an annual salary of at least $90,000. Even with a rather sizeable\nchild support obligation, which increased from $2,000 to $2,400 per month as of\nOctober 2006, Applicant\u2019s income should have been sufficient to cover a minor $208\nmedical bill incurred in 2005, and to avoid checking overdraft charges of $677.\nApparently, he has had to make payments for the past year on delinquent federal taxes\nfor 2001 and 2003. But the impact of those payments on his finances is unclear.\nApplicant has not adequately demonstrated that these newer delinquencies were due to\nfactors outside of his control, or that he took timely steps to address his older past due\nbalances. Applicant\u2019s disclosure of some debts on his e-QIP reflects favorably on his\ncandor and trustworthiness, but it also indicates some knowledge of outstanding\nbalances. Apart from pursuing a dismissal of the claim for the wireless phone debt (not\nalleged), he made little effort to resolve his debts until 2008.\nSince he applied for his security clearance, however, Applicant has satisfied or\nsettled those debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.i (duplicated in \u00b6 1.k), and \u00b6 1.l, and about $1,110\nin other debt (medical, utility, checking overdraft) that was not alleged. He also arranged\nto make monthly payments on the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a (duplicated in \u00b6 1.g), \u00b6 1.c\n(duplicated in \u00b6 1.h), \u00b6 1.e, and \u00b6 1.f (duplicated in \u00b6 1.j) on terms accepted by his\ncreditors.  As reflected in his response to interrogatories, Applicant claimed at that time\nto be making monthly payments of $25 each on the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.c, and\n$50 on SOR \u00b6 1.f. Available records show his first $50 payment on SOR \u00b6 1.f was made\nsometime after June 10, 2008. The creditor collecting the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c notified\nApplicant on May 27, 2008, that his promised payment of $25 was due on or before\nJune 11, 2008. There is no indication that he made a payment on the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e\nbefore his $100 payment on September 25, 2008. Applicant did not submit\ndocumentation proving he has continued to make the monthly payments promised to\nthe creditors in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, 1.e, and 1.f, but documentation showing satisfaction of\nother debts, including SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.i, and 1.l, lead me to accept his claims of ongoing\nrepayment. Albeit recent, his efforts to resolve his indebtedness implicate AG \u00b6 20(d),\n\u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise\nresolve debts.\u201d \nAs of the close of the record in early December 2008, Applicant had successfully\ndisputed any responsibility for the $607 wireless phone debt that was listed on his\nDecember 2007 credit report. A claim for judgment filed by the assignee was dismissed\nby the court in October 2006. The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.m was also not substantiated and he\nis still in the process of determining whether he owes the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b. AG \u00b6 20(e),\n\n10\n\u201cthe individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt\nwhich is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the\nbasis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue,\u201d applies.\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the conduct\nand all the circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6\n2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.\nThe DOHA Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole person\nanalysis in financial cases stating:\nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the\nconcept of \u201c\u2018meaningful track record\u2019 necessarily includes evidence of\nactual debt reduction through payment of debts.\u201d However, an applicant is\nnot required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each and\nevery debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant\ndemonstrate that he has \u2018 . . . established a plan to resolve his financial\nproblems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u2019 The Judge\ncan reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial situation\nand his actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant\u2019s plan for\nthe reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See\nDirective \u00b6  E2.2(a) (\u2018Available, reliable information about the person, past\nand present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching\na determination.\u2019) There is no requirement that a plan provide for\npayments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable\nplan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such\ndebts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts\nactually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in\nthe SOR.\n\nActions in  defense of the U.S., especially in a hostile environment or dangerous conditions, are an\n4\nimportant consideration in assessing an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 07-00034 at 2-3\n(App. Bd. Feb. 5, 2008).\n11\nISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations omitted).\nAlthough Applicant\u2019s finances were negatively affected by his military activation and\ndeployment to Iraq, he exhibited financial irresponsibility in failing to timely address his\nknowingly delinquent accounts once he secured employment paying him about $90,000\nannually. At the same time, he made sure that his child support and car payments were\nup to date and he remained current in newer credit cards with low credit limits.\nAssuming he is making his monthly payments to his remaining four creditors (SOR \u00b6\u00b6\n1.a/1.g, 1.c/1.h, 1.e, and 1.f/1.j), he still owes about $15,000 in delinquent debt, not\nincluding the $1,235 in federal income taxes for tax year 2003. Applicant anticipates that\nhe will be able to pay off his delinquent debt in about one year.\nAs evidenced by his military service and dedication to his work, Applicant has\nexhibited good character and trustworthiness. His display of courage \u201cabove the call of\nduty\u201d and loyalty to his fellow soldiers in a combat environment weighs considerably in\nhis favor in determining whether he can be trusted to fulfill his fiduciary obligations.4\nGiven the efforts he has already made to satisfy his tax debt and consumer credit\ndelinquencies, he is likely to continue to make his payments to his creditors. He has\nalready shown an ability to adhere to security practices and procedures. On balance, I\nconclude it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security\nclearance for him.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F: FOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant (Duplication of \u00b6 1.a)\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nFor Applicant (Duplication of \u00b6 1.c)\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nFor Applicant (Duplication of \u00b6 1.f)\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nFor Applicant (Duplication of \u00b6 1.i)\nSubparagraph 1.l:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m:\nFor Applicant\n\n12\nConclusion\nIn light of the record in this case, it is clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 57-year-old construction superintendent for a federal contractor. He has a high school education and has worked for his current employer since March 1995. He received a security clearance and eligibility for access to Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) in March 2003. Applicant was married in September 1980 and divorced in June 1989. He remarried in May 2002 and was divorced in May 2003. He remarried his second wife in October 2004 and they were again divorced in March 2005. He has two daughters, ages 27 and 12. He pays child support for his 12-year-old daughter and is current on his payments (Tr. 38). From about 1988 to 2000, Applicant owned a concrete business. Due in large part to his inexperience in running a business, he accumulated substantial delinquent federal taxes. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) records reflect that in April 1996 he failed to file a return; and in May 1997, he was assessed a penalty for underpayment of estimated tax and filing late. He did not keep records of expenses and could not support deductions from income. As of December 2000, he owed $145,180 in taxes, $51,707 in accrued interest, and $15,755 in accrued penalties (GX 7 at 1). In 1997, Applicant negotiated a payment plan with the IRS, providing for monthly payments of $100 until 2007, and he complied with that agreement (Tr. 43-44; GX 7 at 1; AX F at 3). A federal tax lien was filed against him in November 2003 for $141,072 (Enclosure 6 to GX 2; GX 3 at 2",

Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on October 5, 2006. On \nOctober 7, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny his \napplication, citing security concerns under Guideline F. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on \nDecember 29, 2005.  \n \n \nApplicant received the SOR on October 14, 2008; answered it on November 3, \n2008; and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. DOHA received the \nFebruary 13, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \nrequest on November 6, 2008. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on \nNovember 26, 2008, and the case was assigned to me on December 4, 2008. DOHA \nissued a notice of hearing on December 29, 2008, scheduling the hearing for January \n14, 2009. On January 9, 2009, DOHA issued an amended notice of hearing, changing \nthe hearing date from January 14 to January 13. I convened the hearing as \nrescheduled, with Applicant\u2019s agreement (Tr. 23). Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through \n7 were admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf, \npresented the testimony of one witness, and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A \nthrough C, which were admitted without objection. I granted Applicant\u2019s request to keep \nthe record open to enable him to submit additional documentary evidence. He timely \nsubmitted AX D through H, which were admitted without objection (Hearing Exhibit I). \nDOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on January 27, 2009. The record closed on January \n30, 2009. \n \nAmendment of SOR \n \n \nOn my own motion, and without objection from either party, I amended the SOR \nto correctly reflect Applicant\u2019s middle name (Tr. 35). The amendment is handwritten on \nthe SOR. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 57-year-old construction superintendent for a federal contractor. \nHe has a high school education and has worked for his current employer since March \n1995. He received a security clearance and eligibility for access to Sensitive \nCompartmented Information (SCI) in March 2003.  \n \n \nApplicant was married in September 1980 and divorced in June 1989. He \nremarried in May 2002 and was divorced in May 2003. He remarried his second wife in \nOctober 2004 and they were again divorced in March 2005. He has two daughters, \nages 27 and 12. He pays child support for his 12-year-old daughter and is current on his \npayments (Tr. 38). \n \n \nFrom about 1988 to 2000, Applicant owned a concrete business. Due in large \npart to his inexperience in running a business, he accumulated substantial delinquent \nfederal taxes. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) records reflect that in April 1996 he failed \nto file a return; and in May 1997, he was assessed a penalty for underpayment of \nestimated tax and filing late. He did not keep records of expenses and could not support \ndeductions from income. As of December 2000, he owed $145,180 in taxes, $51,707 in \naccrued interest, and $15,755 in accrued penalties (GX 7 at 1).  \n \nIn 1997, Applicant negotiated a payment plan with the IRS, providing for monthly \npayments of $100 until 2007, and he complied with that agreement (Tr. 43-44; GX 7 at \n1; AX F at 3). A federal tax lien was filed against him in November 2003 for $141,072 \n(Enclosure 6 to GX 2; GX 3 at 2). The lien was released on October 30, 2008 (AX B). \n\n \n3 \n \n \nThe release recites that Applicant \u201chas satisfied the taxes listed below and all statutory \nadditions.\u201d \n \n \nApplicant placed a fraud alert on his credit record after suspecting that his ex-\nwife had incurred debts in his name (AX C, Personal Profile at 1). He disputed several \ndebts on his credit bureau report (CBR) and the debts were deleted (CBR attached to \nanswer to SOR).  \n \n \nThe medical debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h, 1.k, and 1.j arose when Applicant \nreceived several surgical treatments on his neck in 2002. He testified he verified before \nthe surgery that the treatments were covered by his company insurance plan, but \ncoverage was denied after he received the treatments on the ground that his condition \nwas pre-existing (Tr. 58-60). He disputed the debts, but all dialog has been telephonic \nand not in writing (Tr. 76). He attempted to obtain written documentation of his \npreapproval for the surgery, but his medical records were destroyed after six years (AX \nE at 1). However, he produced an invoice from his doctor for treatment in August 2002, \nreflecting $17,775 to be covered by insurance and $900 to be paid by Applicant (AX E \nat 2). The invoice shows that his doctor believed the treatment would be covered by \ninsurance. Applicant\u2019s general manager testified that local doctors routinely verify that \ntreatment is preapproved because they want to make sure they will be paid (Tr. 90-91). \n \n \nThe table below summarizes the evidence concerning the delinquent debts \nalleged in the SOR. \n \nSOR \nCreditor \nAmount \nStatus \nEvidence \n1.a \nFederal Tax \nLien \n$141,000 \nLien released \nAX B \n1.b \nMedical \n \n$45 \nPaid \nAX G at 2 \n1.c \nMedical \n \n$57 \nPaid \nAX H; Tr. 48 \n1.d \nSatellite TV \n$311 \nDisputed; removed from CBR \nCBR attached to \nanswer \n1.e \nCell phone \n$1,453 \nDisputed; removed from CBR \nCBR attached to \nanswer \n1.f \nFurniture \n$4,435 \nDisputed; removed from CBR \nCBR attached to \nanswer \n1.g \nGas credit \ncard \n$85 \nDisputed \nTr. 56 \n1.h \nMedical \n$507 \nInsurance coverage denied; \ndisputed \nTr. 58-60; AX E \n1.i \nMedical \n$1,963 \nInsurance coverage denied; \ndisputed \nTr. 58-60; AX E \n1.j \nMedical \n \n$220 \nInsurance coverage denied; \ndisputed \nTr. 58-60; AX E \n1.k \nCollection \n$311 \nSame as 1.d \nTr. 51 \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s most recent CBR dated January 13, 2009, still reflects the furniture \ndebt that he successfully disputed and a collection account that Applicant believes is \nrelated to the disputed medical bills (AX C, Account History at 1, 3).1 Based on \nApplicant\u2019s testimony and the documentation submitted in his answer to the SOR, I am \nsatisfied that he has successfully disputed the furniture debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f, and that the \nmedical debt in this CBR is related to the disputed medical debts in SOR \u00b6 1.h-1.j. \n \n \nApplicant submitted a personal financial statement (PFS) in response to DOHA \ninterrogatories on July 28, 2008. It reflects net monthly income of about $4,417, \nexpenses of $2,235, debt payments of $1,745, and a net remainder of $486 (GX 2 at 4). \nHe testified he recently received a pay raise that increased his net monthly income to \nabout $5,200 (Tr. 63), but the expenses and debt payments remained unchanged, \nincreasing his net monthly remainder to about $1,300. The PFS does not reflect any \npayments on the debts alleged in the SOR. Applicant testified he is current on all his \nobligations, including child support.  \n \n \nThe physical security officer at one of the military agencies supported by \nApplicant\u2019s company has known Applicant for 11 years and worked closely with him. He \ndescribes Applicant as trustworthy, reliable, and conscientious (AX A). The general \nmanager and facility security officer for Applicant\u2019s employer testified he is in charge of \nconstruction at all the company\u2019s facilities, responsible for large sums of money, and \nresponsible for security training and enforcement at the various worksites. She testified \nApplicant is trustworthy and has her full confidence (Tr. 83-84).  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s general manager is certified to practice in IRS cases. She assisted \nApplicant in resolving his tax issues and gathering documentation regarding the \ndisputed medical bills (Tr. 85-86; 93-94). \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \ncontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \n                                                          \n1  Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR to allege the delinquent debts reflected in the CBR \ndated January 13, 2009, but he withdrew his motion when Applicant objected to the amendment (Tr. 69-\n72). \n\n \n5 \n \n \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no \nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR.

See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe SOR alleges a federal tax lien for $141,000 (SOR \u00b6 1.a); five delinquent \nmedical debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, 1.h, 1.i, and 1.j); a delinquent satellite TV bill (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.d and 1.k)); a cell phone bill (SOR \u00b6 1.e); a debt for furniture (SOR \u00b6 1.f), and a \ngasoline credit card bill (SOR \u00b6 1.g). In his answer to the SOR, Applicant responded, \u201cI \naccept,\u201d to the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.g, but stated he did not know the identity \n\n \n6 \n \n \nof the creditor and did not know if the debts had already been paid. He denied the \nremaining allegations in the SOR. I have treated his answer as denying all the \nallegations.   \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18 as follows:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \nSeveral disqualifying conditions under this guideline could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying in this case. AG \u00b6 19(a) is raised where there is an \nAinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.@ AG \u00b6 19(c) is raised by Aa history of not \nmeeting financial obligations.@ AG \u00b6 19(g) is raised by Afailure to file annual Federal, \nstate, or local income tax returns as required or the fraudulent filing of the same.@ \nApplicant financial history raises AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and (c). AG \u00b6 19(g) is raised by his failure \nto file a return in 1996. The evidence reflects that Applicant filed returns in subsequent \nyears but either filed late or underpaid his taxes.  \n \n \nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying \nconditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), (c), and (g), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An \napplicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving \nit never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, \n2005).   \n \nSecurity concerns based on financial problems may be mitigated if Athe behavior \nhappened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it \nis unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment.@ AG \u00b6 20(a). This is a compound mitigating \ncondition, with three disjunctive prongs and one conjunctive prong. It may be \nestablished by showing the conduct was Aso long ago,@ or Aso infrequent,@ or Aoccurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur.@ If any of the three disjunctive \nprongs are established, the mitigating condition is not fully established unless the \nconduct Adoes not cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment.\u201d \n \n \nThe first two prongs (\u201cso long ago\u201d and \u201cso infrequent\u201d) are not established \nbecause Applicant\u2019s debts are numerous. Some debts were satisfied only recently, and \nothers are disputed and not yet resolved.  \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nThe third prong (\u201cunlikely to recur\u201d), however, is established for the federal tax \nlien, the disputed medical debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h-1.j, and the fraudulent debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.d-1.g. Applicant learned he was not competent to operate his own business and is not \nlikely to make that mistake again. The disputed medical debts arose because Applicant \nwas informed that his surgical treatments were preapproved, but coverage was denied \nafter the fact on the ground that his condition was pre-existing. He is now more attuned \nto the importance of monitoring his credit record, and he has placed a fraud alert on his \ncredit record. \n \nThe final prong (\u201cdoes not cast doubt\u201d) is established. Applicant acted \nresponsibly and resolved the tax debt. Like many citizens, he did not realize the \nimportance of monitoring his credit record until his background investigation revealed \nthe derogatory information in his CBR. He responded by resolving the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.b and 1.c and disputing the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d-1.g. His financial situation is under \ncontrol. Based on the evidence supporting the third and fourth prongs of AG \u00b6 20(a), I \nconclude this mitigating condition is established.  \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that Athe \nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s \ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances.@ AG \u00b6 20(b). Both prongs, i.e., conditions beyond the person=s \ncontrol and responsible conduct, must be established. \n \nThe tax lien was not due to conditions beyond his control, but rather conditions \nbeyond his competence. His medical condition requiring treatment was beyond his \ncontrol, and his failure to pay the disputed medical bills was due to the insurance \ncompany\u2019s denial of coverage after he was preapproved for the treatment, also beyond \nhis control. The debts due to fraud were beyond his control. Applicant acted responsibly \nby resolving the tax debt, paying undisputed medical debts, disputing the fraudulent \ndebts, and challenging the insurance company\u2019s denial of coverage. I conclude AG \u00b6 \n20(b) is applicable. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that Athe \nperson has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear \nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.@ AG \u00b6 20(c). \nApplicant\u2019s general manager is experienced in IRS cases. She assisted him in resolving \nhis tax debt, and it is now resolved. I conclude AG \u00b6 20(c) applies to the federal tax debt \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a; but it does not apply to mitigate the overall financial concern \nbecause he has not received financial counseling. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that Athe \nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve \ndebts.@ AG \u00b6 20(d). Good faith means acting \u201cin a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.@ ISCR Case No. 99-0201, 1999 \nWL 1442346 at *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999). \u201c[A]n applicant is not required, as a matter \n\n \n8 \n \n \nof law, to establish that [he/she] has paid off each and every debt listed in the SOR . . . \nAll that is required is that an applicant demonstrate that [he/she] has . . . established a \nplan to resolve [his/her] financial problems and taken significant actions to implement \nthat plan.\u201d ADP Case No. 06-18900 (App. Bd. Jun. 6, 2008). \n \nApplicant has satisfied the federal tax lien, paid the undisputed medical bills, \ndisputed the fraudulent debts, and disputed the medical debts for which insurance \ncoverage was denied. The amounts of the disputed medical debts are within his ability \nto pay if the dispute is resolved against him. I conclude AG \u00b6 20(d) is established. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigating by showing Athe \nindividual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is \nthe cause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of \nthe dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue.@ AG \u00b6 20(e). Applicant \ndisputed three medical debts for which insurance coverage was denied. He was unable \nto provide documentation that his treatment was preapproved, because his medical \nrecords were destroyed after six years. He did, however, provide documentary evidence \nthat his doctor believed the treatment was covered by insurance. I conclude AG \u00b6 20(e) \nis established for the disputed debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d-1.k. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(a) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n \nApplicant is a mature adult who has worked for the same federal contractor since \n1995, held a clearance for more almost six years, and is regarded as a trustworthy and \nvaluable employee. Like many citizens, he learned the hard way about the importance \nof monitoring his credit record. He has resolved his tax problems and acted responsibly \n\n \n9 \n \n \nabout the other debts listed in the SOR. His personal financial situation is under control. \nHis current income leaves him a substantial net monthly remainder. If the disputed \nmedical debts are resolved against him, he has the financial resources to pay them.  \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nmitigated the security concerns based on financial considerations. Accordingly, I \nconclude he has carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to continue his eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set \nforth in the SOR, as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.25: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): FOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.k: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is clearly consistent with the national interest \nto continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \nLeRoy F. Foreman \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted her security clearance application (SF 86) on August 3, \n2008. On December 22, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to \ndeny her application, citing security concerns under Guideline F. The action was taken \nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \nApril 30, 2009\n\n \n2\n \nApplicant received the SOR on January 8, 2009; answered it on January 22, \n2009; and requested determination on the record without a hearing. Department \nCounsel submitted the government\u2019s written case on February 10, 2009. On February \n19, 2009, a complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) was sent to Applicant, \nwho was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, \nextenuate, or mitigate the government\u2019s evidence. Applicant received the FORM on \nFebruary 27, 2009, but she did not submit any additional information. The case was \nassigned to me on April 23, 2009.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn her answer to the SOR (Government Exhibit (GX) 2), Applicant admitted all the \nallegations in the SOR except \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.h. Her admissions are incorporated in my \nfindings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 42-year-old regional operations manager for a defense contractor. \nShe has worked for her current employer since August 2008. Her SF 86 indicates she \nreceived a State Department clearance in September 2007, but she has never held a \nclearance from the Department of Defense.  \n \n \nApplicant was married in March 1997, and divorced in September 1999.

In \nresponse to DOHA interrogatories, she submitted what appears to be a voucher from \nthe local Division of Support Enforcement, dated December 19, 2003, reflecting a \nrefund of $35.54 (GX 6 at 11-12).

After the creditor \nrefused to accept late payments from Applicant, the vehicle was repossessed. Applicant \nrefuses to pay this debt. \n \n \nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g arose when Applicant purchased a car and found \nit was defective. When the seller refused to repair it under the warranty, Applicant \nsurrendered the car, and the creditor obtained a judgment against her (GX 7). She \nrefuses to pay this debt. \n \n \nApplicant denied owing the tuition debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f, claiming it was paid. \nShe has not produced any documentation of payment.  \n \n\n \n3\n \nThe table below summarizes the evidence concerning the debts alleged in the \nSOR. \n \nSOR Debt \nAmount \nStatus \nEvidence \n1.a \nCell phone \n$272 \nUnpaid \nGX 2, GX 4, GX 5 \n1.b \nCar repossession \n$14,166 \nUnpaid \nGX 2, GX 4-6 \n1.c \nCollection account \n$244 \nUnpaid \nGX 2, GX 4 \n1.d \nChild support \n$24,646 \nUnpaid \nGX 2,GX 4 \n1.e \nCollection account \n$1,084 \nUnpaid \nGX 2, GX 4 \n1.f \nCollege tuition \n$480 \nUnpaid \nGX 4, GX 5 \n1.g \nCar loan (judgment) \n$8,742 \nUnpaid \nGX 2, GX 4-7 \n1.h \nSatellite TV \n$72 \nPaid \nGX 4 at 1, GX 6 at 9 \n1.i \nUtility bill \n$155 \nUnpaid \nGX 2, GX 5 \n1.j \nUtility bill \n$224 \nUnpaid \nGX 2, GX 5 at 6 \n \n \nApplicant submitted a personal financial statement in response to DOHA \ninterrogatories on August 20, 2008.

She owns a 2001 \ntruck that is paid for (GX 6 at 14).  \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \ncontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n\n \n4\n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no \nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe SOR alleges ten delinquent debts totaling about $50,085. The concern \nunder this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18 as follows:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \n \nSeveral potentially disqualifying conditions under this guideline are relevant. AG \n\u00b6 19(a) is raised where there is an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.@ AG \u00b6 \n19(c) is raised when there is Aa history of not meeting financial obligations.@ AG \u00b6 19(e) \nis raised when there is Aconsistent spending beyond one=s means, which may be \nindicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-to-\n\n \n5\nincome ratio, and/or other financial analysis.@ Applicant\u2019s financial history raises these \nthree disqualifying conditions, shifting the burden to her to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a \nmitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the government. See \nISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nSecurity concerns based on financial problems can be mitigated by showing that \nAthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ AG \u00b6 20(a). If any of the three \ndisjunctive prongs are established, the mitigating condition is not fully established \nunless the conduct Adoes not cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d This mitigating condition is not established because \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts are numerous, not yet satisfied, and did not arise under \nunusual conditions.  \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that Athe \nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s \ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances.@ AG \u00b6 20(b). Applicant\u2019s periods of unemployment were \nbeyond her control, but she has been continuously employed for more than two years \nand has done virtually nothing to address the delinquent debts alleged in the SOR. I \nconclude AG \u00b6 20(b) is not established. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that Athe \nperson has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear \nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.@ AG \u00b6 20(c). This \nmitigating condition is not established because there is no evidence of financial \ncounseling and her situation is not under control. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that Athe \nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve \ndebts.@ AG \u00b6 20(d). Good faith means acting in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation. ISCR Case No. 99-0201, 1999 \nWL 1442346 at *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999). Applicant provided proof that the debt \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h was paid. She asserted in her answer to the SOR that she was \nmaking payments on the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.e, and 1.i, but she presented \nno documentation to support her assertion. She has refused to pay the debts alleged in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.g. This mitigating condition is not established. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigating by showing Athe \nindividual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is \nthe cause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of \nthe dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue.@ AG \u00b6 20(e). Although \nApplicant disagrees with some of the debts, she provided no documented proof of the \n\n \n6\nbasis for her dispute. There is no evidence she has asked to have any debts deleted \nfrom her credit reports. This mitigating condition is not established. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(a) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n \nApplicant is a mature adult, gainfully employed, and earning enough to have a \nsubstantial net remainder each month. Because she requested a determination on the \nrecord, my ability to assess her candor, sincerity, and credibility has been limited. After \nweighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating \nall the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not \nmitigated the security concerns based on her financial history. Accordingly, I conclude \nshe has not carried her burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant her eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.25: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.g: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.i-1.j: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n\n \n7\nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \nLeRoy F. Foreman \nAdministrative Judge \n",

(Item 1.) In his Answer to the SOR, dated October 31, 2007, Applicant admitted 18 of the Guideline F allegations of financial delinquency (\u00b6\u00b6 1.c., 1.d., 1.e., 1.f., 1.g., 1.h., 1.j., `1.k., 1.l., 1.n., 1.o., 1.p., 1.q., 1.r., 1.s., 1.u., 1.w., and 1.x.). He denied three Guideline F allegations (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a., 1.b., and 1.v.); and he stated he had paid three debts alleged to be delinquent on the SOR (\u00b6\u00b6 1.i., 1.m., and 1.t). He denied the two Guideline E allegations of deliberate falsification of answers on his e-QIP and SF-86 (\u00b6 2.a. and \u00b6 2.b.). (Item 3.) Applicant is 35 years old and employed as a senior systems engineer by a federal contractor. Before becoming a government contractor, he served on active duty in the U.S. military from1993 to 2001.

His eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance is denied. \n \nApplicant completed and certified an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations \nProcessing (e-QIP) in November 2005. He also executed a Security Clearance \nApplication (SF 86), on August 7, 2008. On October 7, 2008, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \ndetailing the security concerns under Guideline F, Financial Considerations, and \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nJanuary 28, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn October 31, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR in writing and requested that \nhis case be determined on the record in lieu of a hearing.  The Government compiled its \nFile of Relevant Material (FORM) on November 19, 2008. The FORM contained \ndocuments identified as Items 1 through 8.  By letter dated November 24, 2008, DOHA \nforwarded a copy of the FORM to Applicant, with instructions to submit any additional \ninformation and/or objections within 30 days of receipt.  Applicant received the file on \nDecember 5, 2008.  His response was due on January 4, 2009. He filed additional \ninformation within the required time period. Department Counsel did not object to \nApplicant\u2019s submissions, and they are hereby admitted to the record.  On January 15, \n2009, the case was assigned to me for a decision.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR contains 24 allegations of financial delinquency under AG F, Financial \nConsiderations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.x.) and two allegations of disqualifying conduct \nunder AG E, Personal Conduct. (Item 1.) In his Answer to the SOR, dated October 31, \n2007, Applicant admitted 18 of the Guideline F allegations of financial delinquency (\u00b6\u00b6 \n1.c., 1.d., 1.e., 1.f., 1.g., 1.h., 1.j., `1.k., 1.l., 1.n., 1.o., 1.p., 1.q., 1.r., 1.s., 1.u., 1.w., and \n1.x.).  He denied three Guideline F allegations (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a., 1.b., and 1.v.); and he stated he \nhad paid three debts alleged to be delinquent on the SOR (\u00b6\u00b6 1.i., 1.m., and 1.t). He \ndenied the two Guideline E allegations of deliberate falsification of answers on his e-QIP \nand SF-86 (\u00b6 2.a. and \u00b6 2.b.).  (Item 3.) \n \n \nApplicant is 35 years old and employed as a senior systems engineer by a \nfederal contractor. Before becoming a government contractor, he served on active duty \nin the U.S. military from1993 to 2001. Applicant was granted a security clearance in \n2004. He was married in 2000 and divorced in 2005. The record indicates that he has \nno children. In 2006, he reported an adjusted gross income of $71,667, and in 2007, he \nreported an adjusted gross income of $116,761. (Item 4; Item 5; Item 6, 8-9.) \n \n \nThe delinquent debts alleged on the SOR total $45,960. According to the credit \nreport supplied by Applicant, the debts fell into delinquency between 1999 and 2007. At \nleast eight of those accounts became delinquent between 1999 and 2005. In his answer \nto the SOR, Applicant denied responsibility for a state tax lien of $1,033 and a state tax \nlien of $2,750. Both tax liens were filed against him in 2006. He admitted a judgment \nlevied against him in 2002 for $2,720. (Item 1; Item 3; Item 6.) \n \n \nApplicant also denied a credit card debt of $140 (\u00b6 1.v.) Both liens and the credit \ncard debt were listed as unsatisfied on a credit bureau report, dated July 3, 2008, that \nApplicant provided in response to DOHA\u2019s interrogatories. He provided no \n\n \n3 \n \n \ndocumentation to corroborate his assertions that the two tax liens were satisfied or to \nestablish that he did not owe the credit card debt. (Item 1; Item 6.) \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant stated he had paid the delinquent debts \nalleged at \u00b61.i ($214), \u00a7 1.m. ($370), and \u00b6 1.t ($503).  However, he failed to provide \ndocumentation to corroborate the payments he said he had made. He also stated he \nhad made an arrangement to pay the delinquent debt alleged at \u00b6 1.e., but he failed to \nprovide documentation to corroborate a payment plan. (Item 3.) \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant stated that, in the future, he would pay the \ndelinquent debts alleged at \u00b6\u00b6 1.f., 1.h., 1.l., 1.n., 1.o., 1.w., and 1.x. He stated an \nintention to satisfy most of his delinquent debts within the next two years. (Item 3.) \n \n \nIn his July 28, 2008 response to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant provided a list \nof his delinquent debts that he planned to pay or satisfy within the six months between \nAugust 2008 and January 2009. He failed to provide documentation to corroborate \npayment or satisfaction of those debts. (Item 6 at 6-7.) \n \n \nIn his response to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant provided a personal financial \nstatement.  In his statement, he reported a total net monthly income of $4,386.  He \nlisted fixed monthly expenses of $2,600.  He listed a monthly payment of $900 on a \n$30,000 automobile loan. His monthly net remainder was $886.  (Item 6 at 4.) \n \n \nApplicant completed and certified an SF-86 on August 7, 2008.  Question 28a on \nthe SF-86 asks the following question: \u201cIn the last 7 years, have you been over 180 \ndays delinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d Applicant did not respond to Question 28a. He also \ndid not respond to Question 28b. At the time he completed the SF-86, he was over 180 \ndays delinquent on the debts alleged at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.m., 1.n., 1.i., 1.o., and 1.v.  (Item 5.) \n \n \nOn November 18, 2005, Applicant completed and certified an e-QIP.  Section 27 \nof the e-QIP asks several questions about an applicant\u2019s financial record. Question 27d \nasks: \u201cIn the last 7 years, have you had any judgments against you that have not been \npaid?\u201d  Applicant responded \u201cno\u201d to Question 27d.  He did not report a judgment filed \nagainst him in October 2002 for approximately $2,720. (Item 4.) \n \n \nQuestion 28 on the e-QIP requests information on an individual\u2019s financial \ndelinquencies. Question 28b asks: \u201cAre you currently over 90 days delinquent on any \ndebt(s)?\u201d  Applicant answered \u201cno\u201d to Question 28(b).  He did not report that the debts \nalleged at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.l. and \u00b6\u00b6 1.p. through 1.u., and \u00b6\u00b6 1.w. and 1.x. were \nover 90 days delinquent. (Item 4.) \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant denied intentionally falsifying his SF-86 by \nnot responding to Question 28a. He attributed his omission to mistake.  He also stated \nthat when he completed his e-QIP in November 2005, he did not know the extent of his \ndebt because his former wife took care of the family finances and paid the couple\u2019s bills.  \n(Item 3.) \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \n \nApplicant has not had financial credit counseling.  He intends to speak to his \ncreditors himself and arrange payment plans. (Response to FORM.)    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    Policies \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an  \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, the administrative judge applies these guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \nover-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \n\n \n5 \n \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  \nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise \nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated substantial delinquent debt and was unable to \npay his creditors. This evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying \nconditions. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Several Guideline F mitigating conditions \ncould apply to the security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s financial delinquencies. \nUnresolved financial delinquency might be mitigated if it happened so long ago, was so \ninfrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does \nnot cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \n(AG \u00b6 20(a)). Additionally, unresolved financial delinquency might be mitigated if the \nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s \ncontrol, such as loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce, or separation, and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances. (AG \u00b6 20(b)). Still other mitigating circumstances that might be \napplicable include evidence the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol (AG \u00b6 20(c) or the individual has initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts. (AG \u00b6 20 (d)).  \n \nApplicant has a history of financial delinquencies that dates to at least 2001 and \n2002. His delinquencies are recent and on-going. They have occurred under \ncircumstances that are likely to recur.  \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \nApplicant was married in 2000 and divorced in 2005. Approximately half of the \ndebts alleged on the SOR occurred after his divorce. For the last several years, he has \nhad an income sufficient to pay or settle his delinquent debts, and he failed to do so. \nThe record does not reflect that the circumstances that gave rise to his delinquencies \nwere beyond his control. Applicant has made promises to pay or settle most his debts in \nthe future. However, in determining an individual's security worthiness, the Government \ncannot rely on the possibility that an applicant might resolve his or her outstanding \ndebts at some future date. ISCR Case No. 98-0614 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 12, 1999).  I \nconclude that AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) do not mitigate the facts of \nApplicant\u2019s case. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n  \n \nAG \u00b6 15 explains why personal conduct is a security concern: \n \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n \nWhen Applicant completed and signed his e-QIP in November 2005, he \nresponded \u201cyes\u201d to a question asking if he had been over 180 days delinquent on any \ndebts in the last seven years.  He answered \u201cno\u201d to a question asking if he had any \njudgments placed against him in the last seven years that had not been paid.  He \nanswered \u201cno\u201d to a question asking if he was currently over 90 days delinquent on any \ndebt. \n \n \nWhen Applicant completed and signed his SF-86 in August 2008, he failed to \nprovide an answer to a section of the form asking whether he was currently over 90 \ndays delinquent on any debt and whether he had any debts in the last seven years that \nwere over 180 days delinquent.  \n \n \nThe SOR alleged that Appellant\u2019s responses to the financial questions on two \nsecurity clearance applications showed he had deliberately falsified material facts by \ndeliberately failing to admit and disclose a judgment, debts that were delinquent over \n180 days in the last seven years, and debts that were currently 90 days delinquent.  \n  \nThis information raises a security concern under AG \u00b6 16(a), which reads as \nfollows: \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any \npersonnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to \nconduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, \ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary \nresponsibilities.\u201d \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \n \n \nAppellant\u2019s disqualifying personal conduct might be mitigated if \u201cthe individual \nmade prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification \nbefore being confronted with the facts.\u201d  AG \u00b617(a).     \n \nApplicant denied his answers constituted deliberate falsification. He stated that \nhe made a mistake in failing to respond to the questions relating to financial \ndelinquencies when he completed his SF-86 in 2008.  He further stated that when he \ncompleted the e-QIP in 2005, he was not aware of his delinquent debts because his \nwife paid the family\u2019s bills. The record reflects that a judgment was filed against \nApplicant in 2002, and at least eight debts alleged on the SOR dated to the period 1999 \nto 2005.  \n \nAs a former U.S. service member, Applicant was familiar with the security \nclearance process and the importance of telling the truth to the government. His \nassertions that his falsifications were the result of mistake or lack of knowledge were not \ncredible. Additionally, he provided no credible evidence to mitigate his failure to report \nhis financial delinquencies on his SF-86 and his e-QIP.  Nothing in the record suggests \nthat he took prompt good faith action to correct the omissions, concealments or \nfalsifications before he was confronted with the facts. AG \u00b6 17(a).  I conclude that his \nfalsifications were deliberate.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \n Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant had experience with \nsecurity clearance applications in the past, and he knew it was important to answer \nthose applications carefully and truthfully. In 2005, and later in 2008, he did not make \n\n \n8 \n \n \nefforts to correct falsifications and omissions in his responses to financial questions on \nhis security clearance applications. \n \nAdditionally, Applicant\u2019s financial delinquencies occurred when he was a mature \nadult. He failed to satisfy his creditors even when he had sufficient funds to do so. He \npromised to pay his debts at some time in the future, but he has failed to put forward \nplans which show that he and his creditors have agreed to specific payments at specific \ntimes to satisfy his indebtedness.  His failure to take affirmative action to pay or resolve \nthe majority of his delinquent debts continues to raise security concerns. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts at the present \ntime as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For these \nreasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his \nfinancial delinquencies and personal conduct.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST  APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.x.: Against Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nJoan Caton Anthony \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Glendon, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n__________ \n \nDecision \n__________ \n \n \nRIVERA, Juan J., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant has a history of failing to meet her financial obligations. Her evidence is \ninsufficient to show that she is in control of her finances and she lacks a track record of \nfinancial responsibility. Moreover, she falsified her security clearance application. \nClearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn March 20, 2006, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP).1 On October 10, 2008, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to her, pursuant \nto Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated \nFebruary 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), \n \n1  GE 1.  \n \nMarch 16, 2009\n\n \n \n2 \n \n                                                          \ndated January 2, 1992, as amended, modified and revised.2 The SOR alleges security \nconcerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E (Personal \nConduct). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary \naffirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for her, and recommended referral to \nan administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied or revoked. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR (Answer) on November 10, 2008, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on November 24, \n2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on December 8, 2008. The hearing was \nconvened as scheduled on January 6, 2009. The government offered Government \nExhibits (GE) 1 through 5. GEs 1 through 4 were admitted without objection (Tr. 23-25). \nApplicant objected to GE 5, claiming it was not relevant (the judgment referenced did \nnot pertain to her). I admitted GE 5, and considered it in light of the record as a whole. \nApplicant testified on her own behalf, and presented 12 exhibits, marked Applicant \nExhibits (AE) 1 through 12, which were admitted without objection (Tr. 40). DOHA \nreceived the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on January 26, 2009.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted the factual allegations under SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c, 1.e, 1.f, 1.h, 1.j, \nand 1.k. She denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.g, 1.i, and 1.l. She failed to answer the allegations in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a and 3.b and I entered a denial. Her admissions are incorporated herein as \nfindings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make \nthe following additional findings of fact.   \n \nApplicant is a 50-year-old office manager/receptionist working for a government \ncontractor (GE 1). She married her husband in 1981, they separated in 1989, and were \ndivorced in 1993. Applicant and her ex-husband got back together in 1995, but they \nnever remarried. He died suddenly in December 2007 (Answer). Applicant has a 22-\nyear-old son of this marriage. She attended college from 2004 to 2008, and received \nher bachelor\u2019s degree in management in June 2008 (Tr. 6). \n \nApplicant\u2019s work history shows she has been continuously employed from \nSeptember 1988 to the present, except for two periods of unemployment. She was \nunemployed from October 2003 to July 2004 and from October 2005 to December 2005 \n(GE 1, Tr. 47-53). She testified she was underemployed from 1988 to February 2006, \nwhen she was hired by her current employer, a government contractor. She believes \nshe received access to classified information around 2005, but by the time her security \n \n \n2  On Aug. 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a memorandum \ndirecting application of revised Adjudicative Guideline to all adjudications and other determinations made \nunder the Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program \n(Regulation), dated Jan. 1987, as amended, in which the SOR was issued on or after Sep. 1, 2006.  \n \n\n \n \n3 \n \nclearance was granted she had left her employment. She has never handled classified \ninformation. \n \nShe testified that her unemployment from October 2003 to July 2004, did not \naffect her financially (Tr. 53). In October 2005, she quit her job after realizing she was \nnot qualified for the position. She was unemployed from October 2005 to December \n2005 (GE 1, Tr. 47-53). Applicant claimed that around October 2005, her husband \nbroke a leg while working as an independent contractor (carpenter), and was \nunemployed for two months. He had no insurance and she had to assume all the \nfinancial responsibility for the household. In November 2005, she broke her elbow and \nthat injury limited her ability to work. She also claimed her son had an accident on or \nabout 2005-2006. She attributed her current financial problems to this period of \nunemployment, underemployment, and adverse circumstances.  \n \n \nIn 2006, as part of her hiring process, Applicant submitted a security clearance \napplication in which she stated having no unpaid judgments and no debts over 180 days \ndelinquent during the last seven years. She also stated that at the time she filled out the \ne-QIP, she had no debts over 90 days delinquent. Applicant\u2019s background investigation \naddressed her financial situation and included the review of her e-QIP; her response to \nDOHA interrogatories (GE 2); two credit bureau reports (CBRs) (GEs 3 & 4); and a \nLexisNexis report about an April 1995 judgment (GE 5).  \n \nThe SOR alleges 12 delinquent/charged off accounts totaling approximately \n$54,000. Applicant admitted most of the debts alleged in SOR are her debts and have \nbeen delinquent for many years. Applicant explained that during the last five years she \nhas had financial problems which were caused by a combination of factors; i.e., two \nperiods of unemployment and her underemployment; her husband being out of work \nbecause of an accident; she was not able to work because of a broken elbow; and the \nexpenses associated with her eviction from her mother\u2019s home by her sister (Tr. 42-43). \nUp until she was hired by her current employer, Applicant claimed she did not have the \nmoney to pay her delinquent debts and to pay for her day-to-day living expenses. She \nonly had enough money to survive and to pay for her college education (Tr. 43). \n \nConsidering the record as a whole I find SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.e alleged the same \ndebt in collection by different collection agencies (Tr. 77).  \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.d alleged the same debt in collection by different collection \nagencies (Tr. 76). It alleged a judgment entered against Applicant around June 2008 \nwhich is still outstanding. She opened a retail store credit account in 2005, charged \nmerchandise to it, and stopped making payments in 2005-2006 (Tr. 67). The debt went \ninto collection and the creditor obtained a judgment against Applicant. She has made \nthree payments since August 2008 to the collection agency (Tr. 67, 74). She missed her \nDecember 2008 payment because she had to shift her money to buy Christmas \npresents (Tr. 74). \n \n\n \n \n4 \n \n                                                          \nSOR \u00b6 1.c concerns a credit card account she opened in 1996, and stopped \npaying in June 2006. She started making monthly payments of $125 to the collection \nagency in August 2008 (Tr. 75).  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f concerns a credit card account she opened in 2003, and stopped \npaying in 2005-2006. She made payment arrangements with the collection agency \naround September 2008 and started making monthly payments of $50 to the collection \nagency in October 2008 (Tr. 78). She missed her December 2008 payment because \nshe had to shift her money to buy Christmas presents. \n \nApplicant paid the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g (Tr. 77) and 1.i (This was a utility \ndebt that had been delinquent since 2005. It was paid on October 2008 (Answer)) (Tr. \n84). \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.h alleges a delinquent utility debt she has been carrying since 2006. \nShe forgot about the debt when the creditor stopped calling (Tr. 83). The debt is still \noutstanding. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.j is a delinquent debt for a computer Applicant purchased in 2004. She \nstopped paying it in November 2005. The debt is still outstanding (Tr. 84). \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.k concerns an outstanding delinquent debt acquired by her husband in \n2001 to make improvements in their home (Tr. 88). She believed her husband had paid \nthe debt and she forgot about it. The debt is still outstanding. \n \nApplicant disputed the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.l. The record evidence is not \nsufficient to establish the judgment was imposed against Applicant (GE 5, Tr. 88). \n \nApplicant attended college from 2004 to 2008. She borrowed approximately \n$45,000 from Sallie Mae to pay for her education. She had to pay $5,000 in January \n2007 to be able to graduate. She is making monthly payments of $225. She missed her \nDecember 2008 payment because she had to shift her money to buy Christmas \npresents (Tr. 85-86). \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.a alleged that Applicant falsified question 273 of her March 2008 \nsecurity clearance application (asking whether in the last seven years she had any \nunpaid judgments), when she answer \u201cNo,\u201d and failed to disclose the judgments alleged \nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.l. The judgment alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b was not imposed until June \n2008. There record evidence fails to show the judgment alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.l pertains to \nApplicant. \n \nConcerning SOR \u00b6 2.b, I find that Applicant deliberately falsified question 28 of \nher March 2008 security clearance application (asking whether in the last seven years \n \n3  There is a typographical error in SOR \u00b6 2.a. It alleged that Applicant falsified e-QIP question 28, when \nin fact it quoted question 27. \n\n \n \n5 \n \nshe had been over 180 days delinquent on any debts). She answer \u201cNo,\u201d and failed to \ndisclose the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b (same as 1.d), 1.c (same as 1.e), 1.f - 1.h, \n1.j, and 1.k. Almost all the above mentioned debts had been delinquent since 2005-\n2006.  \n \nApplicant admitted she failed to disclose her delinquent debts, but claimed she \nfailed to disclose them because of negligence and not because she intended to mislead \nor falsify her security clearance application (Tr. 41-42, 44). She knew she had a number \nof delinquent debts, but when she was filling out her e-QIP she could not remember the \ndetails of her debts (Tr. 90). She explained she was rushing when she was filling out the \napplication, did not have access to a CBR, and did not think thoroughly when providing \nher answers. \n \nApplicant testified she participated in a debt consolidation/settlement program \nfrom July 2004 to October 2005 that included all the alleged delinquent debts, except \none (Tr. 69-70). She stopped participating because she did not have the means to pay \nthe scheduled payments. Applicant testified that this is not the first time she has had \nfinancial problems. She explained that many years ago, she had financial problems and \nwas able to resolve her financial problems through her participation in a debt \nconsolidation program. Other than during her participation in the debt consolidation \nprograms, Applicant has received no financial counseling. She presented no \ndocumentary evidence to support her participation in either debt consolidation program. \n \nApplicant did not make any payments on her delinquent debts from February \n2006 (when she was hired by her current employer) to August 2008, because she did \nnot have the financial means to pay her old debts and her day-to-day living expenses \n(Tr. 100-102). She was using all available income to support herself and pay for her \neducational expenses. In 2008, she took a part-time job to increase her income and pay \nher delinquent debts.  \n \nApplicant believes she is doing all she can under the circumstances to pay her \ndebts. Her plan is to pay the delinquent debts she now has under payment plans first \nand then address the remainder of her debts. She promised to use any future pay \nincreases to resolve her debts. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s controlling \n\n \n \n6 \n \n                                                          \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nIn the decision-making process, the Government has the initial burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d4 \ndemonstrating, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information. \nOnce the Government has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, \nthe burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \nGovernment. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).5 \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \n \n4  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable \nmind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit \nAuth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \n \n5  \u201cThe Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and \nunfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the \nDirective, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006). \n\n \n \n7 \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly \nabove, I conclude the relevant security concern is under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations). AG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n  \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides two Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions that \ncould raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case, \u201c(a) inability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s history of delinquent debt is well documented in her credit reports, her SOR \nresponse, her response to the DOHA interrogatory, and her testimony. On or about \n2000, she acquired numerous debts which became delinquent and have remained \noutstanding for many years. As of the hearing date, she had 7 outstanding debts \ntotaling approximately $36,000. Additionally, she owes approximately $45,000 in \neducational loans. The government established the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n19(a) and 19(c).   \n \n  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)-(e) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n\n \n \n8 \n \n                                                          \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \nConsidering the record evidence as a whole,6 I conclude that none of the \nmitigating conditions apply. Applicant presented little evidence of efforts taken to contact \ncreditors, or to resolve any of the debts since she acquired them until after she received \nthe SOR. Although she participated in two debt consolidation programs, her evidence is \ninsufficient to show that she has participated in meaningful financial counseling.   \n \nI specifically considered Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition AG \u00b6 20(b) \nand conclude it applies, but only to a limited extent. Applicant\u2019s testimony established \nfactors that may be considered as circumstances beyond her control contributing to her \ninability to pay her debts, i.e., her periods of unemployment and underemployment; the \naccidents suffered by her, her husband, and her son; and her eviction from her mother\u2019s \nhome. \n \nNotwithstanding, Applicant\u2019s evidence is not sufficient to show she has dealt \nresponsibly with her financial obligations from the time she acquired the debt until after \nher receipt of the SOR. Applicant has been consistently employed since 1988, except \nfor the above mentioned periods of unemployment. Since 2006, she has been \nmeaningfully employed by a government contractor. Nevertheless, she only presented \nsome evidence to show paid debts, settlements, documented negotiations, completed \npayment plans, or meaningful financial assistance/counseling with respect to her SOR \ndebts. Applicant\u2019s financial history and lack of favorable evidence preclude a finding that \nshe has established a track record of financial responsibility, or that she has taken \ncontrol of her financial situation. Considering the record as a whole, I find she is \nfinancially overextended. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nUnder Guideline E, the security concern is that conduct involving questionable \njudgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and \nability to protect classified information. AG \u00b6 15.  \n \nApplicant did not omit information in her answer to questions 27 of her security \nclearance application. The judgment alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.a (also alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b) \n \n6  See ISCR Case No. 03-02374 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 26, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-22173 at \n4 (App. Bd. May 26, 2004)). When making a recency analysis for AG \u00b6 20(a), all debts are considered as \na whole. \n\n \n \n9 \n \nwas not imposed until June 2008. There record evidence fails to show the judgment \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.l pertains to Applicant. I find for Applicant in SOR \u00b6 2.a. \n \nApplicant omitted relevant information in her answers to question 28 of her \nsecurity clearance application. Considering the record as a whole, I find Applicant \ndeliberately failed to disclose the debts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b (same as 1.d), 1.c \n(same as 1.e), 1.f - 1.h, 1.j, and 1.k. She acquired these debts and stopped paying them \nwhen she quit her job and was unemployed for two months. Almost all the above \nmentioned debts have been delinquent since 2005-2006. She claimed that all but one of \nthese debts were included in a debt consolidation program she participated in until \nOctober-December 2005. She submitted her security clearance application in March \n2006. She clearly must have known about all her delinquent debts when she submitted \nher e-QIP. In light of Applicant\u2019s education, maturity, her employment history, and her \ndemeanor and testimony, I find she knew about the debts and chose to ignore them.  \n \nApplicant knew or should have known the importance of accurately completing \nher security clearance application and telling the truth. Nevertheless, she failed to \nprovide information that was material to making an informed security decision and made \na false statement. AG \u00b6 16(a) \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of \nrelevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire,\u201d applies. \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17 lists seven conditions that could mitigate the personal conduct security \nconcerns:  \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress;  \n\n \n \n10 \n \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or \noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules \nand regulations. \n \n \n \nAfter considering all the mitigating conditions, I find none applies to this case. \nApplicant made no effort to correct her omissions. I do not believe her claims that her \nfailure to disclose the information was due to carelessness or rushing when completing \nher application. Considering the record as a whole, Applicant\u2019s explanations are not \ncredible. I specifically considered AG \u00b6 17(c), and find it does not apply since her \nbehavior is recent and shows Applicant\u2019s lack of reliability, trustworthiness, and \njudgment.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c). \nApplicant\u2019s two years employment with a government contractor weighs in her \nfavor. There is no evidence to show that she has compromised or caused others to \ncompromise classified information. Aside from her delinquent debts (which are a civil, \nnon-criminal issue), she is a law-abiding citizen. She expressed regret for her financial \nmistakes, and since August 2008 she has been trying to correct them. She has paid \nsome of her debts and contacted creditors to establish payment plans for other debts. \n \nConsidering the totality of the circumstances in her case, including Applicant\u2019s \nage, education, and maturity, she demonstrated a lack of judgment and trustworthiness \n\n \n \n11 \n \nin the handling of her financial affairs. Although she established circumstances beyond \nher control that contributed to her financial problems, she failed to deal responsibly with \nher financial obligations until after receipt of her SOR. Moreover, Applicant deliberately \nfalsified her security clearance application. Applicant knew or should have known the \nimportance of the trust to be placed on her by the government. Notwithstanding, she \nfailed to be candid and honest on her security clearance application. Her behavior \nshows she lacks judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and \ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has failed to \nmitigate the security concerns pertaining to financial considerations and personal \nconduct. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n  \n \n \n  \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n  \n \n \n  \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c, 1.f, 1.h, \n  \n \n 1.j, and 1.k: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n  \n \nSubparagraphs 1.d, 1.e,1.g, \n  \n \n1.i, and 1.l:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n  \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:   \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n  \n \nSubparagraph 2.a: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n  \n \nSubparagraph 2.b: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security \nclearance for Applicant. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nJUAN J. RIVERA \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Applicant failed to rebut the presumption that the Judge\nconsidered all of the record evidence in rendering his unfavorable decision.  Adverse decision\naffirmed.  \nCASE NO: 08-05637.a1\nDATE: 09/09/2010\nDATE: September 9, 2010\nIn Re:\n----------------\n \nApplicant for Security Clearance\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\n)\nISCR Case No. 08-05637\nAPPEAL BOARD DECISION\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nDaniel F. Crowley, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nJavier N. Maldonado, Esq.\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On July 30, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a decision on the written record.  On May 10, 2010, after\nconsidering the record, Administrative Judge David M. White denied Applicant\u2019s request for a\nsecurity clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\n\n1The Judge made favorable findings for all of the Guideline F allegations.  Therefore, they are not at issue in\nthis appeal. \nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge erred in concluding that\nApplicant\u2019s omissions on his security clearance application (SCA) were deliberate; whether the\nJudge failed to consider all of the record evidence; whether the Judge\u2019s application of the pertinent\nmitigating conditions was erroneous; and whether the Judge\u2019s whole-person analysis was erroneous.1\nConsistent with the following discussion, we affirm the Judge\u2019s decision.\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant is an employee of a\nsmall-business Defense contractor.  This is his first application for a security clearance.\nIn the late 1990s and early 2000s, Applicant worked with his wife in certain private business\nventures.  One of them was the marketing of a beverage that, while popular in Mexico, did not sell\nwell in the U.S.  Additionally, in 2004, Applicant\u2019s daughter was diagnosed with a serious illness\nwhich took her life four years later.  Applicant paid for his daughter\u2019s extensive medical treatment.\nBecause of his business difficulties and expenses associated with his daughter\u2019s illness, Applicant\naccumulated significant debts, owed to three companies.\nApplicant attempted to resolve his financial problems by seeking to negotiate with his\ncreditors.  However, they were not responsive.  He therefore entered into an agreement with a debt\narbitration company (DAC) to act on his behalf.  His agreement with DAC required him to stop\nmaking payments to his creditors and, instead, make monthly payments to DAC for use in\nnegotiating settlements.  Applicant was aware that, by stopping his payments, his creditors would\nconsider his debts to be delinquent.  Thanks in part to the efforts of DAC, Applicant\u2019s delinquent\ndebts have all been settled.  \nIn completing his SCA, Applicant answered \u201cno\u201d to two questions.  These questions inquired\nif he had had delinquent debts during the previous seven years and if he were currently over 90 days\ndelinquent on any debt.  His answers were not true, because at the time he completed the SCA he\nhad knowingly ceased paying his creditors over a year prior.  The Judge found that Applicant\u2019s\nanswers to these questions were deliberately untrue.\nJudge\u2019s Finding of Deliberate Falsification\nApplicant contends that the Judge erred in his finding that he had deliberately provided false\nanswers to the questions at issue here.  He contends that the record does not support such a\nconclusion.  He argues that, in evaluating the SCA omissions in light of the Guideline E mitigating\nfactors, the Judge, in effect, improperly shifted the burden of production from the Government to\nApplicant.\n \nWhen an applicant denies an allegation contained in a SOR, the Government must produce\nsubstantial evidence of the truth of the allegation.  Substantial evidence means \u201csuch relevant\nevidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the\ncontrary evidence in the same record.\u201d  Directive  \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  In the case of an omission in a SCA\n\n2See Item 2, Answer to SOR, which includes a copy of Applicant\u2019s agreement with DAC.  This document states\nin part: \u201cMoney will accumulate in your account while we work with your creditors, and therefore your monthly payment\nto them will fall behind.  This will show up on your creditor report as missed payments.\u201d  See also Item 8, Answer to\nInterrogatories, which contains a summary of Applicant\u2019s personal subject interview.  In addressing his arrangement with\nDAC, he stated that \u201cprior to the initiation of these payments [to DAC], he was advised by [DAC] to wait one month\nso that his accounts would reflect a status of delinquency.  [DAC] could then step in as the negotiating team.\u201d   \n3See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  \u201cThe applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut,\nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the ultimate\nburden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n4Applicant states in his appeal brief the following: \u201cImportantly, no oral testimony was taken to determine\nwhether Applicant demonstrated the demeanor or character of someone who cannot be believed.\u201d  Applicant Brief at\n6.  Because Applicant had requested a decision on the written record, however, he gave up the opportunity to testify\npersonally.  To the extent that Applicant is raising an issue of denial of due process, we conclude that the record does\nnot support such a claim.  \nor some other document, the Government\u2019s burden of production requires more than merely showing\nthat the omission occurred.  Rather, the Government must present substantial evidence that the\nomission was deliberate.  In evaluating whether the Government has met its burden of production\nconcerning an omission, the Judge must examine the omission in light of the record as a whole.  See\nISCR Case No. 07-16511 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 4, 2009).  \nIn the case under consideration here, Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR contained a denial of\ndeliberate falsification.  Accordingly, the Judge was required to examine the entirety of the record\nevidence in evaluating whether the Government had met its burden of production.  In this case, the\nJudge discussed Applicant\u2019s high level of education (two years of graduate work), his business and\nfinancial experience, and record evidence that Applicant was aware at the time he entered into the\nagreement with DAC that his debts would become delinquent.2  The Judge also considered\nApplicant\u2019s exculpatory explanations for the omissions, contained in his answers to the SOR and\nto DOHA interrogatories, and concluded that they lacked credibility.  The Judge\u2019s conclusion that\nApplicant had deliberately omitted his delinquent debts from his SCA is sustainable.  Insofar as he\nreasonably concluded that these omissions constituted Guideline E security concerns, the Judge did\nnot err in evaluating the evidence in light of Applicant\u2019s burden of persuasion as to mitigation.3 \nRemaining Issues\nApplicant contends that the Judge failed to consider all of the record evidence, for example\nApplicant\u2019s efforts to resolve his outstanding debts, his cooperation with the security clearance\ninvestigation, and what he views as the relatively minor nature of the misconduct at issue in this\nappeal.  However, a Judge is presumed to have considered all of the record evidence.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 09-05830 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 25, 2010).  Applicant\u2019s presentation on appeal is not\nsufficient to rebut the presumption that the Judge considered all of the record evidence.  Neither is\nit sufficient to demonstrate that the Judge exaggerated the significance of Applicant\u2019s SCA\nomissions or otherwise mis-weighed the evidence.4  \nAfter reviewing the record, we conclude that the Judge examined the relevant data and\narticulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the\n\nfacts found and the choice made,\u2019\u201d both as to the mitigating conditions and the whole-person factors.\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43\n(1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  The\nJudge\u2019s adverse decision is sustainable on this record.  \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may\nbe granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d  Department\nof the Navy v.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 62-year-old employee of a small business defense contractor that is owned and operated by his wife. He has no military service, and this is his first application for a security clearance. He and his wife have four adult children, and a fifth adult child of theirs passed away in December 2008. Applicant earned a bachelor\u2019s degree from a seminary, and completed two additional years of graduate theological studies in 1970.

Crowley, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nWHITE, David M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant owed three different creditors over $50,000 in debts that he deliberately\nstopped paying in June 2005 to make them delinquent as part of a program he entered\nto attempt negotiated resolutions for lesser amounts. These debts all remained\ndelinquent when he denied their existence on his July 2006 security clearance\napplication, but have since been resolved. Financial concerns were mitigated, but\npersonal conduct security concerns were not. Based upon a review of the case file,\npleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SF 86) on July 3, 2006.  On\n1\nJuly 30, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement\nof Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security concerns under Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct).  The action was taken under\n2\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February\nMay 10, 2010\n\nItem 2.\n3\nThe Government submitted 11 Items in support of the SOR allegations.\n4\nItem 5; AFR at Encl. 3.\n5\n2\n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended\n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines promulgated by the President on December\n29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after\nSeptember 1, 2006. \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on August 11, 2009, and requested that\nhis case be decided by an administrative judge on the written record without a hearing.3\nDepartment Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written case on November 6, 2009. A\ncomplete copy of the File of Relevant Material (FORM)  was provided to Applicant, and\n4\nhe was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation,\nextenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of his receipt of the FORM. \nApplicant signed the document acknowledging receipt of his copy of the FORM\non November 13, 2009, and returned it to DOHA. He submitted further evidence and\ncomments in response to the FORM on December 29, 2009, after requesting and\nreceiving an extension of the response deadline until December 31, 2009. Department\nCounsel received Applicant\u2019s FORM response (AFR) on January 6, 2009, and included\nit in the record with a memorandum of the same date in which he expressed no\nobjection to its consideration. I received the case assignment on January 20, 2009.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 62-year-old employee of a small business defense contractor that\nis owned and operated by his wife. He has no military service, and this is his first\napplication for a security clearance. He and his wife have four adult children, and a fifth\nadult child of theirs passed away in December 2008. Applicant earned a bachelor\u2019s\ndegree from a seminary, and completed two additional years of graduate theological\nstudies in 1970. He also earned a college Registered Executive Housekeeping degree\nand is an authorized bilingual OSHA trainer.  In his response to the SOR, he formally\n5\nadmitted the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.a, and denied the remaining allegations with\nexplanations. Applicant\u2019s admissions, including his responses to the SOR, to the\nFORM, and to DOHA interrogatories, are incorporated in the following findings.\nApplicant\u2019s wife\u2019s primary business is providing janitorial services, some of which\nare performed under contract to the Government. He worked as a city Management\nInformation Systems Manager for two years, and for the Federal Social Security\nAdministration for seven years. In 1997, he left Federal employment to assist his wife\nwith managing her business. In 2000 his wife created another company to begin\nimporting and selling a traditional Mexican alcohol product that was produced and sold\n\nItem 8; Item 10; AFR at Encl. 1, 3 and 4.\n6\nItem 6; Item 12; FORM at 6-7.\n7\nItem 2.\n8\nItem 8; Item 12.\n9\n3\nby her brother in Mexico. Applicant worked for both of his wife\u2019s companies without\ndirect remuneration. He used all of his financial resources in starting up the new\nbusiness over the next four years, investing about $200,000 and accumulating over\n$50,000 in credit card debt. The product, which is relatively unknown in the United\nStates, did not sell as well as they hoped, and they were unable to pay this debt on the\nagreed terms. In 2004, their 22-year-old daughter was diagnosed with a serious\ndisease, which ultimately caused her death in 2008. They had no health insurance, so\nthe medical expenses placed an additional financial burden on them. Moreover,\nApplicant had to spend considerable time assisting their daughter with medical\nappointments and procedures so he could no longer work on the alcohol importing\nbusiness that was ultimately abandoned.  \n6\nApplicant unsuccessfully attempted to renegotiate credit terms with the three\ncompanies to whom he owed $33,675; $15,337; and $15,768; respectively, by the time\nhe made his last payments to them in May 2005. The $35,102 debt, which was reduced\nto judgment in 2007 as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b, involved two separate accounts owed to\nthe first creditor. They were originally charged off in the amounts of $8,794 and\n$24,881. Department Counsel conceded that the $8,794 debt, alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a,\nwas part of the $35,102 judgment debt.   \n7\nIn June 2005, Applicant entered an agreement with a debt arbitration company to\nact on his behalf in negotiating resolution of the debts for less than the full amounts\nowed. This agreement called for him to stop all payments to the creditors and make\nmonthly payments to the arbitration company for use in paying negotiated settlements\nafter the debts became delinquent. He acknowledged that he understood the creditors\nwould consider the debts to be delinquent and were not obligated to deal with the\narbitration company on his behalf. Per the agreement, Applicant made no further\npayments to the three creditors, and began monthly $650 payments to the arbitration\ncompany in July 2005.8\nIn June 2006, the arbitration company succeeded in negotiating a settlement of\nthe $15,768 debt, alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.a(3), for $8,455 (plus a $2,121 fee to the\ncompany). Applicant completed making payments under this settlement in April 2007.9\nThe company advised Applicant in an August 3, 2006, letter that the creditor holding the\ntwo accounts that were later reduced to judgment would not deal with them, and\nrecommended that he retain an attorney to deal with the pending lawsuit. He did so on\nSeptember 11, 2006. Applicant followed his attorney\u2019s advice and terminated his\nparticipation in the debt arbitration agreement in early March 2007, to permit\naccumulation of funds for the attorney\u2019s use in resolving his other debts. The attorney\n\nItem 2; Item 8.\n10\nItem 14; Item 15; AFR at Encl. 5. \n11\nItem 14; AFR at Encl. 5.\n12\nItem 5. \n13\n4\nnegotiated a settlement of the $15,337 debt, alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.a(2), during April 2009\nfor $2,301.  In September 2009, the attorney also succeeded in negotiating settlement\n10\nof the $35,102 judgment debt for $31,200, which Applicant paid in October 2009 after\nrefinancing their home to obtain the funds. The creditor executed a Release of\nJudgement Lien form on October 23, 2009, and provided Applicant with the original\ndocument to file with the court demonstrating his satisfaction of the judgment.11\nAccordingly, all delinquent debts alleged in the SOR have now been satisfied.\nApplicant submitted his joint Federal income tax returns for 2006, 2007, and\n2008, showing family adjusted gross incomes of $19,187; $47,708; and $38,209;\nrespectively. He also submitted a joint financial statement dated December 2, 2009,\nreflecting a net worth of $237,257, an annual income of $70,830, and estimated annual\nexpenses of $40,016. As noted above, Applicant and his wife were found to be\nsufficiently credit-worthy to refinance their mortgage on their principle residence in\nOctober 2009, to obtain the $31,200 needed to resolve his final delinquent debt.12\nWhen Applicant completed his SF 86 on July 3, 2006, he answered \u201cNo\u201d to\nquestions 28a and 28b, which asked whether he had any debts over 180 days\ndelinquent during the past seven years, or was currently over 90 days delinquent on any\ndebts.  As discussed above, Applicant knowingly and intentionally stopped making\n13\npayments to the three creditors listed in the SOR in June 2005, in order to make the\ndebts delinquent and induce to creditors to negotiate resolutions for partial payments.\nIn July 2006, the four accounts owed to those three creditors were all more than a year\ndelinquent and should have been disclosed in response to both questions 28a and 28b.\nThese debts totaled around three times his family adjusted gross income for that year,\nand Applicant was paying $650 per month to the arbitration company in an attempt to\nresolve them. \nApplicant was asked to explain why he did not list his overdue debts on his SF 86\nin response to questions 28a and 28b in a DOHA interrogatory. On September 10,\n2008, he responded: \nWhen I signed up with [the arbitration company], I was not delinquent.\nPrior to the initial month of participation I notified all my creditors of my\nagreement since they had not cooperated in negotiating with me. I had\ncontracted with [the arbitration company] to help me pay back what I owe.\nI therefore, started making my payments the next month as agreed. I was\nmaking a good faith effort to pay. I was instructed by the counselor not to\npay the next month to become 30 days delinquent to trigger the process.\n\nItem 8 at I-70.\n14\nItem 2 at 3. Note, \u201c2(a)(2)(3)\u201d refers to the SOR paragraphs describing resolved debts.\n15\nAFR at Encl. 4.\n16\n5\nThen I sent copies of all the statements showing all the due balances with\ncopies of the letters notifying the credit companies of my agreement.  \n14\nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant denied falsifying the answers with the following\nexplanation:\nRealizing that the credit companies were taking actions that were\nunreasonable and uncooperative and could create a financial hardship, I\ntook the necessary action by enrolling with [the arbitration company] to\nprotect myself, and preserve my ability to live within my means, and\nsatisfy my debts. Utilizing a legal program available to the general public, I\ntook the route that to the best of my knowledge and understanding was\nthe most effective. Further, I enrolled before any possibility of delinquency\nwas created. By 2(a)(2)(3) I have demonstrated that the decision has\nbrought results.15\nApplicant submitted letters describing his good character and trustworthiness\nfrom his wife and several neighbors, friends, and business associates.  I was unable to\n16\nevaluate his credibility, demeanor, or character in person since he elected to have his\ncase decided without a hearing.  \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief\nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially\ndisqualifying conditions (DCs) and mitigating conditions (MCs), which are to be used in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s\noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According\nto AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable\nguidelines in the context of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept.\nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this\n\n6\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201c[t]he applicant is\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the\nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Section 7\nof Executive Order 10865 provides: \u201c[a]ny determination under this order adverse to an\napplicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense\nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d\nA person applying for access to classified information seeks to enter into a\nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set\nout in AG \u00b6 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nDepartment Counsel argued that the evidence established security concerns\nunder four Guideline F DCs, as set forth in AG \u00b6 19: \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;\n(b) indebtedness caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending and the\nabsence of any evidence of willingness or intent to pay the debt or\nestablish a realistic plan to pay the debt;\n\nFORM at 5.\n17\n7\n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(e) consistent spending beyond one\u2019s means, which may be indicated by\nexcessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-to-\nincome ration, and/or other financial analysis.  \n17\nApplicant was unable and unwilling to satisfy four credit card debts and stopped\nmaking payments to the creditors after May 2005. He immediately entered a program\nthat he hoped would lead to negotiated settlements of the accounts for only a portion of\nwhat he owed. He has since reached and fulfilled such agreements with all three of the\ncreditors. DC 19(a) was clearly established from 2005 to 2009, but is no longer\nsupported by the record evidence. \nThis record contains no evidence to establish that Applicant\u2019s debts were caused\nby frivolous or irresponsible spending on his part. The evidence indicates that he and\nhis wife made substantial investments and incurred the SOR-listed debts while trying\nunsuccessfully to expand into a new business venture. To the extent he participated in\nthat arrangement, he is responsible for the debts he incurred. His actions in that regard\nhave not been shown to be frivolous, however. Accordingly, DC 19(b) is not supported\nby the evidence.\nApplicant had a relatively brief and now-ended history of not meeting some of his\nfinancial obligations from May 2005 to October 2009. However, he was actively\nparticipating with the debt arbitration company and his attorney in efforts to resolve each\nof his delinquent debts throughout this period. Some security concerns under DC 19(c)\nare supported on this record, but this is not a case of Applicant ignoring his financial\nobligations.\nSimilarly, the evidence is insufficient to support application of DC 19(e). His\nsubstantial net worth and resolution of formerly delinquent debts do not indicate\nconsistent spending beyond his means. He and his wife took a legitimate business risk,\nlost money on the venture, and resolved the resulting debts. \nThe guideline includes four conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties:\n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\n\n8\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control; and \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.\nApplicant\u2019s financial irresponsibility was relatively recent, involved several\ncreditors, and was largely the result of a voluntary business risk. About $31,000 of his\ndelinquent debt was resolved through compelling two creditors to accept payments\ntotaling $10,756 in full settlement of those debts. The evidence does not support\napplication of MC 20(a). \nApplicant and his wife voluntarily assumed debts they could not afford to repay\nwhen the business venture they started did not generate revenue as quickly as they had\nhoped. While the lack of success was largely beyond Applicant\u2019s control, his decision to\ntake that risk was wholly voluntary. His financial situation was exacerbated by his\ndaughter\u2019s emergent medical problems in 2004, but he did not demonstrate the degree\nto which this factored into his financial problems. He acted in what he thought to be the\nmost responsible manner available by entering the debt arbitration program to attempt\nto resolve the debts he could not afford to fully repay. Only slight mitigation under MC\n20(b) was established.\nApplicant promptly sought counseling and assistance from the debt arbitration\ncompany in 2005 when it became evident that he could not otherwise resolve the debts\nin question. He made regular payments into that program leading to resolution of one\ndebt in 2007, and subsequently to his attorney who resolved the remaining debts in\n2009. All SOR-listed debts are now fully resolved. Accordingly, Applicant established\nsubstantial mitigation under MC 20(c) and MC 20(d). \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nThe following will normally result in an unfavorable clearance action or\nadministrative termination of further processing for clearance eligibility:\n\n9\n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or cooperate\nwith security processing, including but not limited to meeting with a\nsecurity investigator for subject interview, completing security forms or\nreleases, and cooperation with medical or psychological evaluation; \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank and truthful answers to lawful questions of\ninvestigators, security officials, or other official representatives in\nconnection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination.\nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying. The potentially disqualifying condition alleged in this case is:\n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from\nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or\nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.\nApplicant falsely answered \u201cNo\u201d to two questions on his security clearance\napplication. His explanation for denying the existence of his several, substantial\ndelinquent debts was unconvincing. He admitted knowledge of the circumstances giving\nrise to the debts, and to intentionally causing them to become delinquent in order to\nleverage negotiated attempts to resolve them for partial payments. Appellant is highly\neducated, with two years of post-graduate theological studies, and experienced in\nbusiness and financial matters. He knew that he had a large amount of significantly\ndelinquent debt and denied that fact twice on his SF 86. Serious security concerns\nunder AG \u00b6 16(a) were raised by these facts.\nOther than self-serving statements that his falsifications were not intended to\ndeceive the government, Applicant offered no evidence that would tend to support any\nmitigating condition under Guideline E. After careful review of the record, I find that\nnone of them apply. His then-incomplete attempts to negotiate partial-cost settlements\nof the SOR-listed debts that were more than a year delinquent at the time he signed and\ncertified the truth of his SF 86 answers did not relieve him of the duty to truthfully\ndisclose their existence. \nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\n\n10\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.     \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe relevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature,\neducated and experienced individual who is responsible for his voluntary choices and\nconduct that underlie the security concerns expressed in the SOR. He chose to leave\nFederal employment to pursue a risky business venture with his wife that ultimately\nfailed. He resolved the resulting delinquent debts by defaulting on payments and\nnegotiating settlement agreements for reduced amounts. Two of the debts were settled\nfor about 35% of the total claims, and the remaining judgment debt was paid by\nrefinancing the family home. This has alleviated the potential for coercion, exploitation\nor duress from the SOR-listed financial concerns. \nHowever, the deliberate attempt to conceal relevant information about his\ndelinquent debts on his SF 86 raises serious and unmitigated security concerns. The\nrecord contains insufficient other evidence about his character, trustworthiness, or\nresponsibility to mitigate these concerns. A number of people wrote to express their\nhigh opinions of his character, but none expressed knowledge of, or a legitimate\nrationale for, his SF 86 falsification. Recurrence of this disregard for the fundamental\nintegrity of security procedures and requirements was not shown to be unlikely.\nOverall, the record evidence creates substantial doubt as to Applicant\u2019s present\neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude\nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial\nconsiderations. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a and 2.b:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n11\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \nDAVID M. WHITE\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact1 In his SOR response, Applicant admitted a Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharged his unsecured debts in 1998 (GE 11). He also admitted the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c to 1.f, 1.h, 1.i, 1.l, and 1.m (GE 11). He denied the remaining debts. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 38 years old (Tr. 58). He formed a small corporation in May 2008, which obtained a contract with a government contractor in July 2008 (Tr. 62, 63). Applicant is the only employee of his corporation (Tr. 62). He provides services in the field of information technology (Tr. 61-62). His corporation receives $85 per hour, and he works 40 hours per week (Tr. 63). Prior to starting his own corporation, he earned about $85,000 each year for the previous two years working for a different government contractor (Tr. 64, 158-159; AE C).

Murphy, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Kathleen E. Voelker, Esquire \n \n \n \n__________ \n \nDecision \n__________ \n \nHARVEY, Mark W., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. He has \ndemonstrated a meaningful track record of debt repayment. He paid nine of 14 \nstatement of reason (SOR) debts. His two student loan debts were merged. Three of \nthe remaining debts are in payment plans, and Applicant is negotiating a payment plan \nfor his student loan debt. He credibly promised to pay the four unpaid SOR debts and \none large state tax debt. Access to classified information is granted.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn June 6, 2008, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for National \nSecurity Positions (SF 86) (Government Exhibit (GE) 1). On November 20, 2008, the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued an SOR detailing the basis for \nits preliminary decision to deny Applicant eligibility for access to classified information, \nciting security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The action was \ntaken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1990), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nMay 7, 2009\n\n \n \n2 \n \n                                           \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not \nmake the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance, and recommended \nreferral to an administrative judge to determine whether his clearance should be \ngranted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n \nOn December 11, 2008, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed \non March 6, 2009. The case was assigned to me on March 9, 2009. On March 20 and \nApril 7, 2009, DOHA issued hearing notices. The hearing was held on April 22, 2009. At \nthe hearing, Department Counsel offered seven exhibits (GE 1-7) (Transcript (Tr.) 18), \nand Applicant offered 26 exhibits (Tr. 29; AE A-Z). There were no objections, and I \nadmitted GEs 1-7 (Tr. 18-19), and AE A-Z (Tr. 30). Additionally, I admitted the SOR, \nresponse to the SOR and the hearing notice (GEs 7-9). I received the transcript on April \n29, 2009.   \n \nSOR Amendment \n \nDepartment Counsel made a motion to amend the SOR, asking for deletion of \nparenthetical citations to documents supporting the allegations (Tr. 14-15). Applicant did \nnot object, and I granted the motion (Tr. 15). \n    \nFindings of Fact1 \n \nIn his SOR response, Applicant admitted a Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharged his \nunsecured debts in 1998 (GE 11). He also admitted the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c to 1.f, \n1.h, 1.i, 1.l, and 1.m (GE 11). He denied the remaining debts. After a complete and \nthorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact.  \n \nApplicant is 38 years old (Tr. 58). He formed a small corporation in May 2008, \nwhich obtained a contract with a government contractor in July 2008 (Tr. 62, 63). \nApplicant is the only employee of his corporation (Tr. 62). He provides services in the \nfield of information technology (Tr. 61-62). His corporation receives $85 per hour, and \nhe works 40 hours per week (Tr. 63). Prior to starting his own corporation, he earned \nabout $85,000 each year for the previous two years working for a different government \ncontractor (Tr. 64, 158-159; AE C).  \n \nApplicant served in the U.S. Marines from September 1989 to March 1997 (Tr. \n59, 135). When he left active duty he was a Sergeant (E-5) (Tr. 59). He served in Saudi \nArabia during the first Gulf War (Tr. 60). He received the National Defense Service \nMedal, Combat Action Ribbon, Kuwait Liberation Medal, Sea Service Deployment \nRibbon with one Oak Leaf Cluster (OLC), Navy Unit Commendation Medal, Good \n \n1Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits. \n\n \n \n3 \n \nConduct Medal with one OLC, Southwest Asia Service Medal with three OLCs, and \nKuwait Liberation Medal (AE A). He completed various education and training courses \n(AE A). He received an Honorable Discharge from the Marine Corps (AE A). He had a \nsecurity clearance while he was on active duty.  \n \nIn 1998, Applicant completed two years of college and a nine-month program at \na university, earning a certificate for computer information systems (Tr. 60-61). After \nleaving active duty, he worked for government contractors and received a Top Secret \nclearance (Tr. 65). He has held a clearance for about 20 years, including access to \nSensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) (Tr. 65, 134). He seeks retention of his Top \nSecret clearance (Tr. 134).  \n \n \nApplicant married in 1993 and his divorce was final in January 2008 (Tr. 67). He \npaid his attorney fees relating to his divorce, which were approximately $8,000 (Tr. 75). \nHis two children are ages 8 and 12 (Tr. 68). Applicant and his spouse were separated in \nJune or July 2006 (Tr. 67). His spouse had an extra-marital affair and became pregnant \nwith another man\u2019s baby (Tr. 67, 68). He discovered the baby was not his using a blood \ntest after the baby was born (Tr. 68). Applicant received sole custody of his children, \nand is not required to pay child support or alimony (Tr. 69). His former spouse is \nsupposed to pay Applicant $1,233 monthly, and she currently owes Applicant about \n$17,000 in back child support (Tr. 72-74; GE 7 at 10-12, 36, 40; AE D). Applicant is a \nsingle parent; however, his niece who is a senior in high school lives in Applicant\u2019s \nhome and provides some child care assistance (Tr. 69-70). \n \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nOn June 6, 2008, Applicant disclosed his financial problems on his 2008 SF 86, \nnoting he had delinquent debts, liens, judgments and tax problems (GE 1). He noted on \nthe SF 86 that he learned about some debts during the process of obtaining a divorce, \nand he was working with the IRS on developing a repayment plan (GE 1 at 9). He \npromised to generate repayment plans for all of his delinquent debts (GE 1 at 9).  \n \nThe SOR lists a 1998 Chapter 7 bankruptcy (Tr. 87, 135) and 14 delinquent \ndebts, totaling $76,216 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a to 1.o; AE 10). Two debts are consolidated into his \neducation debt, nine debts were paid, three debts are in payment plans, and one \npayment plan for his education debt is under negotiation.  \n \nApplicant and his wife\u2019s Chapter 7 bankruptcy was caused when his wife became \nunemployed (Tr. 88). Just prior to his bankruptcy filing, Applicant was making about \n$33,000 annually and his spouse was making $44,000 annually (Tr. 88). The loss of his \nspouse\u2019s income resulted in delinquent debts, which were eventually discharged using \nthe 1998 Chapter 7 bankruptcy (Tr. 88, 135).  \n \nAfter the bankruptcy, Applicant fell behind on his debts when his former spouse \nfailed to pay their mortgage, student loans, car payments and taxes (Tr. 80). After she \nmoved out of their home, he received phone calls or correspondence and discovered \n\n \n \n4 \n \nnumerous debts (Tr. 81). He also found old, unpaid bills tucked \u201cin a bin\u201d (Tr. 81). The \nsource, status, and amount of his individual SOR debts are more specifically described \nas follows: \n  \n(1) The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b ($1,945) is a judgment. It was paid on November 14, \n2003 (Tr. 114-115; Ex. N).  \n \n(2) The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c ($17,468) is a federal tax lien. This debt is in a \npayment plan. Beginning in August 2008, and continuing on a monthly basis thereafter, \nhe pays the IRS $3,093 monthly (Tr. 102, 103; AE I, J). More details about a much \nlarger federal tax debt and his repayment plan follow on pages 5-6 of this decision. \n \n(3) The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d ($206) is a medical debt. This debt is paid (Tr. 115; Ex. \nO). \n \n(4) The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e ($1,855) is a collection account from a credit bill. This \ndebt is paid (Tr. 115-116; Ex. P). \n \n(5) The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f ($10,825) is a student loan. He was paying $175 \nmonthly until July of 2008 (Tr. 118-119, 164). He stopped making payments after being \ninformed the accounts were being consolidated and transferred (Tr. 119). He was also \nunder some financial stress because he was paying about $1,000 monthly for child care \n(Tr. 164). Four student loans totaling about $26,000 were consolidated and transferred \nto a new collection company (Tr. 118). His most recent correspondence with the new \ncollection company is dated March 31, 2009 (Tr. 118). This debt is in the process of \nbeing placed into a payment plan, and his payments will be about $250 per month (Tr. \n116-120, 163-164; Ex. Q, R). \n \n(6) The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.g ($321) is a telecommunications account. This debt \nwas paid on October 7, 2008 (Tr. 120-121; Ex. S). \n \n(7) The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.h ($428) is a collection account. This debt was paid on \nFebruary 26, 2009 (Tr. 121-122; Ex. T). \n \n(8) The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.i ($3,391) is an automobile loan. This debt is in a \npayment plan with the first $400 payment being made on April 6, 2009 (Tr. 122-124, \n165-166; Ex. U). The creditor advised him that after three monthly payments are made, \na settlement for the balance owed is possible (Tr. 122).    \n \n(9) The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.j ($633) is a judgment from a homeowner\u2019s association. \nThis debt was paid on January 11, 2006 (Tr. 124-125; Ex. V). \n \n(10) The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.k ($949) is a collection account. This debt is part of the \nstudent loan consolidation discussed above in SOR \u00b6 1.f (Tr. 125-126). \n \n\n \n \n5 \n \n(11) The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.l ($4,131) is a home mortgage loan account. Applicant \npurchased a home in 2002 for $415,000 (Tr. 75-76). He is currently about $5,000 \nbehind on his mortgage (Tr. 76). He has made arrangements to pay his monthly \npayment plus some extra through a direct, automatic payment from his checking \naccount (Tr. 76, 126; AE E). His next payment will be $3,700 on April 22, 2009 (Tr. 77, \n166). The mortgage balance is now $419,000 and his current monthly payments are \n$3,064 (Tr. 78; AE W). He is working with the mortgage company to reduce the monthly \npayments, possibly by lowering the interest rate and adding onto the principal of the \nloan (Tr. 77-78, 127). On a previous occasion, Applicant\u2019s former spouse failed to make \ntheir mortgage payments (Tr. 79-80). In August 2008, Applicant and his former spouse \nsigned a quitclaim deed and attempted to end their mortgage payments (Tr. 82; GE 7 at \n13-15). Applicant received estimates on the sale price ranging from $430,000 to \n$460,000; however, he decided not to list the house for sale because he wanted his \nchildren to have more stability and he thought the value of the house would increase \n(Tr. 83-85; GE 7 at 9; GE F). He rents out the basement for $1,000 per month (Tr. 86-\n87; AE G).  \n \n(12) The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.m ($589) is a bank loan. This debt was paid on \nDecember 11, 2008 (Ex. W). \n \n(13) The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.n ($32,518) is a truck loan account. The truck was sold \nat auction, and the remaining balance owed on the debt was paid on January 7, 2006 \n(Tr. 127-128, 165; Ex. X). \n \n(14) The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.o ($957) is a credit union account. This debt was paid \non March 10, 2009 (Tr. 128-129; Ex. Y).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s spouse had difficulty retaining employment (Tr. 91). She was fired \nseveral times (Tr. 91). In 1999, Applicant started his own information technology, \nSubchapter S Corporation (Tr. 91-92). Applicant was the Chief Executive Officer, and \nhis wife was the Corporate Financial Officer and Office Manager (Tr. 92). At most, the \ncorporation employed four employees (Tr. 92). Applicant thought a payroll service was \npaying the employees and sending payments to the government for taxes (Tr. 94, 141-\n144). Applicant\u2019s wife was responsible for completing the tax documents (Tr. 95). \nApplicant signed tax documents for a joint income tax filing, and provided them to his \nformer spouse; however, they apparently were not filed (Tr. 150-153, 171-173). \n \nSometime around 2003 to 2005, Applicant discovered the payroll service was not \npaying the corporation\u2019s taxes (Tr. 96, 138). When he confronted his wife about the \ntaxes, she acted like she did not know anything was wrong or inappropriate (Tr. 97). He \nwanted to file tax returns; however, his wife would not sign them as joint filings (Tr. 98-\n99, 172). Around 2005, he contacted the IRS about the tax problem (Tr. 144). In April \n2007, Applicant filed the missing tax returns for tax years 2000 to 2007, using married \nfiling separate status (Tr. 98-99, 103, 146-150, 172; AE J). He paid a CPA about $1,500 \nto file the returns (Tr. 105). He reached an agreement with the IRS and is making \npayments on his back taxes (Tr. 97). He initially paid $2,000 to a company to work with \n\n \n \n6 \n \nthe IRS on his behalf (Tr. 101; AE Z), and then he paid the company $600 monthly \nthereafter (Tr. 104). Eventually he paid the company about $12,000 (Tr. 101; AE Z). The \nSOR indicates Applicant owes the IRS $17,468 (SOR \u00b6 1.c); however, he actually owes \nthe IRS about $275,000 (Tr. 102). He believes the $275,000 IRS debt encompasses \nboth his personal (social security, federal income, and Medicare) liability as well as the \nbusiness\u2019 liability (Tr. 175-177). He began making monthly payments beginning in \nAugust 2008 of $3,093 to the IRS (Tr. 102, 103, 146-150; AE I, J). He believed that \nonce he had established a track record of good faith repayment the IRS would make a \nbetter arrangement to settle his IRS debt (Tr. 104). He provided a 33-page, IRS-\ngenerated account transcript to corroborate his description of his tax calculations, \nfilings, payments, and other efforts to ameliorate his federal tax debt (AE J). \n \nIn 2007, Applicant also corrected his state tax returns for 2000 to 2007 when he \ncorrected his federal returns (Tr. 154-155). He now owes the state $62,000 for back \ntaxes (Tr. 105, 153). He disclosed this debt as part of his response to DOHA \ninterrogatories (Tr. 106; GE 7 at 6). In August 2008, he made an initial payment of \n$5,000 and thereafter pays $600 monthly, with his most recent payment being on April \n20, 2009 (Tr. 106-108, 155; AE K).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s former spouse was charged with a felony for writing bad checks in \n2003 or 2004 (Tr. 109). She now has approximately nine pending felonies for fraud-\nrelated crimes (Tr. 109; Ex. L). She has a court date pending on June 10, 2009 (Tr. \n110). \n \nApplicant\u2019s personal financial statement (PFS), dated April 6, 2009, shows a \nmonthly gross income of $14,000 and monthly current net monthly income of about \n$10,000 (Tr. 169; AE M). His monthly expenses are $1,910 (AE M). His monthly debt \npayments are $6,933 (includes $3,004 monthly for his mortgage, $3,093 monthly for the \nIRS, $600 monthly for his state tax debt, $176 monthly for his student loan, and notes a \nprobable monthly payment for his repossessed car debt) (AE M). His remaining monthly \nincome after paying expenses and debts is $2,157 (AE M). His only listed assets are his \ncars (AE M). His PFS is unchanged, except he now has the $1,000 additional monthly \nrental income from renting out his basement (Tr. 111-112; AE M). Applicant does not \ncurrently use a credit card (Tr. 130, 167). He did not borrow the money that he used to \npay his SOR debts (Tr. 161). His checking and savings accounts are down virtually to a \nzero balance because of his efforts to pay his delinquent debts (Tr. 168). Applicant \npromised to resolve his debts (Tr. 130-131). \n \nApplicant has not taken a vacation in years, and is very frugal (Tr. 112-113). \nApplicant has two older cars (a 1998 and a 2000 model) (Tr. 70). Both of his cars are \npaid off (Tr. 167). His niece, who assists him with his child care responsibilities, drives \nthe 2000 model car (Tr. 70).  \n \nApplicant does not drink alcohol (Tr. 112-113). He has never been charged with \nor convicted of any felony offense (GE 1). He has never been charged with or convicted \nof any firearms offense, explosives offense, drug offense or alcohol offense (GE 1). His \n\n \n \n7 \n \nSF 86 indicates he has not been arrested, or charged with any misdemeanor offenses \nin the last seven years (GE 1). \n   \nCharacter Evidence \n \nApplicant\u2019s former wife\u2019s sister (S) has known Applicant since 1993 (Tr. 45, 47). \nApplicant and his wife separated in 2007 (Tr. 47). S sees Applicant at least twice a \nweek when they go to church (Tr. 48). S also sees him when they go to each other\u2019s \nhouses (Tr. 48). S babysits for Applicant\u2019s children (Tr. 49). S said her sister, Applicant\u2019s \nformer wife, was responsible for the problematic family finances (Tr. 50). Applicant is \nfrugal with the family finances (Tr. 50). For example, he has not gone on a vacation trip \nfor years (Tr. 51). Applicant\u2019s former wife was not paying her share of the family debts \n(Tr. 52-53).  Applicant\u2019s former wife has a 3-year-old son, whose father is not Applicant \n(Tr. 53). Applicant\u2019s former wife drives a late-model Mercedes (Tr. 53). Applicant\u2019s \nformer wife has legal problems relating to bad checks, a probation violation and a \nfraudulent real estate transaction (Tr. 54). S was surprised at the depth of her sister\u2019s \ndeviousness (Tr. 56). Applicant is honest and very religious (Tr. 54). Applicant is a \nresponsible family man, who keeps his promises (Tr. 54, 55).  \n \nAn Army program manager and senior analyst, who retired from active duty as a \ncolonel, has held a top secret clearance with access to SCI for more 25 years (Tr. 33). \nHe has known Applicant since 1997 (Tr. 34, 41). He attends Applicant\u2019s church, has \nserved on church committees with Applicant (Tr. 35). They are social friends (Tr. 35). \nThey see each other 2-3 times a week (Tr. 36). He also knows Applicant\u2019s former wife \nand two children (Tr. 36-37). He described Applicant as a role model, who is extremely \ntrustworthy and reliable (Tr. 36, 39). Applicant would keep a promise to pay off his debts \n(Tr. 40). Applicant is a very frugal person, who carefully lives within his means (Tr. 38, \n39). For example, Applicant drives a car that is over ten years old (Tr. 38). He \nrecommended that Applicant retain his security clearance (Tr. 40-41). He would not give \nanyone a \u201cstronger recommendation\u201d for a clearance than Applicant (Tr. 42).  \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \nApplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the Applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \n\n \n \n8 \n \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the [A]pplicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, \nnothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, \nin whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, \nloyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has not met the strict \nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a \nclearance. \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the Applicant that may disqualify the Applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an Applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the Applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An Applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security \nconcern is under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). AG \u00b6 18 articulates the \nsecurity concern relating to financial problems: \n\n \n \n9 \n \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n  \n  \nAG \u00b6 19 provides three Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions that \ncould raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case, \u201c(a) inability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations,\u201d and \n\u201c(g) failure to file annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns as required or the \nfraudulent filing of the same.\u201d ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) \nprovides, \u201cApplicant\u2019s credit report was sufficient to establish the Government\u2019s prima \nfacie case that Applicant had [ ] delinquent [SOR] debts that are of security concern.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s history of delinquent debt is documented in his SF 86, his responses to \nDOHA interrogatories, his SOR response and at his hearing. Applicant\u2019s 1998 Chapter \n7 bankruptcy, and 14 delinquent debts, totaling $76,216, were listed in the SOR. In \n2007, he discovered he actually owed the IRS $275,000 (probably reduced somewhat \nnow due to $3,000 monthly payments) and he owed state taxes of $66,000 (now down \nto about $62,000). He failed to ensure his creditors were paid as agreed. The \ngovernment established the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c) and 19(g) and \nfurther inquiry about the applicability of mitigating conditions is required. \n   \n  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)-(e) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n\n \n \n10 \n \n                                           \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant\u2019s conduct does not warrant full application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b) or \n20(e) because he did not act more aggressively and responsibly to resolve his \ndelinquent debts. His delinquent debts are \u201ca continuing course of conduct\u201d under the \nAppeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence. See ISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, \n2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)). Applicant receives \npartial credit under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and 20(b) because his financial problems initially \nresulted because of his spouse\u2019s unemployment and those debts were resolved through \nbankruptcy in 1998. His subsequent delinquent debts were caused by divorce and his \nspouse\u2019s fraudulent activities. His wife lied to him about filing their tax returns from 2000 \nto 2005. He established her misconduct thought divorce documentation and her \ncharges. He receives substantial mitigating credit because his delinquent debts \n\u201coccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non [his] current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d Because of his \nexperience of his spouse betraying his trust, it is unlikely he would trust anyone to pay \nhis bills, especially his taxes, without verifying the payment. He established that two \nSOR debts were consolidated into one student loan SOR debt, nine SOR debts were \npaid, three SOR debts are in payment plans, and one payment plan for the SOR \nstudent loan debt is under negotiation. The resolution of nine of his 14 delinquent SOR \ndebts shows he acted responsibly under the circumstances for those nine debts.2 AG \u00b6 \n20(e) does not apply because he did not dispute any of his SOR debts. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) partially applies. Applicant did not receive financial counseling and \ntherefore this mitigating condition cannot be fully applied. However, there are \u201cclear \nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control\u201d for the reasons stated \nin the preceding paragraph. He understands the security implications of delinquent debt \nand will scrupulously avoid future delinquent debt. He has also established some, but \nnot full mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(d) because he showed substantial good faith3 in the \nresolution of his SOR debts.    \n \n2\u201cEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances \noutside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a \nreasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. \nBd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is \nwhether the Applicant maintained contact with his or her creditors and attempted to negotiate partial \npayments to keep debts current. \n \n3The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant \nmust present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \nsome other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does \n\n \n \n11 \n \n                                                                                                                                            \nApplicant should have been more diligent and made greater efforts sooner to \nresolve his delinquent debts. His actions to date are insufficient to fully apply any of the \nmitigating conditions. However, security concerns are fully mitigated under the \u201cWhole \nPerson Concept,\u201d infra at pages 11-13.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c). I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n  \nThere is evidence against mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct. About eleven years \nago, several of Applicant\u2019s debts became delinquent because more than half of the \nfamily income was lost when his spouse became unemployed. His debts were resolved \nthrough his Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 1998. Applicant and his spouse subsequently \ngenerated 14 delinquent SOR debts, totaling $76,216. He admitted responsibility for the \nbankruptcy and all of the delinquent SOR debts. In 2007, he discovered he actually \nowed the IRS $275,000 and he owed state taxes of $66,000. He discovered his wife had \nnot filed their federal and state tax returns from 2000 to 2005. He failed to obtain \nfinancial counselling. He showed some effort over the years to resolve his delinquent \ndebts, but could have acted more aggressively to avoid delinquent debt, to seek debt \n \nnot define the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the concept of \ngood-faith \u2018requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 Accordingly, an applicant must \ndo more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as \nbankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d \nmitigating condition]. \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \n\n \n \n12 \n \nrepayment or resolution, and to better document his remedial efforts. These factors \nshow some financial irresponsibility and lack of judgment. His history of delinquent debt \nand failure to file and pay taxes raises sufficient security concerns to merit further \ninquiry.   \nThe mitigating evidence under the whole person concept is more substantial. \nThere is no evidence of any security violation. He is a law-abiding citizen. His current \nfinancial problems were caused by three factors beyond his control: (1) his divorce, (2) \nthe necessity to support his two children as a single father, and (3) most importantly, he \nwas a victim of his spouse\u2019s fraudulent actions. Applicant\u2019s spouse was handling their \ndebt payments and she did not pay their debts. Even though he signed his tax returns, \nshe did not file them or pay their taxes from 2000 to 2005. Applicant discovered his \nspouse was engaged in an adulterous affair, and filed for divorce. The family court \ngranted Applicant custody and ordered her to pay child support. Applicant\u2019s former \nspouse was subsequently charged with a felony for writing bad checks in 2003 or 2004. \nShe now has approximately nine pending felonies for fraud-related crimes. Ultimately, \nhe paid or settled and paid all delinquent accounts except for four debts and his non-\nSOR state tax debt. He provided receipts showing that all except four of his delinquent \nSOR debts and his non-SOR state tax debt were resolved through payment of his \ncreditors.  \n \nThe IRS and state authorities seem to be satisfied with Applicant\u2019s payment plan \nof about $3,600 per month (since August 2008). He stopped paying his student loan \nwhile it was being consolidated; however, he has maintained communications with the \ncreditor and promised to make the likely payments of about $250 per month as soon as \nthe creditor is prepared to accept payments. He started making payments on a debt of \nabout $4,000 that he owed for a repossessed vehicle. He worked diligently since 2007 \nto pay his delinquent federal and state taxes. He has ample income to pay his debts. \nThe Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole person analysis in \nfinancial cases stating: \n \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201c\u2018meaningful track record\u2019 necessarily includes evidence of \nactual debt reduction through payment of debts.\u201d However, an applicant is \nnot required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each and \nevery debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he has \u2018 . . . established a plan to resolve his financial \nproblems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u2019 The Judge \ncan reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial situation \nand his actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant\u2019s plan for \nthe reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See \nDirective \u00b6  E2.2(a) (\u2018Available, reliable information about the person, past \nand present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching \na determination.\u2019) There is no requirement that a plan provide for \npayments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable \nplan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such \n\n \n \n13 \n \ndebts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts \nactually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in \nthe SOR. \n \nISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations omitted).  \n \nApplicant is 38 years old. He has achieved some important educational and \nemployment goals, demonstrating his self-discipline, responsibility and dedication. He \nhas held a security clearance for about 20 years. He defended his country in peace and \nwar as a U.S. Marine and then supported the Department of Defense as a contractor. \nHe understands how to budget and what he needs to do to establish his financial \nresponsibility. Years ago, he made mistakes, and his debts became delinquent. His \nprimary mistake was to trust his spouse, when there were signs during their marriage \nthat her honesty and integrity were suspect. He compounded those mistakes by failing \nto act more aggressively to resolve his debts especially his state and federal tax \nproblems. There is, however, simply no reason not to trust him. Moreover, he has \nestablished a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d of debt payments by actually paying all except \nfour of his SOR delinquent debts and a substantial delinquent non-SOR state tax debt. \nMost importantly, he is paying his mortgage, his federal tax debt, his state tax debt, one \ncar loan and will soon continue making payments on his student loan. He credibly \npromised to continue with payments on his debts. I found his statement to be candid, \nforthright and credible. These factors, especially his past government service, show \nresponsibility, rehabilitation, and mitigation.  \n \nApplicant has demonstrated his loyalty, patriotism and trustworthiness through \nhis service to the Department of Defense as a contractor and to the U.S. Marines. After \nweighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and \ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude he has mitigated the \nfinancial considerations security concerns.    \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful consideration of the whole person factors and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I conclude \nhe is eligible for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.o: \n For Applicant \n \n\n \n \n14 \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for a security clearance is granted. \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nMark W. Harvey \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Murphy, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLYNCH, Noreen A., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on November 26,\n2007. On March 11, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\na Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guidelines F and\nE for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant requested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. I received the\ncase assignment on April 16, 2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on April 21, 2009,\nand I convened the hearing as scheduled on May 7, 2009. The Government offered\nExhibits (GE 1-5), which were received without objection. Applicant testified on his own\nbehalf. He submitted exhibits (AE) A-F. I held the record open until May 8, 2009, so that\nApplicant could submit documents. The submissions were timely received, marked as\nMay 22, 2009\n\n2\n(AE G-H) and entered into the record. Department Counsel did not object to the\ndocuments. DOHA received the transcript on May 20, 2009. Based upon a review of the\nrecord, eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nDepartment Counsel moved to amend the SOR at the hearing. He withdrew\nSOR allegation \u00b6 2.a under the Personal Conduct Guideline and a corresponding\nallegation under \u00b6 1.f under the Financial Considerations Guideline. I accepted the\nmotion and amended the SOR.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated March 23, 2009, Applicant admitted the factual\nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c and 2.a of the SOR. He denied the other allegations, including\n\u00b6\u00b6 1.d-1.e. because he was paying on them. He provided additional information to\nsupport his request for eligibility for a security clearance. \nApplicant is a 28-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He graduated from\nhigh school in 1999. He has worked for his current employer since December 2006 (GE\n1). Applicant is currently attending college toward a degree in computer science (Tr.\n22). He will obtain his undergraduate degree in the very near future. Applicant is\napplying for his initial security clearance.\nApplicant is married and has one child. He pays child support for his daughter\nwho lives with her mother but he is not currently under a court order for the support. He\nsends approximately $100 per week to the child\u2019s mother (Tr. 24).\nApplicant had several periods of unemployment. He was unemployed from\nJanuary 2000 until October 2001 when he was in school. He lived with his parents at\nthat time. He worked as a service representative in 2002 and 2003 but had another\nperiod of unemployment in 2003 until 2005 (Tr. 28). He has been employed full time\nsince 2006 (GE 1). \nApplicant\u2019s brother used his credit cards without Applicant\u2019s knowledge for a\nperiod of time in 2005 and 2006. Applicant confronted his brother when he learned of\nthe situation much later (Tr. 42). His brother promised to pay the bills but he did not (GE\n4). \nThe SOR alleges five delinquent debts, including two student loans in collection.\nThe total amount of debt that Applicant owes is approximately $13,031 (GE 3 and GE\n4). He has addressed each debt. \nApplicant presented documentation at the hearing that he is in repayment status\nwith his two student loans which total $4,000 (SOR 1.d and 1.e). He pays $55 a month\n(Tr. 38; AE E). After initially disputing the debt, he has settled the debt in SOR 1.b for\n\n3\n$1,000 (AE A and H). Applicant has paid half the debt in SOR 1.c (AE D). He also has\npaid two other debts not listed on the SOR (AE C). The $1,434 debt to Cap One is for a\ncredit card that Applicant used in 2002. He has called several times and written a letter\nto the company to address the debt but they have not located the account (Tr.31; AE F).\nHe will continue to address the issue.\nApplicant earns approximately $39,000 a year. His monthly net income is $2,800.\nHe has a net remainder after expenses of approximately $900. He is current on all his\nexpenses and his car payment (Tr. 47). He has no credit cards. He follows a budget that\nhe developed after taking a financing class in college (Tr. 45). He is saving money and\ncontributes to his employee pension plan.\nApplicant\u2019s evaluations rate him as \u201cexcellent\u201d in several areas. He contributes to\na high customer satisfaction and quickly establishes customer relationships. He has\nsuperior technical and functional knowledge of his job (AE G).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2,\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \n\n4\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated delinquent debts on several accounts, and\ndid not meet some of his financial obligations from 2002 until the present time. His credit\nreports confirm the debts. The evidence is sufficient to raise these disqualifying\nconditions.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant\naccumulated some delinquent debt and the debt has remained for a period of time. He\naddressed the debts when he learned about them. The debt was in part due to his\nbrother\u2019s actions with respect to Applicant\u2019s credit. This serves as mitigation and\n\n5\nlessens doubts about his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. This\npotentially mitigating condition partially applies.\nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ Applicant was\nunemployed for two separate periods of time. His brother used his credit and did not\npay the bills. Applicant acted responsibly in initiating action to address or resolve his\ndelinquent debts. I find this potentially mitigating condition applies. \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the\nevidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant took a financing class to help him learn about\nbudgets and the responsibility of credit. He has settled or is paying all his debts. I find\nhis efforts are sufficient to carry his burden in this case. I conclude this potentially\nmitigating condition applies.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and\nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;\n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate\ndetermination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must\nbe an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a young hard-working\nindividual. He is going to school and working in the field of computer science. He is\nattempting to build a career. He is married and supports his child. He has good\nreferences from his employer. He has been steadily employed with his current employer\nfor almost three years.\n\n6\nApplicant was unemployed for a period of time and this caused some delinquent\ndebt. His brother also took advantage of Applicant and used his credit and did not pay\nfor the items he purchased with Applicant\u2019s credit card despite promises to do so.\nApplicant took action when he learned about the delinquent accounts. He has met his\nburden of proof to overcome the Government\u2019s case.\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial\nconsiderations. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nWithdrawn\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nWithdrawn\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                              \n_________________\nNOREEN A. LYNCH\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On December 22, 2008, DOHA \nissued a notice of hearing scheduling the hearing held on January 13, 2009. The \ngovernment offered Exhibits (Ex.) 1 through 3, which were admitted into evidence. \nApplicant testified on her own behalf and submitted Exhibits A and B, which were \nadmitted into evidence. The record was kept open for one week to allow  \nApplicant to supplement the record. (Tr. 43) No additional information or documentation \nwas received.

Her proposed budget lists a $25 per \nmonth payment for this debt now handled by a collection agency. (Ex. A) \n \n \nIn 2003, Applicant had a lapse in medical insurance when she was between \nemployers and had some medical problems. (Tr. 34) The medical bills were paid and \nincorporated along with other bills in a bank debt ($17,145) listed in SOR \u00b61.a. She has \nnot heard from this creditor in a long time. The last time they talked, she attempted to \nmake a repayment arrangement but the amount of monthly payment she proposed was \nunacceptable to the creditor.

(Tr. 40) In April 2006, Applicant signed a credit union loan for a pickup truck. \nApplicant was the maker of the loan and not merely a co-signer. (Tr. 46) Another person \nwas supposed to make the monthly payments. The other individual fell behind by \nChristmas 2006. The truck was repossessed in July 2007. (Tr. 45)  \n \n \nApplicant established a signature loan / line of credit that she used for five or six \nyears. She owes $24,000 on this debt (SOR \u00b61.h). Since December 2007, Applicant \nhas been making $125 payment each pay period on the store debt ($4,972) listed in \nSOR \u00b61.d.

(Ex. 3)  \n \n \nIn May 2007, Applicant talked with a bankruptcy attorney, but has not retained \nthe attorney. (Tr. 27, 51) Currently, she does not wish to pursue bankruptcy. In \nNovember 2007, Applicant contacted a debt consolidation company and was told they \ncould not help her with a monthly payment she could afford. The debt consolidation \ncompany suggested Applicant seek bankruptcy protection.  \n \n \nApplicant does not live extravagantly or elaborately. (Tr. 28) Applicant\u2019s yearly \nincome is $54,000. (Tr. 30) Her monthly income after taxes is $2,900. Her disposable \nincome (take home income less monthly expenses) is $332.50 (Ex. A) She has no \ncredit cards. (Tr. 40) Her 2002 Toyota automobile is paid. (Tr. 53) She has not received \nany credit counseling.

In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \n\n \n 5\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nRevised Adjudicative (AG) \u00b6 18 articulates the security concerns relating to \nfinancial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \nAdditionally, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and \nsafeguarding classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect \nof life provides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.  \n \n\n \n 6\nA person\u2019s relationship with her creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \nupon terms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an \napplicant with a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a position of risk \nthat is inconsistent with holding a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be \ndebt free, but is required to manage her finances so as to meet her financial obligations. \n \n \nThe record evidence supports a conclusion Applicant has a history of financial \nproblems. Applicant had ten delinquent accounts which totaled approximately $94,000. \nThroughout this process, she had admitted responsibility for the delinquent debts. She \nis making monthly payment on three of the accounts. Disqualifying Conditions AG \u00b6 \n19(a), \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d and AG \u00b619(c), \u201ca history of not \nmeeting financial obligations,\u201d apply.  \n \n \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) \u2013 (e) are \npotentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 20(a), Applicant=s financial problems were contributed to by a period \nof unemployment. In October 2007, she obtained her current job. The majority of the \ndebts remain unpaid, they are not infrequent, did not happen long ago, and did not \noccur under unusual circumstances. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \n \nAG & 20(b) has some applicability. Under AG & 20(b), Applicant experience a six \nmonth period of unemployment following by a period of underemployment ending in \n\n \n 7\nOctober 2007, when she obtained her current job. Since October 2007, she has made \npayments on three of the SOR debts and is making monthly payments on a forth debt \nnot listed in the SOR. These debts total approximately $6,000. Debts totaling \napproximately $88,000 are not being paid.  \n \n \nApplicant has received no financial counseling. There is no clear indication that \nthe problem is being resolved or is under control. AG & 20(c) does not apply.  \n \n \nApplicant has an agreement paying $125 each pay period on the store debt \n($4,972) listed in SOR \u00b61.d. (Ex. 3), $100 monthly payments on the store debt ($1,097) \nlisted in SOR \u00b61.g., and $25 monthly payments on the overpayment of unemployment \ncompensation debt (balance $120) listed in SOR \u00b61.h. AG & 20(d) applies to these \nthree debts since a good-faith effort is being made to pay these debts.  \n \nAG & 20(e) does not apply because Applicant does not dispute any of the debts.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant incurred approximately \n$54,000 in credit card or line of credit debt. She incurred a $15,000 credit union debt \nwhen she purchased a pickup truck for another. She has learned not to co-sign for \nothers. She owes another credit union approximately $24,000. She has talked with the \ncreditors, but except for the three debts previously listed, Applicant has not paid any of \nher other obligations. She would like to pay all her debts but has only $300 in \ndisposable monthly income.  \n \n\n \n 8\nThis decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot \nor will not attain the state of true reform and rehabilitation necessary to justify the award \nof a security clearance. The awarding of a security clearance is not a once in a life time \noccurrence, but is based on applying the factors, both disqualifying and mitigating, to \nthe evidence presented. Under the Applicant=s current circumstances a clearance is not \nrecommended. If Applicant should be afforded an opportunity to reapply for a security \nclearance in the future, and she has paid or is paying the delinquent obligations, \nestablished compliance with a repayment plan, or otherwise addressed the obligations, \nshe may well demonstrate persuasive evidence of her security worthiness. However, a \nclearance at this time is not warranted.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from her financial \nconsiderations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, financial considerations: \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a \u2013 1.c: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \nFor Applicant  \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e \u2013 1.f: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g \u2013 1.h: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.i \u2013 1. j: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Applicant, her parents, her husband and \nher siblings all have connections to Nigeria. However, none of them currently reside in \nNigeria and none of them intend to permanently reside in Nigeria. She terminated her \naccess to her Nigerian passport. She has significantly greater contacts with the United \nStates than with Nigeria. She can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor \nof U.S. interests. Foreign preference and foreign influence security concerns are \nmitigated. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn August 21, 2006, Applicant submitted a Security Clearance Application (e-\nQIP version) (hereinafter SF 86) (Government Exhibit (GE) 1). On November 28, 2008, \nthe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) to her, alleging security concerns under Guidelines C (Foreign Preference) and B \n(Foreign Influence) (GE 5). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1990), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \n \n1Applicant married on November 21, 2008 (Tr. 36). The statement of reasons reflects her maiden \nname.   \nMarch 24, 2009\n\n \n2 \n                                                                                                                                             \n                                           \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); Department of \nDefense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program, dated Jan. 1987, as \namended (Regulation), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not \nmake the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for her, and \nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance \nshould be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n \nOn December 12, 2008, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge (GE 6). Department Counsel was prepared to \nproceed on February 11, 2009. The case was assigned to me on February 12, 2009. On \nFebruary 18, 2009, DOHA issued a hearing notice. The hearing was held on March 10, \n2009. At the hearing, Department Counsel offered three exhibits (GEs 1-3) (Transcript \n(Tr.) 22-25), and Applicant offered 13 exhibits (Tr. 27-31; AE A-M). There were no \nobjections, and I admitted GEs 1-2 (Tr. 23, 25), and AEs A-M (Tr. 31). Additionally, I \nadmitted the SOR, response to the SOR and the hearing notice (GEs 4-6). I received \nthe transcript on March 19, 2009.  \n \nProcedural Ruling \n \nDepartment Counsel requested administrative notice of facts concerning the \nFederal Republic of Nigeria (hereinafter Nigeria) (Tr. 24-25; GE 3). Department Counsel \nprovided supporting documents to show detail and context for these facts in the \nAdministrative Notice request. Applicant and Department Counsel did not object to me \ntaking administrative notice of all of the facts in all of the documents (Tr. 25-26; GE 3).  \nSee the Nigeria section of the Findings of Fact of this decision, infra, for the material \nfacts from Department Counsel\u2019s submissions on Nigeria. \n \nAdministrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for \nadministrative proceedings. See ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4 n.1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, \n2007); ISCR Case No. 02-24875 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. \n02-18668 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2004) and McLeod v. Immigration and Naturalization  \nService, 802 F.2d 89, 93 n.4 (3d Cir. 1986)). Usually administrative notice at ISCR \nproceedings, is accorded to facts that are either well known or from government reports. \nSee Stein, ADMINISTRATIVE LAW, Section 25.01 (Bender & Co. 2006) (listing fifteen types \nof facts for administrative notice).  \n \nFindings of Fact2 \n \nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations in her response to the SOR (GE 5). Her \nadmissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough \nreview of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact.   \n \n \n2The facts in this decision do not specifically describe employment, names of witnesses or locations \nin order to protect Applicant and her family\u2019s privacy. The cited sources contain more specific information. \n\n \n3 \n                                                                                                                                             \nApplicant was born in the United States (Tr. 15, GE 1). She is 26 years old (Tr. \n5). She left the United States and went to Nigeria when she was three years old. She \nattended most of her grammar and high school in Nigeria. In 1999, she graduated from \na high school in Malaysia (Tr. 5, 18; GE 1). Applicant attended college and university in \nthe United States (Tr. 6). She majored in computer science and received her bachelor\u2019s \ndegree (Tr. 6). In May 2009, she expects to complete her master\u2019s degree in systems \nengineering at a U.S. university (Tr. 20, 38-39). When Applicant held an interim \nclearance she scrupulously protected information and documents (Tr. 21). She does not \ncurrently hold a security clearance (Tr. 6, 21).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s father and mother are citizens of Nigeria (GE 6; SOR \u00b6 2(a)). Her \nparents currently reside in a Western European country (GE 6; SOR \u00b6 2(a)). Her father \nis currently a Nigerian government employee, and he has been a Nigerian government \nemployee for more than 26 years (Tr. 32; GE 6; SOR \u00b6 2(b)). He is in administration and \nmanagement and not involved in setting Nigerian policy (Tr. 33). Her parents own a \nhouse in Nigeria (Tr. 34). They rent their home to tenants (Tr. 34). Her father intends to \nretire from his Nigerian government employment in about a year (Tr. 19). Her parents \nplan to move to the United States (Tr. 20, 34). On February 20, 2008, Applicant filed an \nimmigrant petition on behalf of her parents and they will be applying for permanent U.S. \nresidency (Tr. 20, 34; AE B, C). She frequently communicates with her parents (Tr. 41).    \n \nOn November 21, 2008, Applicant married a native-born, U.S. citizen (Tr. 20, 36). \nHer husband served five years on active duty in the U.S. Marines (Tr. 20, 36). After \nleaving active duty, her husband continued his college education, and moved with \nApplicant to the East Coast (Tr. 20). A defense contractor is now employing him (Tr. 20, \n36-37). He has held a security clearance without a security incident for more than ten \nyears (Tr. 37).   \n \nApplicant and her husband do not own any property or bank accounts in Nigeria \n(Tr. 34, 39). Applicant and her husband have bank accounts in the United States (Tr. \n39). Her husband has weekly conversations with his parents, who live in Nigeria (Tr. \n39). \n \nApplicant\u2019s sister was born in the United States, and her brother was born in \nNigeria (Tr. 15). Applicant lived in the United States for three years before her parents, \nand Applicant returned to Nigeria (Tr. 16). In 1998, Applicant\u2019s father was posted to \nMalaysia and Applicant completed high school in Malaysia (Tr. 17-18). After graduating \nfrom high school in 1999, Applicant and her sister moved in with her uncle and attended \ncollege in the United States (Tr. 18). Applicant attended college and a university for five \nyears (Tr. 18). During her college years, she tutored children in math, English, and \ncollege students in algebra and trigonometry (Tr. 18). She also interned at a \ngovernment agency and a defense contractor (Tr. 18).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s brother is currently attending college in the United States and her \nsister is a PhD candidate at a U.S. university (Tr. 19). Her brother was recently injured \nin Europe, and he has not returned to the United States (Tr. 35). Her sister went to \nEurope to take care of her brother (Tr. 35-36). \n\n \n4 \n                                                                                                                                             \n                                           \nIn December 2008, Applicant went to Nigeria to visit her husband\u2019s parents (Tr. \n37). She stayed at her husband\u2019s parent\u2019s home (Tr. 38). She used her U.S. passport to \nenter Nigeria (Tr. 37). She stayed in Nigeria for three weeks (Tr. 37). Her father-in-law is \na retired university professor and her mother-in-law owns a clothing store (Tr. 42).  \n \nApplicant provided seven character recommendations (AE D-K), and an \nIndividual Excellence Award from her employer (AE L). Most of the letters are from \npeers and supervisors at her employment, and one letter is from her roommate (AE J). \nThe letters laud her dedication, responsibility, trustworthiness, professionalism, \ninitiative, initiative, leadership, reliability, integrity, and active involvement in the \ncommunity.  \n \nForeign preference \n \n \nApplicant obtained a Nigerian passport on March 28, 2000, and subsequently \nrenewed it causing it to remain valid until March 26, 2010 (GE 6; SOR \u00b6 1.a). She used \nher Nigerian passport to travel to Nigeria in December 2003 and December 2005 (GE 6; \nSOR \u00b6 1.b). She lived in Nigeria from 1985 to 1998 she lived in Nigeria about 13 years \n(GE 6; SOR \u00b6 1.c). On February 24, 2009, Applicant and her facility security officer \nsigned a statement indicating she had destroyed or invalidated her Nigerian passport, \nand promised not to possess a foreign passport while holding a security clearance (AE \nA).   \n \nNigeria3 \n \nNigeria is a federal republic that gained independence from Britain in 1960.  \nNigeria is the most populous country in Africa with a population in 2007 of 148 million. \nThe country\u2019s area is about the same as California, Nevada, and Arizona combined. \nThe United States is Nigeria\u2019s largest trading partner. Oil imports from Nigeria to the \nUnited States account for 11% of U.S. oil imports. The United States is the largest \nforeign investor in Nigeria, and U.S. investment is mostly in mining and petroleum.    \n \n\u201cThe [Nigerian] government has lent strong diplomatic support to U.S. \nGovernment counter-terrorism efforts in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, \nterrorist attacks. . . An estimated one million Nigerians and Nigerian Americans live \nstudy and work in the United States, while over 25,000 Americans live and work in \nNigeria.\u201d  \n \nNigeria suffers from political instability, economic crisis, ethnic and religious \nconflict, extreme poverty, lack of law and order, judicial corruption and a history of \nmilitary coups. Nigeria has a poor human rights record. The military has ruled Nigeria \nfor 28 of its 43 years since independence. In May 1999, Nigeria returned to civilian rule. \nNigeria is Africa\u2019s largest oil producer, and conflict results from perceptions of uneven \nand/or unfair distribution of oil revenue.  Lawless elements have engaged in kidnapping \n \n3The facts in the section concerning Nigeria, except for the first two paragraphs, are from \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s factual summary (GE 3). The first two paragraphs are from the U.S. Department of \nState, Bureau of African Affairs, Background Note: Nigeria, Dec. 2008 (Ex. 3, part. I). \n\n \n5 \n                                                                                                                                             \nfor ransom in the Niger Delta area. Heavily armed rival militias engage in conflict. The \nNigerian government has committed human rights violations, and security forces have \ncommitted politically motivated, extrajudicial killings as well as torture and arbitrary \narrest.     \n \nThe Niger Delta states are particularly noted for kidnappings by lawless \nelements. In 2008, the Nigerian Government detained U.S. citizens on six separate \noccasions after travel to the Niger Delta Region. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the Applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the [A]pplicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, \nnothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, \nin whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, \nloyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has not met the strict \nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a \nclearance. \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the Applicant that may disqualify the Applicant from \n\n \n6 \n                                                                                                                                             \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an Applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the Applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An Applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue [his or her] security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly \nabove, I conclude Guidelines C (Foreign Preference) and B (Foreign Influence) are the \nrelevant security concerns with respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR. \n \nForeign Preference \n \nAG \u00b6 9 articulates the Government\u2019s concern about foreign preference, stating, \n\u201cwhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country \nover the United States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or make \ndecisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.\u201d Conditions under AG \u00b6 \n10 that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case include: \n \n(a) exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after \nbecoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family \nmember. This includes but is not limited to: \n \n(1) possession of a current foreign passport; \n \n(2) military service or a willingness to bear arms for a foreign country; \n \n(3) accepting educational, medical, retirement, social welfare, or \nother such benefits from a foreign country; \n \n(4) residence in a foreign country to meet citizenship requirements; \n \n(5) using foreign citizenship to protect financial or business interests \nin another country; \n\n \n7 \n                                                                                                                                             \n \n(6) seeking or holding political office in a foreign country; and  \n \n(7) voting in a foreign election. \n \n(b) action to acquire or obtain recognition of a foreign citizenship by an \nAmerican citizen; \n \n(c) performing or attempting to perform duties, or otherwise acting, so as \nto serve the interests of a foreign person, group, organization, or \ngovernment in conflict with the national security interest; and, \n \n(d) any statement or action that shows allegiance to a country other than \nthe United States: for example, declaration of intent to renounce United \nStates citizenship; renunciation of United States citizenship. \n \n \nApplicant became a U.S. citizen by virtue of her birth in the United States. Her \nparents took her to Nigeria, where she was raised, received educational benefits, and \nexercised other attributes of Nigerian citizenship. She retained a Nigerian passport after \nimmigrating back to the United States in 1999, and used it in 2003 and 2005 to enter \nNigeria. Disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 10(a)(1) and 10a(3) apply. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 11, conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: \n \n(a) dual citizenship is based solely on parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in a \nforeign country; \n \n(b) the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual \ncitizenship; \n \n(c) exercise of the rights, privileges, or obligations of foreign citizenship \noccurred before the individual became a U.S. citizen or when the \nindividual was a minor; \n \n(d) use of a foreign passport is approved by the cognizant security \nauthority; \n \n(e) the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant \nsecurity authority, or otherwise invalidated; and \n \n(f) the vote in a foreign election was encouraged by the United States \nGovernment. \n  \nApplicant\u2019s exercise of the rights, privileges, or obligations of Nigerian citizenship \noccurred when Applicant was a minor, except for her possession and use of her \nNigerian passport in 2003 and 2005 to enter Nigeria. On February 24, 2009, Applicant \nand her facility security officer signed a statement indicating she had destroyed or \n\n \n8 \n                                                                                                                                             \ninvalidated her Nigerian passport, and she promised not to possess a foreign passport \nwhile holding a security clearance. AG \u00b6\u00b6 11(c) and 11(e) apply, and foreign preference \nsecurity concerns are mitigated. \n \nForeign Influence \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 6 explains the security concern about \u201cforeign contacts and interests\u201d \nstating: \n \nif the individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, [he or \nshe] may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, \norganization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is \nvulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication \nunder this Guideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign \ncountry in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, \nincluding, but not limited to, such considerations as whether the foreign \ncountry is known to target United States citizens to obtain protected \ninformation and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nAG \u00b6 7 indicates three conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information; and  \n \n(d) sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \n \nApplicant was born in the United States and moved to Nigeria when she was \nthree years old. Most of the next 13 years were spent in Nigeria. She graduated from a \nMalaysian high school in 1999, and immigrated to the United States. She used a \nNigerian passport to enter Nigeria in 2003 and 2005. Her parents and brother are \ncitizens of Nigeria, and her father is a Nigerian government official. Her husband\u2019s \nparents are residents and citizens of Nigeria. She communicates frequently with her \nparents, and her husband communicates frequently with his parents.  \n \nThe mere possession of close family ties with a person living in a foreign country \nor who is a citizen of a foreign country, is not, as a matter of law, disqualifying under \nGuideline B. However, if only one relative lives in a foreign country, and an Applicant \n\n \n9 \n                                                                                                                                             \n                                           \nhas contacts with that relative, this factor alone is sufficient to create the potential for \nforeign influence and could potentially result in the compromise of classified information. \nSee ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 \n(App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001).  \n \nThe nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and \nits human rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an Applicant\u2019s family \nmembers are vulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or \nduress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a \nfamily member is associated with or dependent upon the government, or the country is \nknown to conduct intelligence collection operations against the United States. The \nrelationship of Nigeria with the United States, places a significant, but not \ninsurmountable burden of persuasion on Applicant to demonstrate that her and her \nhusband\u2019s relationship with family members who are citizens of Nigeria or living in \nNigeria do not pose a security risk. Applicant\u2019s father is a Nigerian government official \nand as such he is dependent upon the Nigerian government for his salary and possible \nretirement benefits. Applicant should not be placed into a position where she might be \nforced to choose between loyalty to the United States and a desire to protect her family \nmembers or her husband\u2019s family living in a foreign country from harm, pressure or \ncoercion.4 With its negative human rights record, and high levels of crime in Nigeria  as \nwell as other political, economic and military problems in this country, it is conceivable \nthat anyone living in Nigeria might be targeted by governmental or non-governmental \ncriminal elements in an attempt to gather information from the United States. \n \nWhile there is no evidence that intelligence operatives from Nigeria seek \nclassified or economic information from United States\u2019 businesses, Applicant\u2019s \nconnections to her family living in Nigeria (including her in-laws) create a potential \nconflict of interest because her relationship is sufficiently close to raise a security \nconcern about her desire to assist relatives living in Nigeria or with Nigerian citizenship \nby providing sensitive or classified information.    \n \nDepartment Counsel produced substantial evidence of Applicant\u2019s contacts with \nher relatives who are citizens of Nigeria or live in Nigeria to raise the issue of potential \nforeign pressure or attempted exploitation. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(b), and 7(d) apply and further \ninquiry is necessary about potential application of any mitigating conditions.  \n \nAG \u00b6 8 lists six conditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns \nincluding: \n \n \n4 An applicant with relatives in Iran, for example, has a much heavier burden to overcome than an \napplicant with relatives living in Nigeria. See ISCR Case No. 02-13595 at 3 (App. Bd. May 10, 2005) \n(stating an applicant has \u201ca very heavy burden of persuasion to overcome the security concerns\u201d when \nparents and siblings live in Iran). See also ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 4 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) \n(articulating \u201cvery heavy burden\u201d standard when an applicant has family members living in Iran); ISCR \nCase No. 07-12471 at 9 (A.J. May 30, 2008) (listing numerous recent cases involving U.S. citizens with \nIranian connections whose clearances were denied, and citing no recent cases where the Appeal Board \naffirmed the grant of a clearance for someone with immediate family members living in Iran). \n \n\n \n10 \n                                                                                                                                             \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country \nis so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected \nto resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest;  \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; \n \n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or \nare approved by the cognizant security authority; \n \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency \nrequirements regarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from \npersons, groups, or organizations from a foreign country; and \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n  \n \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) partially applies; however, 8(c), 8(d), and 8(e) do not apply because \nthe U.S. government has not encouraged her involvement with Nigerian citizens, her \ntravel to Nigeria, or other Nigerian connections. Applicant has frequent contact with her \nparents, and her spouse has frequent contact with his parents, who are living in Nigeria. \nAdditionally, Applicant has gone to Nigeria in 2003, 2005, and for three weeks in 2008. \nHer contacts with family members (including her in-laws) are sufficiently frequent to \nraise the possibility of her being forced to choose between the United States and the \nwelfare of her relatives, who are citizens of Nigeria and/or living in Nigeria. She is not \nable to fully meet her burden of showing there is \u201clittle likelihood that [her relationships \nwith her relatives who are Nigerian citizens] could create a risk for foreign influence or \nexploitation.\u201d   \n \nAG \u00b6 8(b) fully applies. There is no evidence that her relatives, who are Nigerian \ncitizens and/or living in Nigeria are or have been political activist(s), challenging the \npolicies of the Nigerian governments. Her father is an official in the Nigerian government \nand has held a Nigerian government position for almost thirty years. There is no \nevidence that terrorists, criminals, the Nigerian government or her father have \napproached or threatened Applicant or her Nigerian relatives for classified or sensitive \ninformation. As such, there is a reduced possibility that her Nigerian relatives or \n\n \n11 \n                                                                                                                                             \nApplicant herself would be targets for coercion or exploitation. While the government \ndoes not have any burden to prove the presence of such evidence, if such record \nevidence was present, Applicant would have a very heavy evidentiary burden to \novercome to mitigate foreign influence security concerns.   \n \nA key factor in the AG \u00b6 8(b) analysis is Applicant\u2019s \u201cdeep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S.\u201d She must establish that \u201c[she] can be expected to \nresolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d Applicant is a native-born, \nU.S. citizen. She received her post-secondary education in the United States. Her \nhusband is a U.S. citizen, veteran of five years active duty service in the U.S. Marines, \nand 10-year security clearance holder. Applicant and her husband reside in the United \nStates. Her siblings are U.S. residents. Her sister is a native-born U.S. citizen. Her \nparents intend to become permanent residents of the United States. She has a bank \naccount in the United States, and does not own property or have a bank account in \nNigeria. Her primary connections to Nigeria are her in-laws who live in Nigeria and her \nparents, who are Nigerian citizens living in Europe, as part of her father\u2019s Nigerian \ngovernment employment.  \n  \nAG \u00b6 8(f) partially applies because Applicant has no interest in property or bank \naccounts in Nigeria. This mitigating condition can only mitigate AG \u00b6 7(e), which \nprovides, \u201ca substantial business, financial, or property interest in a foreign country, or in \nany foreign-owned or foreign-operated business, which could subject the individual to \nheightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation.\u201d  \n \nIn sum, Applicant\u2019s connections to Nigeria are much less significant than her \nconnections to Nigeria. Her connections to the United States taken together are \nsufficient to fully overcome the foreign influence security concerns.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. I have incorporated my comments \n\n \n12 \n                                                                                                                                             \n                                           \nunder Guidelines C and B in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) \nwere addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nA Guideline B and C decision concerning Nigeria must take into consideration \nthe geopolitical situation in Nigeria, as well as the dangers existing in Nigeria.5 While \nthere is no evidence Nigeria is a known collector of U.S. intelligence and sensitive \neconomic information, Nigeria has very serious economic, military, political, judicial/legal \nand social problems. Nigeria and the United States are closely related. Nigeria is the \nmost populous country in Africa and about one million Nigerians live in the United \nStates. The United States is Nigeria\u2019s largest trading partner.     \n \nApplicant traveled to Nigeria in 2003 and 2005 using a Nigerian passport, and in \n2008 she went to Nigeria and stayed for three weeks with her in-laws, who are citizens \nand residents of Nigeria. She frequently communicates with her Nigerian parents, who \nare currently living in Europe. Her father is an official in the Nigerian government. Her \nties to her father, mother, siblings, and in-laws are limited to telephone calls and visits. \nHer communications establish ties of affection to her Nigerian family members. Her \nhusband frequently communicates to his parents who are Nigerian citizens and reside in \nNigeria. There is some possibility that Applicant or her husband could be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, group, \norganization, or government and the interests of the United States, especially because \nNigeria has a significant lawless element, who may attempt to harm or pressure \nApplicant\u2019s relatives to gain some kind of advantage over Applicant.  \n \nThe circumstances militating towards approval of a clearance are more \nsignificant. Applicant was born in the United States. She left Nigeria in 1999, just after \ngraduating from a Malaysian high school. She has earned a bachelor\u2019s degree at a U.S. \nuniversity and is close to completing a master\u2019s degree at a U.S. university. In February \n2008, she filed documentation so that her parents can become U.S. permanent \nresidents. Her father plans to retire from Nigerian government service in about a year, \nand then her parents will be able to permanently move to the United States. Most \nimportantly, her husband is a U.S. citizen and five-year active-duty veteran of the U.S. \nMarines. He has been a security clearance holder for ten years and the U.S. \ngovernment trusts him with classified information. Her sister is a U.S. citizen, and both \nof her siblings are U.S. residents, who are attending post-secondary schools in the \nUnited States. She and her facility security officer documented the termination of her \naccess to her Nigerian passport. Applicant provided seven character recommendations \nand an Individual Excellence Award from her employer. Her character references and \nwork performance award evidence her dedication, responsibility, trustworthiness, \nprofessionalism, reliability, integrity, and active involvement in her community. Although \nthe possibility of attempted exploitation of Applicant is relatively low, Applicant\u2019s strong \nconnections to the United States and especially to her U.S. family, community and \nemployment establish \u201csuch deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the \n \n5 See ISCR Case No. 04-02630 at 3 (App. Bd. May 23, 2007) (remanding because of insufficient \ndiscussion of geopolitical situation and suggesting expansion of whole person discussion). \n  \n\n \n13 \n                                                                                                                                             \n                                           \nU.S., [she] can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. \ninterest.\u201d   \n \nAfter weighing the evidence of her connections to Nigeria and to the United \nStates, and all the facts in this decision, I conclude Applicant has carried her burden of \nmitigating the foreign preference and foreign influence security concerns. \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d6 and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, all the evidence in this decision, and my interpretation of my responsibilities \nunder the Guidelines. For the reasons stated, I conclude she is eligible for access to \nclassified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline C:    \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.c: \n For Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline B:    \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a to 2.c: \n For Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nMark W. Harvey \nAdministrative Judge \n \n6See ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd.

On October 24, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security \nconcerns under Guideline G, Alcohol Consumption, Guideline H, Drug Involvement, and \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct, for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive \nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), \nas amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn November 4, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a \ndetermination be made in his case without a hearing.  On December 29, 2008, \nDepartment Counsel prepared a File Of Relevant Material (FORM). The FORM was \nmailed to Applicant on that same date. Applicant received the FORM on January 5, \n2009. He had thirty days from the receipt of the FORM to submit additional matters. He \ntimely submitted additional matters. On January 15, 2009, Department Counsel \nFebruary 13, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \nindicated that they had no objection to the additional matters. The case was assigned to \nme on January 21, 2009.

This is his first time applying for a security \nclearance. He is single and has no children. (Item 3)   \n \nApplicant started drinking alcohol when he was 16-years-old. The extent of \nApplicant\u2019s alcohol use was a few beers or a mixed drink. He drank alcohol at parties \nwhich occurred approximately every two weeks. He rarely drinks to intoxication. He still \ndrinks alcohol occasionally at certain social events. (Item 4 at 8) \n \nOn September 10, 2005, Applicant was arrested and charged with Driving While \nIntoxicated. He was visiting his girlfriend who was a college student. He was driving her \nback to her dormitory after attending a party. He had drank a few alcoholic drinks.

(Item 3, question 23; Item 4 at 7; Item \n5) \n  \nIn October 2005, Applicant received a citation for underage possession of \nalcohol. He was at a party at a friend\u2019s house. The neighbors called the police due to \nthe noise. Applicant subsequently appeared in court, and was ordered to pay a fine and \ncourt costs. (Item 3, question 23; Item 4 at 3-4)  \n \n On October 8, 2005, Applicant was caught shoplifting a $50 pair of earrings from \na department store. He was charged with petit larceny and given a citation. He pled \nguilty and was ordered to pay a fine, court costs, and rehabilitation classes. (Item 3, \nquestion 23; Item 4 at 5-6; Item 6)  \n \nApplicant started to use marijuana in June 2004, at age 18. From June 2004 to \nJune 2007, he used marijuana on at least ten occasions.  He used marijuana with \nfriends and at parties. Applicant sold marijuana during the time period that he used \nmarijuana (June 2004 to June 2007). He purchased the marijuana from mutual friends \nor acquaintances and resold the marijuana to other acquaintances. He would not \nprovide the names of the people from whom he purchased or to whom he sold \n\n \n3 \n \n \nmarijuana. The extent of Applicant\u2019s involvement in the purchasing and selling of \nmarijuana is unknown. He claims his marijuana use had no impact on his work, school \nwork, or family life. He stopped using marijuana in June 2007 because he \u201cgrew up.\u201d \n(Item 3, question 24; Item 4 at 9)  \n \nIn July 2003, Applicant used cocaine on three occasions. He used cocaine with \nsome of his high school friends at a party. He snorted a line of cocaine on each \noccasion that he used cocaine. (Item 3, question 24; Item 4 at 10) \n \nIn June 2003, Applicant used psilocybin, otherwise known as hallucinogenic \nmushrooms, on approximately three occasions. The first time he used was with some \nfriends while attending a rock concert.  He used hallucinogenic mushrooms once when \nhe was alone. (Item 3, question 24; Item 4 at 10-11)  \n \nMarijuana, cocaine, and psilocybin are considered illegal drugs in the United \nStates. (Item 10; Item 11; Item 12)  \n \nApplicant does not think his illegal drug use or his alcohol use have caused him \nany problems. His mother is aware of the full extent of his drug and alcohol use. He \ndoes not intend to use illegal drugs again. (Item 4; Applicant\u2019s Response to FORM, \nundated, received by DOHA, January 15, 2009)  \n   \nIn his response to the FORM, Applicant states September 2005 through \nDecember 2005 was a difficult time for him. He learned to be an adult during that \nperiod. He learned that it is not worth risking his future to drink and drive or to shoplift. \nHe no longer drinks and drives. He understands it is a responsibility to drink. The \nshoplifting offense was a one-time incident and he knows that he made a mistake. He \nknew when he used marijuana, cocaine and psilocybin that they were illegal and \ndangerous. He claims that his use was experimental and he did not abuse drugs. He \ndoes not intend to use illegal drugs again. He has an amazing opportunity in his current \njob. He understands that obtaining and maintaining a security clearance will mean more \nresponsibility. He believes he is ready for the opportunity. While his past mistakes do \nnot make him a perfect candidate for a security clearance, he believes he has grown \nfrom his mistakes. (Applicant\u2019s Response to FORM) \n \nApplicant was a teller at a local bank. The senior vice president of the bank has \nworked with Applicant over the past three years. She describes him as \u201ca very fine \nyoung man of the utmost honesty and compassion.\u201d She states he has contributed a lot \nto making the bank a success.  The assistant branch manager of the bank has worked \nwith Applicant since April 2004. She states that Applicant was promoted to information \ntechnology assistant with the company because of his superior performance. The vice \npresident of information technology has worked with Applicant in various capacities over \nthe past three years. Applicant has worked directly for him for the past two years. \nApplicant demonstrates an eagerness and ability to learn new things. He shows a \nmaturity and focus well beyond others in his age group. He highly recommends \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant for any position or endeavor he may seek to pursue. (Applicant\u2019s Response to \nFORM, attached reference letters) \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother manages a gas station. Applicant worked for her at the gas \nstation from June 1997 to August 2004. She states that Applicant works well with \nothers. He was a natural at customer service and problem solving. He has excellent \ncharacter and the natural ability to learn and adapt to changing environments. \n(Applicant\u2019s Response to FORM, attached reference letters) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \n\n \n5 \n \n \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Alcohol Consumption is set out \nin AG &21:       \n \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.  \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. I find the following Alcohol Consumption Disqualifying Conditions (AC DC) \napply: \n \nAC DC &22(a) (alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while \nunder the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol \nabuser or alcohol dependent) applies because Applicant was charged with alcohol-\nrelated offenses on two separate occasions. He was arrested for DWI on September 10, \n2005. He was cited for underage possession of alcohol in October 2005.  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from alcohol consumption. \n \nAlcohol Consumption Mitigating Condition (AC MC) \u00b623(a) (so much time has \npassed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it happened under such unusual \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) applies. More than three years \nhave passed since Applicant was charged with the alcohol offenses. He has completed \nall of his court-ordered duties. His current level of alcohol use does not raise issues \npertaining to his judgment, reliability and trustworthiness. He is of legal age to drink \nalcohol and understands the gravity involved with drinking and driving.   \n \nApplicant\u2019s current level of alcohol use no longer raises a security concern. \nGuideline G is found for Applicant. \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement is set out in \nAG &24:       \n \nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may \nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.  \n \nDrugs are defined as mood and behavior altering substances, and include: (1) \nDrugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and listed in the Controlled \nSubstances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., marijuana or cannabis, depressants, \nnarcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens), and (2) inhalants and other similar \nsubstances. AG \u00b624(a). \n \nDrug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner that \ndeviates from approved medical direction. AG \u00b624(b). \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. I find Drug Involvement Disqualifying Condition (DI DC) &25(a) (any drug \nabuse) and DI DC \u00b625(c) (illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, \nmanufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia) apply \nto Applicant\u2019s case. Applicant admits to illegally using marijuana on at least ten \noccasions between June 2004 and June 2007. He illegally used cocaine and psilocybin \non several occasions in the summer of 2003. He admits to purchasing and selling \nmarijuana to other individuals over a three year period. \n \nSince Applicant admitted the SOR allegations and the government produced \nsubstantial evidence by way of exhibits to raise disqualifying conditions, the burden \nshifted to Applicant to produce evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nsecurity concerns (Directive \u00b6E3.1.15). An applicant has the burden of proving a \nmitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the government. \n(See, ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (DOHA Appeal Board Decision, September 22, \n2005)  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from drug involvement. The following have the potential to apply to \nApplciant\u2019s case: \n \nDrug Involvement Mitigating Condition (DI MC) \u00b626(a) (the behavior happened so \nlong ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to \nrecur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment) \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nDI MC &26(b) (a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such \nas: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or avoiding \nthe environment where drugs were used; (3) an appropriate period of abstinence; and \n(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for any violation.)  \n \nWhile Applicant states that he has matured and no longer uses illegal drugs, his \nlast use occurred less than two years ago, just six months prior to the submission of his  \napplication for a security clearance. Applicant\u2019s illegal drug use occurred over a period \nof several years. He used three different illegal drugs (i.e. marijuana, cocaine, and \npsilocybin) on numerous occasions.  His drug use cannot be considered experimental. \nWhile it has been several years since he last used cocaine and psilocybin, he last used \nmarijuana in June 2007.  His marijuana involvement is further aggravated by the fact he \npurchased and sold marijuana to other individuals. The record is unclear as to the \nextent that Applicant purchased and sold marijuana. The record is unclear as to whether \nApplicant still socializes with the acquaintances with whom he purchased, sold and \nused illegal drugs.   \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions under drug involvement apply. Applicant has \nthe burden to mitigate the concerns raised under drug involvement. He has not met his \nburden to mitigate the security concerns raised under drug involvement because \nApplicant\u2019s use of illegal drugs occurred on numerous occasions over a five year period. \nHe not only used illegal drugs but also purchased and sold marijuana. Considering the \nextent of his illegal drug use and that his last use of illegal drugs occurred less than two \nyears ago, there is insufficient evidence in the record to mitigate the concerns raised \nunder drug involvement. Guideline H is found against Applicant.  \n \nCriminal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern raised under the criminal conduct guideline is set forth in \n\u00b630 of the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines: \n \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \n \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability \n \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \nThere are two Criminal Conduct Disqualifying Conditions (CC DC) which apply to \nApplicant\u2019s case. CC DC \u00b631(a) (a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses) and \nCC DC \u00b631(c) (allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the \nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted) apply with respect to \nApplicant\u2019s three arrests in 2005 for Driving While Intoxicated, Underage Possession of \nAlcohol, and Petit Larceny.  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nThe following Criminal Conduct Mitigating Conditions (CC MC) potentially apply \nto Applicant\u2019s case: \n \nCC MC \u00b632(a) (so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, \nor it happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment)  \n \nCC MC \u00b632(d) (there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not \nlimited to the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or constructive \ncommunity involvement) \n \nWhile Applicant has not been arrested since 2005 and has completed the terms \nof his court-ordered sentences, his criminal behavior continued until June 2007. By his \nown admission, Applicant purchased, used and sold marijuana up until that time. The \npurchase, sale and use of marijuana is illegal. The criminal conduct is not diminished  \nbecause Applicant was never arrested. While Department Counsel did not cross allege \nthis conduct under criminal conduct, it is conduct that can be evaluated when \nconsidering mitigation of the criminal conduct concern.  \n \nMore than three years have passed since Applicant\u2019s last criminal charge \noccurred. However, Applicant stopped using, purchasing and selling illegal drugs less \nthan two years ago. Not enough information was provided about the extent of \nApplicant\u2019s involvement with the illegal purchase and sale of marijuana to conclude this \nis no longer an issue. While several of these offenses were minor, Applicant committed \nnumerous criminal offenses over a five-year period. There is not enough information in \nthe record to conclude Applicant mitigated the criminal conduct concern. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant did not provide information \n\n \n9 \n \n \npertaining to his work performance in his current job, but I considered the favorable \nstatements from his co-workers at his former places of employment. Applicant\u2019s recent \nalcohol use no longer raises a concern under alcohol involvement. The alcohol \nconsumption concerns are mitigated. However, Applicant did not mitigate the security \nconcerns raised under drug involvement and criminal conduct.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline H:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.d:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline J:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n                                           \n \n \n \n_________________ \nERIN C. HOGAN \nAdministrative Judge \n",

On May 26, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\n\n2\nrequested a decision on the written record.  On January 12, 2010, after considering the record,\nAdministrative Judge Marc E. Curry denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant\nappealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether certain of the Judge\u2019s factual\nfindings are based upon substantial record evidence; whether Applicant was denied due process; and\nwhether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Finding no error,\nwe affirm.  \nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant was born and raised in\na Middle-Eastern country.  He immigrated to the U.S. in the 1970s and became a U.S. citizen in the\nearly 1980s.  He has worked as a translator in support of U.S. military operations.\nIn the late 1980s Applicant was a successful real estate developer.  He was a partner in a\ncompany that owned several shopping centers.  In the early 1990s the real estate market crashed, and\nApplicant became unable to pay his creditors.  His debts were discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy\nin the mid-1990s.\nAfter his discharge in bankruptcy, Applicant became a stockbroker.  This endeavor faltered\nduring the stock market crash that followed the attacks of September 11, 2001.  Some of his clients\nsued him.  Additionally, he experienced family difficulties which added to his money problems.  The\nIRS filed a lien against Applicant\u2019s property for unpaid taxes.  In 2006 he filed again for Chapter 7\nbankruptcy protection, listing liabilities of $482,000 (including $140,000 in back federal and state\ntaxes).  His debts were discharged in bankruptcy later that year.  Part of the bankruptcy process\nincluded Applicant\u2019s completion of budget and credit counseling. \nIn late 2006, the state obtained a lien against Applicant\u2019s property for unpaid taxes.  In early\n2007, the IRS obtained a lien due to unpaid federal taxes.  He has entered into agreements to repay\nthese debts on a monthly basis.  \nIn deciding the case adversely to Applicant, the Judge considered Applicant\u2019s contributions\nto U.S. security, and he acknowledged that Applicant\u2019s financial problems were affected by\ncircumstances outside his control.  However, he also noted the recurrent nature of Applicant\u2019s\nfinancial problems, the relatively large amount of debt Applicant had amassed prior to the 2006\nbankruptcy, and the amount of delinquent debts remaining.  He stated that not all of Applicant\u2019s\nfinancial problems corresponded with downturns in the economy.  He also concluded that Applicant\nhad not corroborated his claims to have been making payments consistent with the repayment plans.\nApplicant contends that he was denied due process, in that he did not present cancelled\nchecks to demonstrate payment.  He asserts that he was advised that all he needed to present was\nevidence of a payment plan rather than of actual payment.  He attaches to his appeal copies of\ncancelled checks.  This is new evidence, which the Board cannot consider.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.\n(\u201cNo new evidence shall be received or considered by the Appeal Board\u201d).  See also ISCR Case No.\n08-06875 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 29, 2009); ISCR Case No. 08-06518 at 2 (App. Bd. Mar. 3, 2009).\n\nApplicant\u2019s brief states that he acted pro se in preparing the response.  However, the cover letter accompanying\n1\nApplicant\u2019s response to the FORM names an attorney as the one who is to receive the decision in Applicant\u2019s case and\nto whom questions should be addressed.  Therefore, at the very least, Applicant was aware of his right to consult counsel.\n3\nApplicant does not state who advised him concerning the extent of the evidence that he needed to\nsubmit in response to the FORM.  In any event, he appears to have had the opportunity to seek\nassistance of counsel in preparing his response,  and the record as a whole provides no reason to\n1\nbelieve that Applicant was denied the due process afforded by the Directive.  See ISCR Case No. 09-\n01074 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2009); ISCR Case No. 08-03110 at 2 (App. Bd. Jan. 27, 2009).\nFurthermore, the payment plan was new at the close of the record.  There is no basis to conclude that\nApplicant could have documented a substantial number of payments.   \nApplicant contends that the Judge erred in his finding as to the amount Applicant owes to\nthe IRS.  We conclude that the Judge\u2019s material findings of security concern are based upon\nsubstantial record evidence.  See  Directive  \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  (Substantial evidence is \u201csuch relevant\nevidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the\ncontrary evidence in the same record.\u201d) The record demonstrates that, as the Judge found, there is\nsubstantial evidence in support of the SOR allegations.  \nAfter reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant data\nand articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

DeLaney, Esquire\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nCURRY, Marc E., Administrative Judge:\nOver the past twenty years, Applicant has filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy\nprotection twice, and is currently behind on his federal and state income taxes. Although\nhe recently established a payment plan, it is too soon to conclude that he has mitigated\nthe Financial Considerations security concern. Clearance is denied.\nOn May 26, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its denial of Applicant\u2019s security\nclearance. Specifically, it alleged facts which raise concerns under Guidelines F,\nFinancial Considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nJanuary 12, 2010\n\n2\nApplicant answered the SOR on June 15, 2009, and requested an administrative\ndetermination. On August 14, 2009, the government prepared a File of Relevant\nMaterials (FORM). Applicant received the FORM on September 28, 2009, and prepared\na response that day. The government received Applicant\u2019s response on October 1,\n2009, and the case was assigned to me on October 8, 2009.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 56-year-old married man with three adult children. He was born\nand raised in Iraq, immigrated to the United States (U.S.) in the 1970s, and became a\nnaturalized U.S. citizen in 1982 (Item 8 at 10). Since 2006, he has worked for various\ndefense contractors as a translator and bi-cultural advisor in support of Operation Iraqi\nFreedom (Id.). \nIn the late 1980s, Applicant was a successful real estate investor (FORM\nResponse, Exhibit C at 9). By 1991, he was a partner in a company that owned 14\nshopping centers (Id.). He financed the purchase of these shopping centers through\nloans that he had personally guaranteed (Id.). In 1992, the commercial real estate\nmarket \u201cfell apart\u201d (Id.; FORM Response, Exhibit A at 1). As vacancies mounted,\nApplicant became unable to pay his creditors (Id.). \nIn 1994, Applicant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy.

By the end of the decade, he\nwas earning, on average, approximately $150,000 per year (FORM, Exhibit C at 6).\nShortly after 9/11, however, \u201cthe stock market tanked\u201d and Applicant\u2019s income\ndecreased (Item 16 at 27). Also, the investments that he was managing for his clients\nbegan to fail. (Id.). Subsequently, some of his clients became disgruntled and sued him\n(Id.). \nAt or about the time Applicant began having financial difficulties, his mother and\nbrother died (Id.). Applicant was solely responsible for their funeral arrangements. Also,\nhe had to support his brother\u2019s children (Id.).\nApplicant\u2019s debts, including his federal and state income tax payments, gradually\nbecame delinquent. In March 2004, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) filed a lien\nagainst his property for approximately $60,000 in unpaid taxes (Item 15). In 2005, two of\nApplicant\u2019s cars were repossessed, and his mortgage was foreclosed (Item 16 at 17-18,\n29). In July 2006, Applicant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection (Item 9 at 4). He\nlisted on the petition $482,000 in liabilities, including $140,000 of delinquent state and\nfederal income taxes spanning tax years 1998 to 2005 (Item 16 at 15). As part of the\nbankruptcy process, Applicant completed a budget and credit counseling course (Item\n\n3\n16 at 2). Later in 2006, all of Applicant\u2019s debts, except approximately $66,000 of back\nfederal and state income taxes, were discharged (Item 16 at 42). \nIn December 2006, the state revenue taxing authority entered a lien against\nApplicant\u2019s property in the amount of approximately $8,700 for back income taxes (Item\n8 at 40). In November 2007, Applicant entered into a payment plan to resolve his back\nstate income taxes (FORM Response, Exhibit C at 1). Under the plan, he is to pay $100\nmonthly (Id.). Applicant provided no evidence supporting his contention that he has\nbeen complying with the plan.\nIn January 2007, the IRS obtained a lien against Applicant\u2019s property for\napproximately $41,000 (Item 14 at 1). In May 2009, Applicant entered into a payment\nplan with the IRS (FORM Response, Exhibit C at 3). As of September 2009, he owed\nthe federal government approximately $76,000 of back income taxes for tax years 2002\nthrough 2005 (FORM Response, Exhibit B). Under the plan, he is to pay $1,000\nmonthly. He provided no evidence of payments. \nApplicant maintains a budget. As of September 2008, he earns approximately\n$8,900 monthly and has $34,000 in savings (Item 9 at 3).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied together with the factors\nlisted in the adjudicative process. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a\nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The\nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person,\npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\n\n4\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours. The government reposes a high degree of trust and\nconfidence in individuals to whom it grants access to classified information. Decisions\ninclude, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a\ncertain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk\nof compromise of classified information.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nUnder this guideline, \u201cfailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information\u201d (AG\n\u00b6 18). Moreover, \u201can individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to\nengage in illegal acts to generate funds\u201d (Id.). Applicant\u2019s history of financial\ndelinquencies triggers the application of AG && 19(a), \u201can inability or unwillingness to\nsatisfy debts,@ and 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \nAt different periods during Applicant\u2019s career, his financial well-being was\ndependent on the viability of both the commercial real estate market and the stock\nmarket. Consequently, his contention that his financial hardship corresponded with\ndownturns in these respective markets was credible. Applicant, however, provided\nneither specific evidence detailing the relationship of these market factors to his\nfinancial difficulties, nor specific evidence detailing any steps he took to stabilize his\nfinances before filing for bankruptcy protection. Also, he offered no explanation as to\nwhy his delinquencies, which were most recently discharged, were so extensive.\nMoreover, not all of Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties corresponded with downturns in the\nU.S. economy. For example, Applicant attributes the cause of his most recent financial\nstruggles to the post-9/11 stock market downturn; however, the evidence indicates that\nsome of his delinquencies predate 9/11 by three years.\nIn 2006, Applicant obtained a discharge of all of his delinquent commercial debts\nand a partial discharge of his back state and federal income taxes. He is paying the\nremaining tax debt through installment agreements. However, Applicant still owes\n\n5\napproximately $85,000 of delinquent federal and state income tax debt, and just began\npaying the federal tax debt in September 2009. Although he arranged the state tax\npayment plan two years ago, he provided no evidence that he has been complying with\nthe plan. \nThe cause of Applicant\u2019s delinquencies and the steps he has taken to address\nthem, including counseling, are sufficient to merit application of AG \u00b6 20(a), \u201cthe\nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s\ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical\nemergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), and the individual acted responsibly\nunder the circumstances,\u201d AG \u00b6 20(d), \u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to\nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts,\u201d and the first prong of AG \u00b6 20(c),\n\u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem . . . .\u201d However, the\namount of his outstanding delinquent debt and his failure to provide evidence\ndemonstrating compliance with the income tax installment payment agreements compel\nme to conclude that the second prong of AG \u00b6 20(c), \u201c. . . there are clear indications that\nthe problem is being resolved or is under control,\u201d does not apply.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.\nApplicant deserves credit for assisting the U.S. war effort by returning to his\nnative country to work as a translator and bi-cultural advisor. Circumstances beyond his\ncontrol contributed to his financial difficulties. Absent more detail about these\ncircumstances, this mitigating factor is outweighed by the recurrent nature of his\nfinancial difficulties, the amount of debt Applicant accrued before filing for bankruptcy\nprotection in 2006, the amount of delinquent debt that remains outstanding, and the lack\nof documentation supporting Applicant\u2019s contention that he has been satisfying the\nremaining income tax delinquencies. Upon evaluating the whole person factors, I\n\n6\nconclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\naccess to classified information. Clearance is denied.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                             \nMARC E. CURRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Murphy, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nHOWE, Philip S., Administrative Judge: \n \nOn October 10, 2007, Applicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF \n86). On February 20, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F \n(Financial Considerations). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on March 10, 2009, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed \non June 2, 2009, and I received the case assignment on June 5, 2009. DOHA issued a \nNotice of Hearing on July 9, 2009, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on July 30, \n2009. The Government offered Exhibits 1 through 8, which were received without \nobjection, except for Exhibits 5 to 8. Applicant objected to their admission, and I denied \n \n1 \n \n \nOctober 29, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \nhis objections, admitting these documents into evidence. Applicant testified and \nsubmitted Exhibits A through E, without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the \nhearing (Tr.) on August 7, 2009. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, \nexhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. He \ndenied the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c of the SOR. He also provided additional \ninformation to support his request for eligibility for a security clearance.   \n \nApplicant is 63 years old and married to his present wife for 20 years.  He has \ntwo adult children from his first marriage, which ended in divorce in 1989.  He has a \nmaster\u2019s degree in industrial engineering administration.  He works for a defense \ncontractor. (Tr. 23, 25, 26, 41, 50; Exhibit 1) \n \nApplicant separated from his first wife in 1985. He received custody of their two \nchildren, who were nine and six years old at the time. He was divorced in 1989. \nApplicant worked on a contractual basis for various companies during the 1980s, and \nwas responsible for paying his own federal withholding taxes. In the tax years 1988 and \n1989 he failed to have sufficient withholding taxes taken. Applicant also claimed his \nincome in that time period was spent on child care for his minor children and living \nexpenses, so he did not have sufficient money to pay his federal taxes. The Internal \nRevenue Service (IRS) filed tax liens in 1995 for $260 and in 1997 for $68,754.49 \nagainst Applicant. He did nothing for several years to resolve these liens, complaining \nthat the IRS would not speak with him about the liens.  Finally, he found a tax relief \nservice over the internet and paid them $5,400 to resolve his tax liens. He contracted \nwith this service in 2004. They stopped the IRS from continuing to take his tax refunds \neach year. This tax service did nothing beyond that work for their fee. Applicant has \nreceived his tax refunds since 2005. While the tax refunds were taken, Applicant \nestimates that he paid the IRS about $20,000 through that process. (Tr. 28-36, 43; \nExhibits 2-8) \n \nApplicant retained an attorney in 2009 and obtained the IRS tax lien releases.  \nHe filed them with the appropriate county official in June 2009. Both liens were released \nby the IRS. These tax debts are resolved. (Tr. 37; Exhibits A to E) \n \nAs a result of his separation from his first wife and her failure to pay debts for \nwhich he gave her money, Applicant filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy in December 1985.  \nHe was discharged in bankruptcy in November 1986. Since then, his credit reports \nshow Applicant has regularly paid his financial obligations. (Tr. 46; Exhibits 5, 6, C-E) \n \nApplicant had a security clearance when he served in the military services from \n1967 to 1971.  Applicant did not report any security violations during that time period. \n(Tr. 24; Exhibit 1)   \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration \nof the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nAG \u00b6 19 describes nine conditions that could raise a security concern and may \nbe disqualifying.  Of these nine conditions, three potentially apply to the facts in this \ncase:   \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(d) deceptive or illegal financial practices such as embezzlement, \nemployee theft, check fraud, income tax evasion, expense account fraud, \nfiling deceptive loan statements, and other intentional financial breaches \nof trust. \n \nApplicant accumulated significant tax liabilities for 1988 and 1989 because he did \nnot have sufficient money withheld from his contractual employment payments. The IRS \nfiled tax liens to enforce payment of the tax liabilities. Applicant did nothing to resolve \nthese tax liabilities until 2004 when he hired a tax resolution company he found on the \ninternet. AG & 19(a) and AG \u00b6 (c) apply.  \n \nApplicant evaded paying the correct amount of income tax from his contractual \nincome in 1988 and 1989 because he thought he needed the money to pay for child \ncare for his children. By doing so, he committed income tax evasion. AG \u00b6 19 (d) \napplies. The evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions,. \n \nThe guideline AG \u00b6 20 provides six conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. Three conditions may apply:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nand \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nThe Applicant=s income tax problems and Chapter 7 bankruptcy arose in 1985 \nwhen he separated and subsequently divorced his first wife. He obtained custody of his \ntwo minor children, necessitating child care expenses until he remarried in 1990. These \ncircumstances are no longer extant, being one-time occurrences in Applicant\u2019s life. \nSince then, he has regularly paid his debts and taxes. I find that the behavior occurred \nunder such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur, and it does not raise \nconcerns about his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) \napplies.  \n \nAG & 20(b) applies. The divorce Applicant sought from his wife caused the \nfinancial problems at issue in this case.  His former wife did not pay certain debts for \nwhich Applicant gave her money. Finally, he decided to file Chapter 7 bankruptcy. He \nacted responsibly in identifying and resolving these debts in that way. Then, Applicant\u2019s \nincome tax problems arose because he had custody of his two children during and after \nthe divorce. While he worked daily, he paid a child care service to watch his children \nwhen they were not in school. He resolved his tax problems when the IRS took his \nincome tax return money from tax years 1990 through 2005, being about $20,000. He \nretained a tax resolution company in 2004, after doing nothing directly to resolve the tax \ndebts between 1990 and 2004.  Applicant may have sought to negotiate with the IRS, \nbut was not successful because the IRS did not want to deal with him. His belligerent \nattitude about the problem shown at the hearing may have played a part in preventing \nany fruitful negotiations. However, he acted responsibly by filing bankruptcy on his \ndebts, and then retaining a tax resolution firm and an attorney to resolve his tax issues.  \nBoth these financial problems resulted from his divorce. \n \nAG & 20(d) applies if Applicant actively tried to resolve his debts.  He did not do \nanything proactively for over a decade about resolving the tax debts, but instead \nallowed the IRS to take his tax refunds for the years 1990 to 2005. Apparently that \nmoney was sufficient to resolve his tax liabilities and to allow the IRS to issue a Release \nof Tax Liens in June 2009. Based on those documents, the tax debts are paid. I \nconclude these potentially mitigating conditions apply. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \n\n \n6 \n \n \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 2(c) requires each case must be judged on its own merits.  Under AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant was a married adult when \nthe debts and tax liens arose in the 1980s. He voluntarily decided to reduce his tax \nwithholding in 1988 and 1989 in order to increase his monthly income, from which he \npaid for family expenses. These events occurred 20 years ago and have not been \nrepeated. He regularly pays his taxes and debts, and has since then. There is no \nlikelihood for recurrence of this activity because his children are now adults and his \nincome is sufficient to support himself and his present wife. His Chapter 7 bankruptcy \nresolved his other debts in 1987, and has not been repeated. Applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation in the 1980s was a unique event. It does not cast any doubt on his current \ntrustworthiness or reliability. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial \nconsiderations. I conclude the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept for Applicant. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\n\u201cSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry\u201d (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, \u201cDefense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program\u201d (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR (RSOR) in writing on February 3, 2010, and\nrequested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. I received the case assignment on\nMarch 8, 2010. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on March 9, 2010, and I convened the\nhearing on April 6, 2010. The Government offered Exhibits 1 through 4, which were\nreceived and entered into evidence without objection. Applicant testified on his own\nbehalf, and he submitted Exhibits A through D. Three additional witnesses testified on\nbehalf of Applicant. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr) on April 19, 2010.\n\n2\nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for\naccess to classified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his RSOR Applicant admitted SOR allegations 1.a., 1.d., and 1.e., under\nGuideline H; and 2.a. and 2.c, under Guideline E. He denied 1.b.,1.c., and 2.b. The\nadmitted allegations are incorporated herein as findings of fact. \nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including\nApplicant's RSOR, the admitted documents, and the testimony of Applicant and the\nadditional witnesses, and upon due consideration of that evidence, I make the additional\nfindings of fact: \nApplicant is 51 years old. He works as a heavy equipment operator for a defense\ncontractor, and he seeks a DoD security clearance in connection with his employment in\nthe defense sector.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline H - Drug Involvement) \nThe SOR lists five allegations regarding illegal drug involvement under\nAdjudicative Guideline H. They will be discussed in the same order as they were listed\nin the SOR:\n1.a. The SOR alleges that Applicant used marijuana from approximately 1978 to\nabout 2005. At the hearing, Applicant testified that he was a marijuana user for a long\ntime.  He stated that because he had four daughters, and one bathroom, \u201cI don\u2019t know\nwhat I would have done. It just kept me balanced. I don\u2019t know.\u201d (Tr at 97.) He conceded\nthat he used marijuana more than 200 times. (Tr at 116 - 117.)\nApplicant testified that he started working for his present employer in 2004, and\nbecause of his previous marijuana usage, he was drug tested every Monday. Yet\ndespite knowing he would be tested, he used marijuana again in 2005, when he tested\npositive.  When asked, Applicant could give no reasonable answer for this conduct.\nApplicant indicated that intends to never use marijuana again. (Exhibits 2 and 3.)  \n1.b. The SOR alleges that Applicant was arrested in June 2002 and charged with\n1) Transporting Controlled Substance, a Felony, and 2) Possession of a Controlled\nSubstance.  The charges were dismissed after Applicant completed an alcohol and drug\noffenders program for the third time. In his RSOR, Applicant denied this allegation. He\ntestified that he denied this allegation because this was his first time offense, not his\nthird, but he did concede that he was arrested and charged with possession of a\ncontrolled substance. (Tr at 115.) He estimated that he used cocaine, which he\npurchased from friends, a total of 20 times. \n1.c.  The SOR alleges that Applicant used methamphetamine from approximately\nthe late 1990s until at least 2004. In his RSOR, Applicant denied this allegation. He\n\n3\ntestified that he denied this allegation because he believed that he began using\nmethamphetamine in the early 2000s. He testified that he used methamphetamine\napproximately two or three times a week, and he estimated that his usage was less than\n50 times total. (Tr at 116 - 117.)\n 1.d. The SOR alleges that Applicant received treatment in May 2004 in a\nChemical Dependency Unity, for a condition diagnosed as Cannabis Dependence. \n1.e. The SOR alleges that Applicant tested positive for marijuana on a random\ndrug test by his employer in about May 2005 . After he tested positive, he was required\nto attend Narcotic Anonymous meetings for approximately two or three months\n1.f.  At the hearing, based on the testimony of Applicant, Department Counsel\nmoved to amend the SOR, and add the following allegation: [Applicant] \u201cused cocaine\nless than five times in the 1980s.\u201d The amendment was granted without objection and\nApplicant admitted this allegation. (Tr at 119 - 120.) \n \nParagraph 2 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct)\nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for\nclearance because he exhibited conduct involving questionable judgement, lack of\ncandor, dishonesty or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations.\n2.a. Applicant executed a Security Clearance Application (SCA), which was\ncertified on November 28, 2007.  (Exhibit 1).  Question #24 of the SCA asked since the\nage of 16 or in the previous seven years, whichever is shorter, had Applicant illegally\nused any controlled substance? Applicant answered \"No\" to this question, and he listed\nno illegal substances. The Government alleges, and the evidence is clear that Applicant\nshould have included his illegal drug usage as included in subparagraphs 1.a. and 1.c.,\nabove.  In his RSOR, Applicant admitted this allegation. \nAt the hearing Applicant gave different explanations for his answer. At one point\nApplicant testified, \u201cAll I could think of was maybe I thought it was because my charge\nwas expulsed (sic) that I didn\u2019t have to talk about that. But I know it\u2019s not - it wasn\u2019t\nabout conviction, it was about usage. I really don\u2019t have an answer for that. I just\nmarked the box wrong.\u201d (Tr at 129.) Since the questionnaire was completed and signed\nby Applicant in 2007, only two years after he tested positive for marijuana at his work\nplace and three years after his regular and long term use of marijuana and\nmethamphetamine. I do not find Applicant\u2019s explanation to be reasonable or believable. \n2.b.  During a February 8, 2008 interview with an authorized investigator for the\nDepartment of Defense, Applicant stated that he last used marijuana in June 2002, and\nhe had no intention of using it in the future. (Exhibit 3.) The SOR alleges that Applicant\ndeliberately failed to disclose that he had used marijuana until 2005, as alleged in\nsubparagraph 1. c., above.\n\n4\nIn an attempt to explain this incorrect information that Applicant provided to the\nGovernment, he testified, \u201cIt\u2019s kind of hard to recollect when you\u2019re doing drugs. You\u2019re\nmind doesn\u2019t remember a lot of things. . . You don\u2019t sit down and write a diary about\nevery time you smoke. I don\u2019t sit down and write every day that I smoked, who I smoked\nwith.\u201d \nWhile Applicant may not have remembered the specific dates that he used\nmarijuana, the date he stated he last used marijuana was a date that was documented,\nJune 2002, because of his felony arrest, as alleged in 1.b., above.  He certainly had to\nbe aware that he used marijuana after this arrest, regularly through 2004, and again in\n2005, when he tested positive for drug use at his current employer, see 1.e., above. The\nonly explanation for his furnishing this inaccurate information, about the recency and\nfrequency of his drug usage, was that he was attempting to mislead the Government in\nan attempt to minimize his drug use so that he could receive his security clearance. \n2.c.  The SOR alleges that Applicant submitted a signed, sworn statement, dated\nOctober 20, 2008, to an authorized investigator for the Department of Defense (Exhibit\n2), in which he falsified material facts by stating that he had used methamphetamine\nfrom 2002 to 2004, whereas he had used methamphetamine from at least the late\n1990s to at least 2004, as referred to in 1.c., above. The general date of the late 1990s\nthat Applicant first started using methamphetamine was provided by Applicant in Exhibit\n3. While he contradicted this in Exhibit 2, as to when he began using\nmethamphetamine, I find that this information, which was several years previous to the\nother information provided by Applicant, could have been because of Applicant\u2019s\nincorrect memory, and it has not been established that this misstatement was made to\nmislead the Government. \nMitigation\nApplicant had three additional witnesses testify on his behalf. The first was\nApplicant\u2019s older sister, who also is the President and Chief Executive Officer of the\ncompany that employs Applicant, a company with 500 to 600 employees, and a position\nthat she has held since 2001. His sister testified that Applicant informed her that he and\nhis wife were separating, and he was looking for some kind of rehabilitation program for\nhis marijuana usage. Once he completed the program, her company hired him, subject\nto his being drug tested weekly at his own expense. In May 2005, approximately one\nyear after he began employment, he tested positive for marijuana. Applicant then was\ngiven the opportunity to become involved with the Employee Assistance Program\n(EAP). She testified that he went through the program, and she now believes that he is\ntrustworthy. (Tr at 18 - 55.)\nThe second witness was the Human Resources Manger of Applicant\u2019s employer.\nShe testified that she was involved in Applicant\u2019s weekly drug testing, and that after he\ntested positive for marijuana in 2005, they considered termination, but instead gave him\nthe option of entering the EAP program, which he did. She stated that Applicant\ncompleted the program satisfactorily, and he continues to be subject to random drug\ntests.  She also testified that she believed Applicant is trustworthy. (Tr at 58 \u2013 76.)\n\n5\nThe third witness was Applicant\u2019s former brother-in-law, who is a retired Captain\nin the United States Navy. He indicated that he considers Applicant to be a brother to\nhim, and he believes that he is truthful and patriotic. He could offer no substantial\nexplanation for Applicant\u2019s failure to list his illegal drug us on his SCA. (Tr at 77 \u2013 92.)\nApplicant submitted four documentary exhibits into evidence. Exhibit A consists\nof two awards that Applicant has received from his present employer, which Applicant\u2019s\nsister indicated he received for work above and beyond normal. (Tr at 30 -31.) Exhibit B\nincludes the results of two Controlled Substance tests taken by Applicant, one on\nDecember 11, 2008, and the other on July 15, 2009. Both of the tests indicated a\nnegative result for any illegal substance present in Applicant\u2019s urine. These tests were\nordered to be taken subsequent to an accident in which Applicant was involved. \n The third exhibit consists of four character letters, one from Applicant\u2019s sister,\nthe second and third from the Human Resources Manger and the Vice President of\nOperations of Applicant\u2019s employer, and the fourth from Applicant\u2019s former brother-in-\nlaw. (Exhibit C.) All of the letters were extremely positive in describing Applicant. The\nfinal document was a signed, sworn statement of Applicant, dated April 6, 2010, in\nwhich he stated that he is not currently using illegal drugs and he promises to abstain\nfrom any illegal use in the future. (Exhibit D.)  \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief\nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially\ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\n\n6\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline H - Drug Involvement \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement is set out in\nAG \u00b6 24:  \nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may\nimpair judgement and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\nWith respect to Guideline H, the Government has established its case.\nApplicant's improper and illegal drug abuse, the use for many years of marijuana and\nmethamphetamine is of great concern, especially in light of his desire to have access to\nthe nation's secrets. Applicant's overall conduct pertaining to his illegal substance abuse\nclearly falls within Drug Involvement \u00b6 25 (a) \u201cany drug abuse,\u201d and (c) \u201cillegal drug\npossession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or\ndistribution.\u201d It also is disturbing that Applicant has used marijuana, during the period\nthat he has been working for his current employer.\nIn reviewing the mitigating conditions, I conclude that \u00b6 26 (a) \u201cthe behavior\nhappened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such circumstances that\nit is unlikely to recur again\u201d has been established in this case, because while the\nevidence has established that Applicant used methamphetamine in 2004, and marijuana\nin 2005, after he became employed at his current employer, there is no evidence that he\nhas used any illegal substance since that time.  I also find that (b) \u201ca demonstrated\n\n7\nintent not to abuse any drugs in the future\u201d is applicable, as there has been\nindependent evidence introduced to establish Applicant\u2019s veracity or credibility regarding\nhis intent not to abuse drugs in the future. \nIn this case, the Government has met its initial burden of proving by substantial\nevidence that Applicant has used illegal drugs for many years under Guideline H.\nApplicant, on the other hand, has introduced persuasive evidence in rebuttal,\nexplanation or mitigation, which is sufficient to overcome the Government's case against\nhim.  Accordingly, Paragraph 1, Guideline H, of the SOR is concluded for Applicant.\nGuideline E - Personal Conduct \nWith respect to Guideline E, the evidence establishes that Applicant furnished to\nthe Government incomplete, untruthful answers regarding the extent of his drug\ninvolvement on an SCA that he executed on November 28, 2007, and during an\ninterview with a Government investigator on February 8, 2008.\nThe Government relies heavily on the honesty and integrity of individuals seeking\naccess to our nation\u2019s secrets. When such an individual intentionally falsifies material\nfacts or fails to furnish relevant information to a Government investigator, it is extremely\ndifficult to conclude that he nevertheless possesses the judgment, and honesty\nnecessary for an individual given a clearance. In this case, I conclude that Applicant\nknowingly and willingly failed to give complete, honest answers regarding his drug\nusage to the Government.\nIn reviewing the Disqualifying Conditions (DC) under Guideline E, I conclude that\nAG \u00b6 16 (a) applies because of Applicant\u2019s \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or\nfalsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, used to . . .\ndetermine security clearance eligibility.\u201d AG \u00b6 16 (b) also applies since Applicant\n\u201cdeliberately provid[ed] false relevant information to the Government investigator.\u201d His\nuse of marijuana after he began working for his current employer when he knew that he\nwas subjected to weekly drug testing, also shows extremely questionable judgement. I\ncan not find that any Mitigating Condition (MC) applies in this paragraph.  \nApplicant\u2019s conduct, considered as a whole, exhibits questionable judgement,\nunreliability, and a lack of candor. I resolve Paragraph 2, Guideline E, against Applicant.\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\n\n8\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2 (c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \nI have considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions under\nGuidelines H and E in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case.\nBased on all of the reasons cited above, including Applicant\u2019s long history of using\nmarijuana and other illegal drugs, and his lack of honesty and candor with the\ninformation he furnished to the Government, I find that the record evidence leaves me\nwith serious questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security\nclearance under the whole-person concept. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant\nhas not mitigated the security concerns. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline H:   \nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a. -1.f.:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST  APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a.-2.b.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c.:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \nMartin H. Mogul\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The SOR alleges seven factual allegations under the sexual behavior guideline, and five allegations under the personal conduct guideline. Applicant admitted all allegations. Applicant, 48 years old, has been married to his wife since May 1991, and has two children, ages 15 and 17. He has been employed as a principal engineer at his current job since March 1999. He served in the United States Army from September 1980 to September 1984, and received an honorable discharge. Applicant, who has held a security clearance since at least December 1990, seeks to have his security clearance continued. Sexual Behavior The allegations under sexual behavior are based on interviews Applicant participated in with another agency of the DoD on June 8 and July 19, 2006. He was asked to explain his involvement in child pornography and sexual encounters with juveniles since he has been an adult. After the July 19, 2006 interview, Applicant\u2019s access to special compartmented information (SCI) was suspended. On December 22, 2006, Applicant\u2019s (SCI) access was revoked by the agency. On March 1, 2007, Applicant appealed the revocation decision, and on March 6, 2007, the agency denied Applicant\u2019s appeal. A record of interviews and official decisions of the investigation are included in Item 5 of the FORM. On June 8, 2006, Applicant was interviewed by a DoD investigator in connection with his reinvestigation for SCI access. He provided the following information: He received fellatio fro",

Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMASON, Paul J., Administrative Judge:\nBased on the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and statements, Applicant\u2019s eligibility\nfor access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SCA) on May 29, 2007.\nOn November 26, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under sexual behavior\n(Guideline D), and personal conduct (Guideline E). The action was taken pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February\n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended\n(Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President\non December 29, 2005, and made effective within the Department of Defense for SORs\nissued on or after September 1, 2006. \nMay 15, 2009\n\n2\nApplicant submitted his answer to the SOR on May 12, 2008. He requested a\ndecision be made on the record in lieu of a hearing. A copy of the Government\u2019s File of\nRelevant Material (FORM, the government\u2019s evidence in support of the allegations in\nthe SOR) was sent to Applicant on February 24, 2009. He received the FORM on\nFebruary 26, 2009. His response was due by March 28, 2009. No response was\nreceived.\nFindings of Fact\nThe SOR alleges seven factual allegations under the sexual behavior guideline,\nand five allegations under the personal conduct guideline. Applicant admitted all\nallegations. Applicant, 48 years old, has been married to his wife since May 1991, and\nhas two children, ages 15 and 17. He has been employed as a principal engineer at his\ncurrent job since March 1999. He served in the United States Army from September\n1980 to September 1984, and received an honorable discharge. Applicant, who has\nheld a security clearance since at least December 1990, seeks to have his security\nclearance continued. \nSexual Behavior \nThe allegations under sexual behavior are based on interviews Applicant\nparticipated in with another agency of the DoD on June 8 and July 19, 2006. He was\nasked to explain his involvement in child pornography and sexual encounters with\njuveniles since he has been an adult. After the July 19, 2006 interview, Applicant\u2019s\naccess to special compartmented information (SCI) was suspended. On December 22,\n2006, Applicant\u2019s (SCI) access was revoked by the agency. On March 1, 2007,\nApplicant appealed the revocation decision, and on March 6, 2007, the agency denied\nApplicant\u2019s appeal. A record of interviews and official decisions of the investigation are\nincluded in Item 5 of the FORM.\nOn June 8, 2006, Applicant was interviewed by a DoD investigator in connection\nwith his reinvestigation for SCI access. He provided the following information: He\nreceived fellatio from a 15-year-old female in 1986 (SOR 1.a.). In 1987 and 1995,\nApplicant looked in the window of a neighbor\u2019s residence and through the window of his\nresidence to see her in the nude (SOR 1.b.). In 1990 (SOR 1.c.), he inserted his hand\nunderneath the clothes of a 16-year-old female, touching her vaginal area. He decided\nshe was too young for sex. Around 1996 and 2005 (SOR 1.d.), he used women\u2019s\nunderwear to masturbate. In 2003 (SOR 1.e.), Applicant posted a nude photograph of\nhis wife on the Internet without her knowledge. From approximately 2003 to 2005,\nApplicant downloaded from the Internet to his home personal computer pictures of\nfemales under the age of 18 (SOR 1.f.). He kept some of the sexually explicit pictures of\nfemales under the age of 18 until at least 2006 (SOR 1.g.). \nDuring the second agency interview on July 19, 2006, Applicant indicated he was\ninitially repulsed by the child pornography, but the more he viewed the pictures, the less\nuncomfortable he felt about the pictures\u2019 contents. Applicant admitted he was attracted\n\n3\nto younger women between the ages of 18 and 22. He was also attracted to juvenile\nwomen who had fully developed breasts and pubic hair (Item 5). From 2003 to\nSeptember 2005, Applicant estimated downloading and saving 20 to 30 sets of child\npornography, with each set containing 20 to 30 photographs. The sets included nude\nphotographs of females between 13 and 17 years old. Applicant protected the\npornography on his home computer with encrypted software or a special cable because\nof the illegal nature of the pictures, and to prevent his wife from viewing the pictures. \nIn his March 1, 2007 appeal of the initial decision to revoke his SCI, Applicant\nrecalled his childhood and teenage life in his community where 90% of the females,\nages 15 or older, were engaged in sexual activity. Applicant noted that his contact with\nunderage females occurred 20 or more years ago. Regarding the posting of his wife\u2019s\npicture on the Internet, Applicant explained that the two photos were posted to an \u201cadult\nnews group\u201d in an unidentifiable form revealing only partial nudity. In addition, the photo\nheaders had a disclaimer warning that restricted viewing of individuals 18 or older.\nApplicant also indicated the photos were not \u201cthumbnail,\u201d and required the viewer to\nspecifically download the file to open (Item 5). No additional information was furnished. \nAlso in Applicant\u2019s March 1, 2007 appeal letter, he disputed the investigator\u2019s\nclaim that he had illegal pornography in his computer at the time of the examination in\nJuly 2006. Applicant claimed he had no specific recollection of viewing illegal\npornography in 2005, 2006 or 2007. While he had hundreds of photographs, he was\ncertain only about 10% of the photos showed any nudity at all. Applicant did not (as the\nItem 5 agency memorandum claims) masturbate while reviewing photos of females less\nthan 13 years of age. Applicant also protested he was not provided food in the six or\nseven-hour interview in July 2006. Finally, he stated he is not proud of his behavior with\nunderage females or his downloading/viewing of child pornography. Applicant considers\nthe conduct in his past. He concluded his appeal statement in Item 5 by stating that his\ninterview responses in July 2006 were provided in a manner that would reduce the\nchances of leaving out any detail. On reflection, he may have provided too much\ninformation because he was uncertain about some of the activity or conduct (Id.).\nOn March 6, 2007, the original decision to revoke Applicant\u2019s SCI was affirmed.\nThe reviewer noted that Applicant was under oath during the interview on July 19, 2006,\nand was reminded he was under oath as the gathered information was summarized.\nThe reviewer concluded the information that was affirmed by Applicant was too detailed\nto be to be simply tossed out by his claims that the information was false and/or that\ninterviewer misinterpreted him. Finally, the reviewer confirmed that Applicant was\nprovided several breaks during the examination, and a 78 minute lunch break (Id.). \nIn his interview with an investigator from the Office of Personnel Management\n(OPM) on August 9, 2007 (Item 7, contained in interrogatory answers dated June 16,\n2008), Applicant unequivocally stated that the downloading and viewing of child\npornography lasted only a month in 2003, rather than the lengthy period of time detailed\nin his interviews in July 2006. Applicant stated after reviewing the interview on June 16,\n2008, that: the downloading (and storage on compact discs (CDs)) and viewing lasted\n\n4\nseveral months, ending in early 2004; the CDs were stored in an inaccessible location\nfor more than two years, with Applicant accessing the pictures once or twice; the last\ntime he downloaded any illegal material was in November 2004; and, he discarded all\nthe CDs in May 2006 without looking at any of the pictures. Applicant concluded the\nJune 2008 statement by indicating he was ashamed at being involved in the activity,\nand did not intend to get involved in the behavior in the future. \nPersonal Conduct \nDuring a personnel screening interview in approximately 1980, Applicant told an\ninvestigator he used marijuana about five times with friends between 1976 and 1978.\nApplicant admitted in his answer to the SOR that he deliberately tried to conceal\nmarijuana use of 50 to 100 times (SOR 2.b.). Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana in the U.S.\nArmy on one occasion in 1981, and on one occasion in July 1982 (SOR 2.c.), occurred\nafter he told an investigator he would not use marijuana in the future (SOR 2.d.).\nApplicant\u2019s SCI access was revoked in March 2007 (SOR 2.e.). \nCharacter Evidence\nApplicant was advised when he received the FORM on February 26, 2009 that\nhe could file objections to the information included in the FORM or supply additional\nmaterial in support of any claims he wanted to advance. He provided no information.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are flexible rules of law. Recognizing the complexities of human\nbehavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the\nadjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s ultimate adjudicative goal is a fair,\nimpartial and common sense decision. According to the AG, the entire process is a\ncareful, thorough evaluation of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person\nconcept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable information\nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. If residual\ndoubts still remain concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\ninformation, those doubts will be resolved in favor of national security. In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\n\n5\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\nis not restricted to normal duty hours. Rather, the relationship is an-around-the-clock\nresponsibility between an applicant and the federal government. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\nAnalysis\nSexual Behavior (SB)\n\u00b6 12. The Concern. Sexual behavior that involves a criminal offense, indicates a\npersonality or emotional disorder, reflects a lack of judgment or discretion, or which may\nsubject the individual to undue influence or coercion, exploitation, or duress can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation. No adverse inference concerning the standards in the Guideline may be\nraised solely on the basis of the sexual orientation of the individual. \nThe sexual behavior that Applicant engaged in the 1980s, 1990s, and also\nbetween 2003 and 2006 falls within the scope of SB disqualifying condition (DC) \u00b6 13.a.\n(sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has been\nprosecuted). Downloading and viewing the numerous child pornography photos is\nclearly sexual behavior of a criminal nature. Engaging in sexual behavior with underage\nfemales, e.g., fellatio and fondling, also represents criminal behavior regardless of\nwhether the individual was ever prosecuted. \nApplicant was troubled when he first viewed the pornography. However, his\nfeelings changed as he viewed more child pornography. The repetitive nature of his\nbehavior between 2003 and September 2005 invokes SB DC \u00b6 13.b. (a pattern of\ncompulsive, self-destructive, or high risk behavior that the person is unable to stop or\nthat may be symptomatic of a personality disorder). \nSB DC \u00b6 13.c. (sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress) applies because Applicant is still uncomfortable about\nhis conduct with the underage females and the child pornography. Since his\nexamination in July 2006 with the other agency of the DoD regarding continued SCI\n\n6\naccess, Applicant has furnished statements about the information he provided in July\n2006. In his March 2007 appeal, he essentially disowned a substantial amount of\ninformation concerning the sexual behavior. In his August 2007 interview, and his\ninterrogatory responses in June 2008, he disavowed other portions of his July 2006\ninterviews, while also claiming the pornography lasted only a month or a few months.\nApplicant\u2019s retraction of increasing amounts of information since his interviews in July\n2006 indicate to me he is minimizing and/or rationalizing the full scope of his conduct,\nthus making him vulnerable to duress within the ambit of SB DC \u00b6 13.c, as well as the\npersonal conduct guideline discussed below.  \nSB DC \u00b6 13.d. (sexual behavior of a public nature and/or that reflects a lack of\njudgment or judgment) also applies based on Applicant\u2019s poor judgment between 1986\nand 2006. \nThe SB guideline identifies four mitigating conditions (MC) that have been\nconsidered. SB MC \u00b6 14.a. (the behavior occurred prior to or during adolescence and\nthere is no evidence of subsequent conduct) is not available for mitigation as the\nbehavior began after Applicant became an adult and lasted until 2006. \nSB MC \u00b6 14.b. (the sexual behavior happened a long time ago, so infrequently,\nor under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual\u2019s current reliability, untrustworthiness, or good judgment) may apply if\nthe conduct occurred a long time ago, was infrequent, or occurred under unusual\ncircumstances. While there is no indication of sexual misconduct with juveniles after\n1990, Applicant continued to engage in masturbation followed by extensive child\npornography activity between 2003 and the second half of 2005, and retained some of\nthe sexually explicit pictures of females under 18 years old until 2006. The 20-year-\nhistory of sexual behavior, specifically the period after 1990 when Applicant held SCI\naccess in addition to a security clearance, continues to have a negative impact on his\ncredibility, trustworthiness and good judgment. \nApplicant has provided insufficient evidence to activate SB MC \u00b6 14.c. (the\nbehavior no longer serves as the basis for coercion, exploitation, or duress). Though an\napplicant is not required to stand on a street corner and boast about his sexual\nbehavior, he should furnish adequate evidence to show the behavior could not be used\nas a basis for coercion. Applicant has not met his burden under this mitigator. SB MC \u00b6\n14.d. (the sexual behavior is strictly private, consensual, and discreet) is inapplicable\nbecause Applicant\u2019s sexual activity with juveniles and his viewing of child pornography\nwas illegal. Applicant exhibited poor judgment in 1986 when he engaged in fellatio with\na 15-year-old female, and fondled a 16-year-old in 1990. Applicant\u2019s lack of judgment\ncontinued with the peeping tom activity in between 1987 and 1995. Applicant\nmasturbated in 1996 and 2004 to women\u2019s underwear. Considering the totality of\nincidents between 1986 and 2006, and particularly the child pornography activity\nbetween 2003 and 2006, the government has established a case under the SB\nguideline that has not been mitigated. \n\n7\nPersonal Conduct (PC)\n\u00b6 15. The Concern. \u201cConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified\ninformation. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers\nduring the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security\nclearance process.\u201d\nPC DC \u00b6 16.d. (credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under\nany other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse determination, but\nwhich, when combined with all available information supports a whole person\nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor,\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating\nthat the person may not properly safeguard protected information. This includes but is\nnot limited to consideration of: (1) or unreliable behavior to include breach of client\nconfidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized release of sensitive\ncorporate or other government protected information; and (3) a pattern of dishonesty or\nrule violations) applies based on Applicant\u2019s sexual behavior between 1986 and 2006,\ncoupled with the serious falsifications and misrepresentations he made about his\nmarijuana use, and use of the drug while in the U.S. Army. The falsifications and sexual\nbehavior raise ongoing concerns about Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness and judgment. \nThe sources for exploitation and duress discussed under the SB guideline also\nexist under PC DC \u00b6 16.e. (personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s\nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as (1)\nengaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s personal, professional, or\ncommunity standing . . . ). Applicant clearly did not want anyone to know about his child\npornography activity based on his use of encrypted software and special cables. His\nminimization of the activity increases his vulnerability to coercion under this disqualifying\ncondition. \nPC MC \u00b6 17.d. (the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained\ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the\nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other\ninappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur) receives limited\napplication, but does not meet his ultimate burden of persuasion under the PC\nguideline. While Applicant acknowledges the illegality of the child pornography, there is\nno indication he has received any counseling for the behavior. Unless evidence is\nprovided on the issue, there is no way for me to determine what action Applicant has\ntaken to alleviate the stressors, and prevent the child pornography and other sexual\nactivity from resurfacing in the future. \nI have examined the evidence with the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in\nmy ultimate finding against Applicant under the SB and PC guidelines. The case still\nmust be weighed within the context of nine variables known as the whole person\n\n8\nconcept. In evaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the administrative judge\nshould consider the following factors: \n\u00b6 2.a. (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich the participation was voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and, (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nApplicant provided false information about his drug use in 1980. In 1986 he\nreceived fellatio from a 15-year-old juvenile female. In 1987 and 1995, he engaged in\npeeping tom activity. In 1990, he fondled a 16-year-old female. From 2003 to 2006,\nwhile holding SCI and collateral access, he engaged in a pattern of extensive child\npornography activity because of his attraction for young women and developed juvenile\nfemales. Though Applicant indicated he is ashamed of his despicable behavior, given\nthe lack of counseling and/or other steps taken to relieve his stressors, it is too soon to\nconclude he is rehabilitated. Accordingly, I find Applicant has not overcome the adverse\nevidence under the SB and PC guidelines. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1 (Sexual Behavior, Guideline D):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.\nAgainst Appellant\nSubparagraph 1.c\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g.\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2 (Personal Conduct, Guideline E): \nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.d.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.e.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.f.\nAgainst Applicant.\n\n9\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n                       \nPaul J. Mason\nAdministrative Judge\n",

The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by Applicant are adopted as relevant and material findings. Additional findings follow. Applicant\u2019s background Applicant was born in Lebanon and immigrated to the U.S. in 1980 to pursue his education (R.T., at 53-55). Aided by financial assistance from his parents, he earned a bachelors degree with highest honors from an accredited U.S. university in 1982 and a master of science degree in 1985 (see exs. 1 and B; R.T., at 56). He currently owns a limited liability company that is certified by his state (see ex. F; R.T., at 72). He documents a lengthy history of involvement in federal programs (see ex. A; R.T., at 69- 70) and property ownership in the U.S. (see ex. E; R.T., at 64, 71). Applicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen in September 1999 and acquired a U.S. passport the same month and year (see ex. 1; R.T., at 53-55). He used his Lebanese passport to enter and exit Lebanon before he obtained his U.S. passport. Since obtaining his U.S. passport, he has never used his Lebanese passport (R.T., at 4 55). His Lebanese passport was issued in September 1992, and was renewed in August 1997 (see ex. 1). It expired in August 2002. Applicant retained his old Lebanese passport for many years after its expiration (see ex. 3; R.T., at 73). He found it in old papers and did not retain for any intentional reasons (R.T., at",

The case\nwas assigned to me on February 18, 2009, and was scheduled for hearing on March 25,\n2009.  For good cause shown, the scheduled hearing was continued, and rescheduled\nfor April 14, 2009.  A hearing was convened on the rescheduled date, for the purpose of\nconsidering whether it would be clearly consistent with the national interest to grant,\ncontinue, deny, or revoke Applicant\u2019s security clearance.  At hearing, the Government's\nJune 30, 2009\n\n2\ncase consisted of two exhibits; Applicant relied on one witness (himself) and six exhibits.\nThe transcript (R.T.) was received on April 22, 2009.  Based upon a review of the case\nfile, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility to access classified information is\ngranted.\nBesides its two exhibits, the Government requested administrative notice of 14\ndocuments:  Background Note: Lebanon, U.S. Department of State (January 2009);\nCountry Specific Information, Lebanon, U.S. Department of State (August 2008); Travel\nWarning, Lebanon, U.S. Department of State (September 2008); Country Reports on\nHuman Rights Practices - 2007, Lebanon, U.S. Department of State (March 2008);\nCountry Reports on Terrorism, Chapter 2 - Country Reports: Middle East and North\nAfrica Overview, U.S. Department of State (April 2008); Country Reports on Terrorism,\nChapter 3 - State Sponsors of Terrorism Overview, U.S. Department of State (April\n2008); Country Reports on Terrorism, Chapter 6 - Terrorist Organizations, U.S.\nDepartment of State (April 2008); United States Condemns Violence in Lebanon,  U.S.\nDepartment of State (May 2008); Remarks after Meeting with Lebanese Parliamentary\nSpeaker Nabih Berri, U.S. Department of State (June 2008); Terror Attack in Lebanon,\nU.S. Department of State (August 2008); United States Condemns Car Bomb Attack in\nLebanon, U.S. Department of State (September 2008); Bus Bombing in Tripoli, U.S.\nDepartment of State (September 2008); Naji Antoine Abi Khalil Sentenced to 60 Months\nImprisonment for Attempting to Export Military Night-Vision Equipment to Hizballah, U.S.\nDepartment of Commerce (February 2006); Michigan Man Pleads Guilty to Supporting\nHizballah, U.S. Department of Justice (November 2007).  \nAdministrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for\nadministrative proceedings.  See ISCR Case No. 05-11292, at 4 n.1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12,\n2007); ISCR Case No. 02-24875, at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2006)(citing ISCR Case No. 02-\n18668, at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2004)).  Administrative notice is appropriate for noticing\nfacts or government reports that are well known.  See Stein, Administrative Law, Sec.\n25.01 (Bender & Co. 2006).  For good cause shown, administrative notice was granted\nwith respect to the contents of the above-named background reports addressing the\ngeopolitical situation in Lebanon, and other facts pertinent to national security\nconsiderations in the country.  Administrative notice was extended to the documents\nthemselves, consistent  with the provisions of Rule 201 of Fed. R. Evid.  This notice did\nnot foreclose Applicant from challenging the accuracy and reliability of the information\ncontained in the reports. Applicant exercised his option of challenging these documents.\nProcedural Issues and Rulings\nBefore the close of the hearing, Applicant requested leave to supplement the\nrecord to afford him an opportunity to provide documentation of his surrendered expired\nLebanese passport, his community involvement in the U.S., Lebanese sponsored tourist\nencouragement, and UN developments in its investigation of the 2005 assassination of\nthen prime minister Rafiq Hariri, and written character endorsements.   For good cause\nshown, Applicant was granted seven days to supplement the record.  The Government\nwas afforded three days to respond.  Within the time permitted, Applicant e-mailed his\n\n3\naffidavit concerning his surrender of his passport and intention to renounce his Lebanese\ncitizenship, confirmation of his surrender of his passport to his facility clearance officer\n(FSO), UN materials covering Lebanon developments, endorsements and biographical\nmaterials, which were, in turn, furnished me by Department Counsel.  Department\nCounsel did not object or provide rebuttal documentation. Applicant\u2019s submissions are\nadmitted as Applicant\u2019s exhibits G through O. \nSummary of Pleadings\n                                       \nUnder Guideline C, Applicant is alleged to (a) have exercised dual citizenship with\nLebanon and the U.S., (b) possess an expired Lebanese passport, and (c) unwilling to\nrenounce his Lebanese citizenship.\nUnder Guideline B, Applicant is alleged to have (a) a father who is a citizen and\nresident of Lebanon, (b) two sisters who are citizens and residents of Lebanon, (c) a\nbrother who is a dual citizen of Canada and Lebanon who resides in Saudi Arabia, and\n(d) traveled to Lebanon on average of at least once per year. \nFor his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted to his being a dual citizen of\nLebanon and the U.S. and possessing an expired Lebanese passport.  He also admitted\nto having immediate family members who are citizens and residents of Lebanon, and a\nbrother who is a dual citizen of Canada and Lebanon.  And he admitted to traveling to\nLebanon on average at least once per year.  Applicant added no explanations or\naffirmative claims to his answer.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 49-year-old program manager for a defense contractor who seeks a\nsecurity clearance.  The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by Applicant are\nadopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional findings follow.\nApplicant\u2019s background\nApplicant was born in Lebanon and immigrated to the U.S. in 1980 to pursue his\neducation (R.T., at 53-55).  Aided by financial assistance from his parents, he earned a\nbachelors degree with highest honors from an accredited U.S. university in 1982 and a\nmaster of science degree in 1985 (see exs. 1 and B; R.T., at 56).  He currently owns a\nlimited liability company that is certified by his state (see ex. F; R.T., at 72).  He\ndocuments a lengthy history of involvement in federal programs (see ex. A; R.T., at 69-\n70) and property ownership in the U.S. (see ex. E; R.T., at 64, 71). \nApplicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen in September 1999 and acquired a\nU.S. passport the same month and year (see ex. 1; R.T., at 53-55).  He  used his\nLebanese passport to enter and exit Lebanon before he obtained his U.S. passport.\nSince obtaining his U.S. passport, he has never used his Lebanese passport (R.T., at\n\n4\n55).  His Lebanese passport was issued in September 1992, and was renewed in August\n1997 (see ex. 1).  It expired in August 2002. \nApplicant retained his old Lebanese passport for many years after its expiration\n(see ex. 3; R.T., at 73).  He found it in old papers and did not retain for any intentional\nreasons (R.T., at 73-74).  He documents his surrendering his Lebanese passport to his\nfacility clearance officer (FSO) in April 2009 (see ex. I).  In the past, he has declined to\nrenounce his Lebanese citizenship.  He assures (accepted) he was never asked to\nrenounce his Lebanese citizenship by U.S. State Department officials.  To successfully\nrenounce his Lebanese citizenship, he would need to demonstrate a conflict of interest\nwith his U.S. citizenship.  He did indicate at hearing his willingness to renounce his\nLebanese citizenship should it become necessary to obtain his security clearance (R.T.,\nat 8). In his post-hearing affidavit, though, he confirmed his willingness to unconditionally\nrenounce his Lebanon citizenship (see ex. G). \nApplicant\u2019s mother was a citizen and resident of Lebanon before her death in\n2006 (R.T., at 57, 74).  His father is 86 years of age and is a citizen/resident of Lebanon.\nHe currently resides with Applicant\u2019s eldest sister in the Christian sector of Beirut (R.T.,\nat 80, 90).  \nApplicant has two sisters who are citizens and residents of Lebanon.  His oldest\nsister is unmarried, works for a Lebanese construction firm, and spends much of her time\ncaring for their father (R.T., at 62).  His youngest sister is married, has four children, and\nis a homemaker (R.T., at 62).  Her husband is employed in the construction business\nand has no known connections to the Lebanese government. \nBesides his two sisters, Applicant has two brothers (R.T., at 60-61).  His oldest\nbrother is a dual citizen of Lebanon and Canada and currently resides in Saudi Arabia\n(R.T., at 61, 81).  He works for a British insurance company and has no relationships of\nany kind with the Lebanese government (R.T., at 60-61).  His youngest brother is a dual\ncitizen of the U.S. and Lebanon and resides in the U.S.  He has worked for most of his\ncareer for a major U.S. corporation and is currently on assignment in Korea (R.T., at 61).\nHis wife is a homemaker and has no associations with any members of the Lebanon\ngovernment (R.T., at 61-62).  \nNone of Applicant\u2019s immediate family members (i.e., his father and siblings)\nresiding in Lebanon have served in the Lebanon military, participated in Lebanese civil\nwars, or been imprisoned or detained (R.T., at 82).  Applicant himself does not know any\none associated with a non-government organization (NGO) in Lebanon.  \nSince becoming a U.S. citizen, Applicant has made several trips to Lebanon to\nvisit his parents and siblings.  He traveled to Lebanon in 2007 to see his family, and\nstayed with his family during his visit (R.T., at 73-74).  In 2006 he traveled to Lebanon to\nattend his mother\u2019s funeral (R.T., at 74).  Because of his father\u2019s poor health\n(Alzheimer\u2019s) , he may need to see him in the near future (R.T., at 56-57, 88).  Besides\n\n5\nhis trips to Lebanon, Applicant speaks to his sisters and brothers monthly (R.T., at 83-\n84).  He has aunts in Lebanon, too, that he keeps in touch with. \nApplicant never voted in Lebanese elections or served in the Lebanese military\n(see ex. 2; R.T., at 59).  He has never sought or held political office in Lebanon.  He has\nno property or other financial interests or inheritance expectancies in Lebanon, and has\nnever performed or attempted to perform duties, or otherwise acted so as to serve the\ninterests of Lebanon in preference to the interests of the U.S., since becoming a U.S.\ncitizen (ex. 2; R.T., at 56, 78-79).  To the contrary, he takes an active interest in U.S.\npolitical elections and has donated to U.S. political candidates (R.T., at 59-60).\nApplicant has no intention of returning to Lebanon to reside (R.T., at 78), and has\nnever been detained by Lebanese government officials.  He provides some financial\nassistance to his immediate family in Lebanon (R.T., at 74-77).  He wire transferred\n$2,000.00 to fund his mother\u2019s operation before her death and smaller contributions to\nunderwrite other medical and living expenses (R.T., at 75).  \nHistorical background of Lebanon\nSince gaining independence, in 1943, Lebanon has enjoyed a somewhat\ncheckered history: interspersed with periods of political upheaval and relative prosperity.\nBeirut has a lengthy history as an important regional finance and trade center (see\nBackground Note: Lebanon, supra, at 3).  Political and economic conditions on the\nground in Lebanon continue to remain fluid and subject to change.\nPalestinian refugee camps emerged in Lebanon in the early 1970s, following the\n1967 Arab-Israeli war, and the ensuing secret 1969 Cairo Agreement permitting the\nestablishment of Palestinian camps in Lebanon (id.).   Since 1979, Lebanon has been in\na state of war with Israel and still does not recognize Israel\u2019s right to exist (see id, at 3;\nTravel Warning, Lebanon, supra, at 1).  \nFull scale civil war erupted in Lebanon in 1975 between Christians and Palestinian\nforces combined with leftist Muslim factions.  As the fighting spread through most of the\ncountry, Lebanon\u2019s president called for support from Syrian troops.  A formed Arab\nDeterrent Force (which included Syrian troops already present) was deployed to help\nstaunch  the violence (see Background Note: Lebanon, supra, at 3).\nConditions in Lebanon deteriorated in 1978 following a PLO attack on an Israel\nbus that caused heavy casualties. The incident prompted Israel to invade Lebanon in\nMarch 1978.  Reacting to Israel\u2019s invasion of Lebanon, the UN Security Council passed\nResolution 425, which called for the immediate withdrawal of Israeli forces and created\nthe UN Interim force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) to maintain the peace.  \nIntermittent peace and terrorist activity followed an interim cease-fire in 1981,\nwhich the U.S, supported.  In May 2000, Lebanon, Israel and the U.S. signed an\nagreement for Israel\u2019s withdrawal, conditioned on the departure of Syrian troops (see\n\n6\nBackground Note: Lebanon, supra, at 4).  When Syria refused to sign the agreement,\nIsrael withdrew unilaterally from the Shif sector (south of Beirut), leaving the warring\nDruze and Christian militias without a buffer.  The Druze subsequently gained control of\nthe Shif region, which in itself triggered a virtual collapse of the Lebanese Army in\nFebruary 1984 (id.).  With the Army\u2019s collapse, terrorist activity in Lebanon increased,\nand radical Muslim factions began their ascent.  \nFactional conflicts in Lebanon increased between 1975 and 1989, as\nreconciliation efforts faltered.  Political conditions remained unstable throughout this\nperiod (see Background Note: Lebanon, supra, at 5).  \nAfter the adoption of the Ta\u2019if Agreement in 1989, political conditions in Lebanon\nimproved for awhile (see Background Note: Lebanon, supra, at 5).  In August 1990, the\nLebanese parliament and the country\u2019s new president came to terms on constitutional\namendments that included some of the political reforms envisioned in the Ta\u2019if\nAgreement.  Postwar reconstruction (1992-2005) was marked by economic uncertainty\nand the collapse of the Lebanese currency (id.).\nBy 2005, Syria\u2019s military and intelligence presence in Lebanon had grown\nconsiderably.  Historically, Syria claimed territory in Lebanon as its own, and never\nsigned a boundary agreement with Lebanon, or fulfilled its numerous pledges to\nestablish full diplomatic relations with Lebanon (see Background Note: Lebanon, supra,\nat 6).  The UN Security Council expressed its concerns over the diplomatic impasse by\nadopting Resolution 1559 in September 2004.  Resolution 1559 called for withdrawal of\nall remaining foreign forces from Lebanon, the disbanding and disarmament of all\nLebanese and non-Lebanese militias, the deployment of the Lebanese Armed Forces\n(LAF) throughout the country, and a free and fair electoral process in the scheduled\npresidential election (id.).\nResolution 1559 was never fully honored by Syria and other non-governmental\norganizations (primarily Hizballah) that operated mainly in the south.   Fueled by massive\nprotests over the assassination of prime minister Rafiq Hariri in 2005 and the\ninternational pressures brought to bear on Syria, Syrian military troops were fully\nwithdrawn in April 2005 (see Background Note: Lebanon, supra, at 7). \nFollowing the murders of prominent Lebanese journalists investigating the\nassassination of the prime minister and political leaders, a UN Int\u2019l Independent\nInvestigative Commission (UNITIC) was formed to investigate Prime Minister Rafiq\nHariri\u2019s assassination and related crimes (id.).  In December 2006, the Lebanese cabinet\napproved an agreement with the UN Security Counsel to create a special tribunal with\nresponsibility for trying those who might be indicted as a result of the investigation (id.). \nIn March 2009, the U.S. State Department announced the opening of the Special UN\nTribunal for Lebanon whose mission is to hold accountable those found to be\nresponsible for the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Hariri (see ex.   L).\n\n1\n         In recent elections, Sa\u2019ad Hariri (son of the assassinated former prime minister) successfully put together a coalition\nthat prevailed over Hizbollah\u2019s major opposition .  Hariri\u2019s election is not enough to warrant opening the record at this\ntime to explore the implications of whether this election is likely to produce a stronger central government.  Time will\ntell.  The new prime minister pledges to concentrate resources on rebuilding the LAR and the Internal Security Forces\n(see election report in Washington Post, at A15 (June 13, 2009).\n7\nLebanese parliamentary elections were held in May 2005, and the anti-Syrian\nopposition headed by the late prime minister\u2019s son (Sa\u2019ad Hariri) won a majority of the 72\nseats (see Background Note: Lebanon, supra, at 7).  Parliament, in turn, approved the\nfirst \u201cmade in Lebanon cabinet\u201d in almost 30 years in July 2005 (id.).  The published\ncabinet\u2019s agenda highlighted political and economic reforms, but also recognized\nHizballah\u2019s right to possess military weapons to employ resistence initiatives against\nperceived Israeli occupiers of Lebanese territory.\nHizballah sponsored terrorist actions erupted in July 2006 when Hizballah\nguerrillas invaded Israel, killed three Israeli soldiers, and precipitated a war with Israel\n(see Background Note: Lebanon, supra, at 8).  When hostilities wound down in August\n2006, significant casualties were reported on both sides.  UN Resolution 1701 (ending\nthe war) provided for a cease-fire, Israeli withdrawal of its troops and lifting of its\nblockades, disarming of Hizballah and other militias, and a ban on unauthorized\nweapons transfers into Lebanon (id.).  UN resolution 1701 strengthened UNIFIL\u2019s\nmandate and authorized its enlargement from about 2,000 members to a maximum of\n15,000.  With the added support of UNIFIL, the LAF were able to forcefully deploy their\nmilitary units in southern Lebanon and Israel\u2019s border for the first time in almost four\ndecades (id.).\nAlthough Syria withdrew its military resources from Lebanon as directed by UN\nResolution 1701, it has continued to maintain a strong influence in Lebanon policies with\nthe clear objective of paralyzing and undermining Lebanon\u2019s cabinet (see Background\nNote: Lebanon, supra; R.T., at 94-96).  Political conditions in Lebanon remain guarded,\nbut hopeful.    Parliamentary elections scheduled for early June 2009 promised to have\n1\ninternational observers in Applicant\u2019s view (R.T., at 118).\nPolitical and economic makeup of Lebanon\nOfficial State Department records document that Lebanon is a parliamentary\ndemocracy.  Since the institution of a power sharing arrangement in 1990, Lebanon has\noperated under a constitutionally established central government. Structurally, Lebanon\u2019s\nconstitution provides for direct elections every four years.  By the terms of the 1943\nnational pact (an unwritten agreement) establishing the foundations of Lebanon\u2019s\nmodern political system, power is allocated on an essentially confessional system based\non the 1932 census (see Background Note: Lebanon, supra, at 8).  Until 1990, seats\nwere divided according to a 6 to 5 ration of Christians to Muslims (Druzes were counted\nas Muslims).  This ratio was changed to a 50-50 ratio in the Ta\u2019if Agreement.   Public\npositions are similarly allocated with the top three positions allocated as follows:\nPresidency (to a Maronite Christian), prime minister (to a Sunni Muslim), and speaker of\n\n8\nthe Parliament (to a Shi-a Muslim (see id.).  This political make-up of the country is fully\nconsistent with Applicant\u2019s personal understanding of Lebanon\u2019s operational political\ncurrently in place (R.T., at 92-96).\n It is certainly true that parliamentary elections have been severely hampered over\nthe past 30 years by wars and political turmoil.  Despite ongoing civil conflict, Lebanon\nhas continued to operate under a constitutionally established central government since\nits institution of  power sharing in 1991.  While the U.S. does maintain diplomatic\nrelations with Lebanon, the country remains subject to close security review by the U.S.\nState Department. \nU.S. citizens who travel to the region are advised to exercise caution, particularly\nwhen traveling in parts of the southern suburbs of Beirut and portions of the Bekaa\nValley and south Lebanon (see Country Specific Information, Lebanon, supra; Travel\nWarning, Lebanon, supra). The State Department emphasizes that Hizballah (a\nLebanese Shi\u2019a group designated by the U.S. as a terrorist organization) has not been\ndisarmed and maintains a strong presence in these areas.  Palestinian groups hostile to\nboth the Lebanese government and U.S. citizens generally operate largely autonomously\nin Lebanese refugee camps throughout the country and pose heavy risks to both U.S.\ncitizens and Palestinian camps.\nEfforts to abolish the confessional system have dominated Lebanon politics for\ndecades.  Although moderated somewhat under the 1989 Ta\u2019if Agreement, the system\nremains essentially intact today (see Background Note: Lebanon, supra, at 8-9).  \nOfficial State Department reports confirm that Lebanon\u2019s economy is the 68th\nlargest export market for the U.S. (see Background Note: Lebanon, supra, at 8-9).  Major\ncompetitors of U.S. companies in Lebanon include French, British, Korean, and Chinese\ncompanies (id., at 11).  The U.S. has a Trade Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA)\nthat is designed to promote investment and expand trade with Lebanon in accordance\nwith UN Security Council Resolution 1701.   \nBetween 1975 and 2005, the U.S. channeled more than $400 million in aid to\nLebanon (see Background Note: Lebanon, supra, at 12).  The U.S. stepped up its\neconomic aid following the 2006 war.  And since reassessing its security aid to Lebanon\nin 1993 to bolster the LAF, the U.S. has expanded its military assistance to support the\nLebanese government\u2019s fulfillment of its obligations mandated by UN Resolution 1701.\nHuman rights, collection, and safety concerns in Lebanon\nDespite a democratically elected government and good relations with the U.S.,\nLebanon\u2019s overall human rights record has not been very good.  Its human rights record\nhas been marked by reported incidents of excessive force and torture against both\nLebanese citizens and foreigners by Lebanese security and intelligence personnel,\narbitrary arrest and detention of persons critical of the government policies, flawed\nelections, and Syrian influence.\n\n9\nEven Lebanon\u2019s new Code of Criminal Procedure (enacted in 2001) has not been\nable to curb lengthy pre-trial detention of persons critical of the Government\u2019s policies,\nstem continued surveillance of political activities that could pose a potential threat to the\nGovernment, or solve reports of politically motivated disappearances (see  Country\nReports on Human Rights Practices - 2007, Lebanon, supra, at 1-4)\nLebanon\u2019s overall human rights record continues to be poor: marked by reported\nincidents of excessive force and torture against both Lebanese citizens and foreigners by\nLebanese security and intelligence personnel.  Reported cases of arbitrary arrests and\ndetentions by Lebanese security forces, as well as instances of unlawful deprivations of\nlife, torture and other abuses have been numerous since the adoption of its constitution\n(see  Country Reports on Human Rights Practices - 2007, Lebanon, supra, at 1-4).\nWhile Lebanon law does not specifically prohibit torture in its Code of Criminal Procedure\nit does require judicial warrants before arrests, except for situations involving immediate\npursuit (id, at 3).  The absence of any legal authority has not stopped police and\ngovernment agents from arbitrarily arresting and detaining people (id., at 3-4).  Further,\nmilitias and non-Lebanese forces (NGOs) operating outside of Lebanon\u2019s central\ngovernment authority have shown no reluctance to violate privacy rights to obtain\nneeded data and information from perceived adversaries.  \nStill, despite all of the chronicled weaknesses in Lebanon\u2019s institutions, the\nLebanon government still functions as a democratic state under a constitution that\nretains a judicial system independent in principle, even if it is subject to political pressure\nand reported abuses in its insurance of fair trials and the protection of constitutionally\nprotected liberties like freedom of the press, religion and association\nAnd on a more positive note, Lebanon\u2019s human rights record has shown\nimprovement in recent years.  In the January 2009 Annual Report of the UN\u2019s Human\nrights Council, the High Commissioner writing for the Council noted the Lebanese\nGovernment\u2019s expressed commitment to expose and eliminate arbitrary detentions and\ntorture of arrested persons.  The Lebanese government is credited with highlighting the\nimportance of other human rights, such as access to adequate medical care in prisons\nand of respecting the rights of immigrants and foreigners residing in Lebanon.  \nCases of illegal exporting of technology have been reported.  One such case\ninvolved the attempted illegal export of U.S. restricted, dual use technology to Hizballah.\nIn August 2005, the involved individual pleaded guilty to attempting to illegally export\nmilitary night-vision equipment and infrared aiming devices to Hizballah (see Naji Antoine\nAbi Khalil Sentenced to 60 Months Imprisonment for Attempting to Export Military Night-\nVision Equipment to Hizballah, supra).  In November 2007, an individual pleaded guilty\nto attempting to provide night vision goggles, a thermal imaging device, and two global\npositioning modules to a person in Lebanon who was purchasing equipment for\nHizballah (see  Michigan Man Pleads Guilty to Supporting Hizballah, supra).  Whether\nthese cases represent the tip of a serious pattern of illegal exporting of dual use\ntechnology to Hizballah and other terrorist NGOs operating in Lebanon or isolated events\n\n10\nis not clear.  State Department records do not make the case for classifying Lebanon as\na serious source of Illegal acquisitions of dual use and other types of technology that can\nbe used for military purposes by NGOs operating in the country. \nFor Americans traveling abroad in Lebanon, passports and visas are required\n(see Travel Warning, Lebanon, supra, at 1).  Care is advised when traveling in parts of\nthe southern suburbs of Beirut, portions of the Bekaa Valley, and areas south of the\nLitani River in South Lebanon (id., at 2). The State Department emphasizes that\nHizballah (a Lebanese Shi\u2019a group designated by the U.S. as a terrorist organization)\nhas not been disarmed and maintains a strong presence in these areas (see Country\nSpecific Information, Lebanon, supra, at 2). \nPalestinian groups hostile to both the Lebanese Government and U.S. citizens\ngenerally operate largely autonomously in Lebanese refugee camps throughout the\ncountry and pose heavy risks to both US citizens and Palestinian camps (id. Still another\nterrorist group, Asbat al-Ansar (with reported links to Al-Qaida) is known to have targeted\nUS and Lebanese Government interests.  State Department records report that Hizballah\nmilitants blocked the road to Rafiq Hariri Int\u2019l Airport in May 2008, rendering the airport\ninaccessible to travelers (id.).  While airport access has since been restored, widespread\nhostilities have been curtailed, and the country has gained a new president and cabinet,\nconcerns over Hizballah sponsored  violence have not diminished (id., at 2).  \nAmericans have been targets of terrorist assaults in the past and promise to\nremain so in the future for so long as terrorist movements are unimpeded.  For the\nforeseeable future, terrorist groups, such as Hizballah, al Queda, and al Sham continue\nto be allowed to operate in the country with virtual impunity (see Country Specific\nInformation, Lebanon, supra, at 2).   Strengthening of LAF forces with the support of a\nbetter organized and financed central government offers the most promise for stabilizing\nthe country.\nCharacter assessments\nApplicant has received excellent endorsements from his company\u2019s management.\nHis supervisors describe him as a highly competent professional engineer who is logical\nand trustworthy in all of his work assignments (see ex. C).  He is commended by his\nformer management and Government customers for his recognized expertise and\nvaluable technical support to the U.S. delegation he worked with and his important\ncontributions to satellite communication technology (ex. C).  His colleagues past and\npresent credit him with strong character and integrity with a reputation for dedication and\nsincerity on and off the job (ex. C).\nPolicies\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to\nClassified Information (effective September 2006) list Guidelines to be considered by\n\n11\nadministrative judges in the decision making process covering DOHA cases.  These\nGuidelines require the administrative judge to consider all of the \"Conditions that could\nraise a security concern and may be disqualifying\u201d (Disqualifying Conditions), if any, and\nall of the \"Mitigating Conditions,\" if any, before deciding whether or not a security\nclearance should be granted, continued or denied.  The Guidelines do not require the\nadministrative judge to assess these factors exclusively in arriving at a decision.  In\naddition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, administrative judges must take into\naccount the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in\nE.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which are intended to\nassist the administrative judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication\npolicy factors are pertinent herein:\nForeign Preference\nThe Concern: When an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference\nfor a foreign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to provide\ninformation or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.  See\nAdjudicative Guideline (AG), \u00b6 9.\nForeign Influence\nThe Concern: Foreign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the\nindividual has divided  loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that is not\nin U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest.\nAdjudication under the this Guideline can and should considered the identity of the\nforeign country in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but\nnot limited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to target\nUnited States citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of\nterrorism.  See AG, \u00b6 6.\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the precepts framed by the Directive, a decision to grant or continue\nan Applicant's request for security clearance may be made only upon a threshold finding\nthat to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because the Directive\nrequires administrative judges to make a common sense appraisal of the evidence\naccumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and materiality of that\nevidence. As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge may draw only those inferences\nwhich have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the\nJudge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.\n\n12\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted\nfacts alleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts\nproven have a material bearing to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a\nsecurity clearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, does not require\nthe Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled\nor abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security clearance.\nRather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant may\ndeliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the burden of proof shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or\nmitigation of the Government's case.\nAnalysis\nApplicant is a naturalized U.S. citizen who immigrated from Lebanon in 1980 for\neducational reasons.  Security concerns focus on members of Applicant\u2019s family and his\nretention of his Lebanese passport (indicative of a foreign preference) and his past\nunwillingness to renounce hi Lebanese citizenship. \nSecurity concerns are raised, too, over members of Applicant\u2019s immediate family\n(i.e., his father, sisters and brothers) and in-laws who are citizens and residents of\nLebanon, a country  historically friendly to the U.S., albeit, one with a reported history of\npolitical instability fueled by the terrorist activities of Hizballah and other non-\ngovernmental terrorist organizations operating in Lebanon. \nForeign Preference\nThe exercise of active dual citizenship necessarily entails allegiance assessments\nand invites critical considerations over acts indicating a preference or not for the interests\nof the foreign country over the interests of the U.S.  The issues, as such, raise concerns\nover Applicant\u2019s  preference for a foreign country over the U.S.\nBy virtue of his birth in Lebanon to parents of Lebanese ancestry, Applicant\nacquired Lebanese citizenship and a Lebanese passport, which he continued to retain\neven after becoming a U.S. citizen in 1999 and after the Lebanese passport expired in\n2002.  Until this hearing, he consistently declined to relinquish his expired Lebanon\npassport or express any intention to renounce his Lebanese citizenship because these\nconnections to Lebanon are part of his heritage.  Since becoming a naturalized U.S.\ncitizen, Applicant has taken no actions (save for his retaining his expired Lebanese\npassport), and exercised no Lebanese privileges, that can be fairly characterized as\nactive indicia of dual citizenship.  In fairness to Applicant, he holds no assets in Lebanon\nthat pose recognizable conflicts of interest or otherwise manifest indica of Lebanon\npreference.  He has no foreign financial interests; he has never served in the LAR or\n\n13\nvoted in a Lebanese election, and has never sought to hold any political office in\nLebanon.  He retains no other Lebanon privileges, and has never performed or\nattempted to perform duties, or otherwise acted so as to serve the interests of Lebanon\nin preference to the interests of the U.S., since becoming a U.S. citizen.\nBecause Applicant continued to possess his Lebanon passport after becoming a\nnaturalized U.S. citizen, the Government may apply disqualifying condition (DC) \u00b6 10(a)\nof AG \u00b6 9, \u201cexercise of any right, privilege or obligations of foreign citizenship after\nbecoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family member.  This\nincludes but is not limited to:\n(1) possession of a current foreign passport;\n(2) military service or a willingness to bear arms for a foreign country; \n(3) accepting educational, medical, retirement, social welfare, or other such           \n           benefits from a foreign country; \n(4) residence in a foreign country to meet citizenship requirements; \n(5) using foreign citizenship to protect financial or business interests in another     \n           country;\n(6) seeking or holding political office in a foreign country; and\n(7) voting in a foreign election.\n In Applicant\u2019s favor, he offered to surrender his expired Lebanese passport and\nconsider renouncing his Lebanese citizenship.  He subsequently supplemented the\nrecord with documented surrender of his expired Lebanese passport to his FSO.  While\ntiming conditions did not permit him to effectively renounce his Lebanese citizenship, he\nexpressed a clear intention to do so in the supplemental materials he provided after the\nhearing. \nBy relinquishing his expired Lebanese passport, Applicant has complied with the\nmitigation requirements of MC \u00b6 11 (e), \u201cthe passport has been destroyed, surrendered\nto the cognizant security authority, or otherwise invalidated,\u201d of AG \u00b6 9. He satisfies the\nmitigation requirements of MC \u00b6 11 (b), \u201cthe individual has expressed a willingness to\nrenounce dual citizenship.\u201d Accordingly, each of these mitigating conditions has\napplication to Applicant\u2019s situation.\nWhole person precepts favor Applicant\u2019s preference for the U.S. over Lebanon.\nHe is a U.S. citizen by naturalization and has consistently demonstrated his loyalty for\nthe U.S.  All of his financial interests are situated in the U.S.  He is highly regarded by his\ncurrent supervisors and colleagues and past senior managers and government\n\n14\ncustomers for his important contributions to communication satellite technology. And he\nhas  impressed supervisors, colleagues, and Government customers alike who have\nworked with him over the years with sound judgment, reliability and trustworthiness in\nexecuting his project responsibilities.  Expressing his interest in renouncing his Lebanese\ncitizenship and relinquishing his Lebanese passport document demonstrates his\nundivided loyalty and preference for U.S. institutions and its way of life over those of his\nbirth country (Lebanon).  He has never served in the LAF, voted in a Lebanese election\nor held an elective or appointed position in Lebanon.  Moreover, all of his financial\ninterests are in the U.S.  He has no financial interests in Lebanon and has exercised no\nprivileges in Lebanon (save for possessing a expired Lebanese passport before he\nsurrendered it to  his FSO this year).\nOverall, Applicant persuades that his preference is for the U.S.  He satisfies his\nproof burden in several ways: demonstrated lack of any exercise of any privileges\nassociated with his Lebanese citizenship, save for his past possession of his expired\nLebanese passport after his naturalization as a U.S. citizen in 1999.  Applicant\u2019s actions\nabsolve himself of foreign preference concerns and enable him to carry his evidentiary\nburden on the presented issue of whether his preference lies with his adopted country\n(U.S.) or the country (Lebanon) where he was born and raised as a minor. Favorable\nconclusions warrant with respect to the allegations covered by subparagraphs 2.a\nthrough 2.c of Guideline C.\nForeign influence concerns\nBy virtue of the Lebanese citizenship and residency of Applicant\u2019s parents and\nsiblings in Lebanon, they present potential heightened security risks covered by\ndisqualifying condition  (DC) 7(a), \u201ccontact with a foreign family member, business or\nprofessional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign\ncountry if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement,\nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion,\u201d of the Adjudication Guidelines for foreign influence.\nThe citizenship/residence status of these family members in Lebanon pose potential\nconcerns for Applicant because of the risks of undue foreign influence that could\ncompromise sensitive or classified information under Applicant's possession and/or\ncontrol. \nNone of Applicant\u2019s family members residing in Lebanon have any identified prior\nLebanese military or intelligence service.  Applicant maintains monthly contact with his\nfamily members and has made visits to Lebanon to see his parents (last visiting in 2007\nto attend his mother\u2019s funeral) and siblings.  He provided some financial support in the\npast to his mother before her death in 2006.   On the strength of these connections\nalone, they present some concerns over the potential for compromise and coercion for\nso long as they reside in Lebanon.  Were any  of these immediate family members to be\nplaced in a hostage situation, Applicant could be subject to conflicts over ensuring their\nwell being and protecting classified information.  For this reason, DC 7(b), \u201cconnection to\na foreign person, group, government, or country that create a potential conflict of interest\n\n15\nbetween the individual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the\nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that\ninformation,\u201d has some application to the facts of this case. \nTo be sure,  none of Applicant\u2019s immediate family members residing in Lebanon\nhave any history to date of being subjected to any coercion or influence.  These historical\nantecedents, when considered together with Applicant\u2019s limited personal contact with\nthese immediate family members (with some personal visits in the past and monthly\ntelephone interchanges), do limit the severity of a compromise risk under the facts of his\nsituation.  However, the absence of any past coercive measures taken by Lebanese\nauthorities does not completely absolve Applicant from coercive risks in the future.\nLebanon does have some history of human rights abuses and has for the most part over\nthe past 30 years operated with a relatively weak central government and strong foreign\nadversaries (both state and NGOs) operating throughout the country. As a result,\nLebanon must be considered for heightened risk status under the foreign influence\nguideline. \nStill, before the presence of Applicant\u2019s immediate family members in Lebanon\ncan be negated or excluded as manageable risks, the state of Lebanon\u2019s laws and\ninstitutions governing internal security, human rights, and intelligence gathering matters,\nmust he assessed when considering whether the continuing citizenship and residency of\nApplicant\u2019s immediate family members in Lebanon make the risks of duress or\ncompromise to his family unmanageable ones from the standpoint of protecting U.S.\nclassified information.\nTaking Applicant\u2019s explanations about his parents and siblings at face value, any\nrisk of pressure or undue foreign influence on Applicant and/or his immediate family\nwould appear to be insubstantial and clearly manageable.  Lebanon, despite its history of\nunstable political and security conditions (marked by the presence of Syrian troops and\nterrorist organizations operating within its borders) and a checkered human rights record,\nis not a country considered hostile to U.S. interests by the U.S. State Department.\nMoreover, nothing in the backgrounds of Applicant\u2019s father, brothers and sisters, or their\nspouses, have changed over the past 30 years to warrant the attribution of increased\nsecurity risks to their current status in Lebanon.\nThe Adjudicative Guidelines governing security clearances do not dictate per se\nresults or mandate particular outcomes for any chosen set of guidelines covering risks of\nforeign influence.  What is considered to be an acceptable risk in one foreign country\nmay not be in another.  While foreign influence cases must by practical necessity be\nweighed on a case-by-case basis, guidelines are available for referencing.  Personnel\nsecurity assessments necessarily embrace similar risk assessments under the new\nDirective guidelines for assessing foreign influence risks and concerns associated with\nthe individual's having family abroad, which include both common sense assessments of\ncountry risks and information available from public sources. \n\n16\nUnlike the old Adjudicative Guidelines, though, the new ones do take into account\nthe country\u2019s demonstrated relations with the U.S. as an important consideration in\ngauging whether the particular relatives with citizenship and residency elsewhere create\na heightened security risk. The geopolitical aims and policies of the particular foreign\nregime involved do matter. \nBased on Applicant\u2019s case-specific circumstances, MC 8(a), \u201cthe nature of the\nrelationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are located, or the\npersons or activities of these persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the\nindividual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of a\nforeign a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the\nU.S.\u201d  is available to Applicant.   Because of the presence of Applicant\u2019s immediate and\nextended family members in Lebanon has not been, and does not expect to be exploited\nby the Lebanon Government to facilitate the compromise of classified information\navailable to Applicant, any potential risk of a hostage situation or undue foreign influence\nbrought in the hopes of eliciting classified information out of Applicant (either directly or\nindirectly) becomes an acceptable one, and a risk at least partially compatible with the\nmitigation benefits covered by MC 8(a).  \n In the same vein, MC 8(b), \u201cthere is no conflict of interest, either because the\nindividual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or\ncountry is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships\nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of\ninterest in favor of the U.S. interest,\u201d is also fully available to Applicant. Applicant\u2019s\ndemonstrated loyalty and commitment to the U.S. and its institutions and values, the\nabsence of any history of coercive measures taken against any of Applicant\u2019s family\nmembers in Lebanon, and Applicant\u2019s more limited personal contacts and ties with his\nfamily members since his mother\u2019s death, are well supported in this administrative\nrecord.\nApplicant\u2019s demonstrated loyalty, patriotism, and professional commitments to\nthe U.S., are credible and substantial.  Considered together with the absence of any\nhistorical attempts to pressure or coerce any of Applicant\u2019s family members in Lebanon,\nApplicant\u2019s case-specific circumstances are enough to neutralize all potential conflicts\nthat are implicit in his relationships with his father, siblings and their spouses. \nOne other mitigating condition has mixed application to Applicant\u2019s situation.  MC\n8(e), \u201cthe individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements regarding\nthe reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, groups, or organizations\nfrom a foreign country,\u201d has some prospective value based on Applicant\u2019s long tenure of\nholding security clearances and working in highly technical and protected fields, and his\ndemonstrated loyalty and commitments to U.S. security interests.  It is true that our\nAppeal Board has accorded very little weight to stated intentions to take corrective steps\nin a hypothetical set of circumstances, absent record evidence that an applicant has\nacted similarly under comparable circumstances.  See ISCR Case No. 07-00029, at 4\n\n17\n(App. Bd. Dec. 7, 2007); ISCR Case No. 06-24575, at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 9, 2007).\nApplicant\u2019s long and meritorious contractor service and demonstrated loyalties to U.S.\ncore security interests and values make him a very credible applicant for reporting any\npotential compromise attempts on any of his relatives residing in Lebanon.  \nFully considering Applicant\u2019s demonstrated devotion to U.S. interests and values\nand the lack of any reported associations between his father and siblings and the\nLebanon government and foreign forces operating in Lebanon, any residual risks of\nundue foreign influence on Applicant and/or his family members residing in Lebanon in\nthe foreseeable future are manageable ones. \nConflation of all of the circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s devoted federal\ncontractor service and commitments to U.S. security interests and core values,\nLebanon\u2019s country status, Applicant\u2019s more limited personal contacts with his father,\nsiblings and their spouses residing in Lebanon, and the absence of any prior attempts by\nthe Lebanese government or foreign agents and NGOs operating in Lebanon to\npressure, exploit or coerce any of Applicant\u2019s relatives residing in Lebanon augur well for\nApplicant in making the necessary predictive judgments about whether risks of pressure\nan coercion are mitigated.  \nWhole person assessment permits mitigation of Applicant\u2019s exposure to potential\npainful choices over ensuring the safety and well being of his father and siblings\ncurrently residing in Iran.  To his credit, Applicant is a fully Americanized U.S. citizen with\ndemonstrated strong loyalties and commitments to U.S. core values.  The trust he has\ninspired with his supervisors, colleagues and Government customers, promises to\nensure that he would report any Lebanese pressures or contacts to his facility security\nofficer and not permit himself to be pressured by Lebanese authorities in any\nhypothetical hostage situation. \nAfter carefully considering Applicant\u2019s familial connections in the U.S. and\nLebanon and the risks of Applicant submission to Lebanese pressures should any of his\nfamily members residing in Lebanon be pressured or coerced by Lebanese authorities,\nand or foreign agents and NGOs) at some time in the foreseeable future, the weighted\nrisks of a compromise are sufficiently discounted to become manageable ones at this\ntime under a whole person assessment of all of the critical circumstances considered in\nthis case.\nOverall, any potential security concerns attributable to Applicant's relations with\nhis father, siblings and their residing in Lebanon are sufficiently mitigated to permit safe\npredictive judgments about Applicant's ability to withstand risks of undue influence\nattributable to his familial relationships with relatives residing in Lebanon.  Favorable\nconclusions warrant with respect to the allegations covered by sub-paragraphs 2.a\nthrough 2.d of Guideline B. \n\n18\nIn reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including\neach of the factors and conditions enumerated in E 2(a) of the Adjudicative Process of\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive.\nFormal Findings\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR in the context of the findings of fact,\nconclusions, and the factors and conditions listed above, I make the following separate\nformal findings with respect to Applicant's eligibility for a security clearance.\nGUIDELINE C (FOREIGN PREFERENCE):\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-paras. 1.a through 1.c:\nFor   Applicant\nGUIDELINE B (FOREIGN INFLUENCE):\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-paras. 2.a through 2.d:\nFor   Applicant\nConclusions\n In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant's security clearance. \nClearance is granted.\n                                  \nRoger C.

Applicant submitted a copy of a payment in the amount\n\n4\nof $621.50, dated July 9,2008, to this creditor. I find that Applicant has resolved this\ndebt. \n1.m. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $955.  In Item 11,\nApplicant represented that this debt had been settled in full.  Letter 12 in Item 11 shows\nthat Applicant had made an arrangement with this creditor to make one payment of\n$621.50 to settle this debt in full. Applicant submitted a copy of a payment in the amount\nof $621.50, dated August 4, 2008, to this creditor. I find that Applicant has resolved this\ndebt. \n1.n. It is alleged in the SOR that Applicant had a real estate mortgage that was\nforeclosed and the collateral sold on or about April 2003. In Item 11, Applicant\nrepresented that this debt had been assigned to her husband in their divorce decree.  \n1.o. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $5,776.  In Item 11,\nApplicant represented that she has been protesting this balance with the creditor.  Letter\n8 in Item 11 includes a letter from Applicant to the creditor in which she avers that this\naccount was inadvertently charged to her rather than to her husband, and it has now\nbeen transferred so the balance under her name should show $0. In her letter, she\nfurther stated that she has disputed this bill with all three credit reporting agencies. A\nsubsequent letter from the creditor also states that Applicant does not have an account\nwith this creditor. I find that Applicant has made a good faith attempt to resolve this\ndebt. \n1.p. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $169.  In Item 11,\nApplicant represented that this debt had been paid in full.  Letter 9 in Item 11 shows that\nApplicant has a balance of $0 to this creditor. I find that Applicant has resolved this\ndebt. \n1.q. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $18,951.   In Item 11,\nApplicant represented that she has been protesting this balance with the creditor.  Letter\n10 in Item 11 includes a letter from Applicant to the creditor in which she states that a\nvehicle that she had allowed to be voluntarily repossessed in April 2002. Was ultimately\nsold at auction for $19,530, more than $18,951, which was the amount that had been\nowed on the vehicle at that time.  A subsequent letter from the creditor states that\nApplicant has a balance of $0 with this creditor. I find that Applicant has resolved this\ndebt. \n1.r. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $488.   In Item 11,\nApplicant represented that this debt is the same as the debt listed as 1.c., above.  Letter\n15 in Item 11 shows that this is the same debt as 1.c., and as reviewed above, I find\nthat Applicant has resolved this debt. \n1.s. It is alleged in the SOR that Applicant had a net monthly remainder of $4,408\nas of April 2008.  In Item 11, Applicant points out that this remainder occurred fairly\nrecently, as of the time she received a promotion that increased her income and her\n\n5\nmonthly payments on her mortgage decreased. She also states that she has always\naccepted her debts and was looking for the best method to resolve them.   \nI find that Applicant has done an outstanding job in contacting her creditors and\nresolving all of her debts. I also want to commend Applicant for her thorough and\nefficient written presentation of the steps she took to resolve each debt. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information. \n\n6\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations\nis set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect \n[sensitive] \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns.\nUnder AG \u00b6 19 (a), an Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts is potentially\ndisqualifying. Similarly under AG \u00b6  19 (c), a history of not meeting financial obligations\nmay raise security concerns. Applicant accumulated significant delinquent debt and was\nunable to pay some obligations for a period of time. The evidence is sufficient to raise\nthese potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate\ntrustworthiness concerns arising from financial difficulties.\nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns: Mitigating\nCondition (d) is applicable and controlling since Applicant has made a good faith effort\nto resolve and repay her overdue debts, and due to her excellent efforts, it appears that\nthey have all now been resolved. \n I conclude that Applicant has mitigated the financial concerns and is more\nfinancially sound and better prepared for future contingencies.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate\nan Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the\nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should\nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature,\nextent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct,\nto include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;\n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\n\n7\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2 (c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.      \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Based on the reasons cited above\nas to why Mitigating Condition (d) applies, together with a review of the thoroughness of\nApplicant\u2019s presentation and resolution, I find that the record evidence leaves me with\nno significant questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security\nclearance under the whole person concept. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant\nhas mitigated the security concerns. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a. - 1.s.:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                              \nMartin H. Mogul\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Security clearance is\ndenied.\nApplicant completed a security clearance application (SF-86) dated October 19,\n2007. On October 31, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) enumerating security concerns arising under\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations). The action was taken under Executive Order\n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as\namended, Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and\nthe revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December\n29, 2005, and effective for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nIn a response dated January 13, 2009, Applicant admitted 18 of the 19\nallegations noted in the SOR and requested a hearing. The matter was referred to\nJuly 27, 2009\n\n Tr. 67-68.\n      1\n Tr. 21.\n      2\n Tr. 25.\n      3\n Tr. 25-27.\n      4\n Tr. 27-28.\n      5\n2\nDOHA on March 4, 2009, and the case was assigned to me that day. Department\nCounsel and Applicant agreed to a hearing date of April 30, 2009. A notice of hearing\nwas issued to that effect on April 1, 2009. I was unable to timely convene the hearing\nas scheduled and the hearing was rescheduled for May 7, 2009, without objection. I\nconvened the hearing as scheduled. Applicant was represented by counsel. Applicant\ngave testimony and offered one document which was admitted without objection as\nexhibit (Ex.) A. Department Counsel offered seven documents admitted as Exs. 1-7\nwithout objection. Applicant was given through May 18, 2009, to supplement the record\nwith any additional materials and to substitute a copy for the original document offered\nas Ex. A. On May 18, 2009, I closed the record. On May 19, 2009, Applicant\u2019s attorney\nsent Department Counsel a facsimile transmission copy of what was previously marked\nas Ex. A. On June 22, 2009, Department Counsel forwarded that document to me,\nnoting he had no objection to it being admitted into the record. On that same day, I\nreopened the record, admitted the document, and then again closed the record. In the\ninterim, the transcript (Tr.) of the proceeding was received on May 21, 2009.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 30-year-old supervisory electronics technician working for a\ndefense contractor. He has worked for the same employer for a little over two years.\nApplicant has approximately eight years of military service and has attended some\ncollege. Currently separated from his wife, Applicant has custody of their two minor\nchildren. He also has a third minor child for whom he pays regular child support.\nApplicant has not received financial counseling.\nIn 1996, Applicant joined the military following completion of high school. He\nenjoyed solid credit and lived within his means for several years thereafter. He married\nin December 1998 and he received a military discharge in June 2004.  Soon thereafter,\n1\nhe fell into a \u201crut\u201d and failed to keep himself \u201cneat and tidy.\u201d  Meanwhile, he and his wife\n2\nexperienced marital problems that began as he served overseas while his wife\nremained in the United States and oversaw their finances.  Unbeknownst to Applicant,\n3\nhis wife did not pay some of their bills, causing them to become delinquent.  She\n4\ncontinued to conceal her non-payment of the bills even after the couple separated in\nJuly 2005.  Shortly thereafter, Applicant moved in with his mother. He then moved in\n5\nwith his father in 2006 with plans to work for one of his father\u2019s colleagues. Applicant\n\n Tr. 30.\n      6\n Tr. 76.\n      7\n Tr. 32.\n      8\n Tr. 36.\n      9\n Ex. A (Satisfaction of Judgment); Tr. 37-46. Although caught up on his arrearage, Applicant is still under\n      10\na court order to provide child support for the two children who have since come to reside with him. Given this\nchange in circumstances, he is now trying to petition the court to end such payments for these two children.\nTr. 48. He is also liable for child support for his third child, the existence of whom he first discovered in\nFebruary 2008. Child support and a retroactive arrearage is being paid through garnishment or wage\nwithholding. Tr. 76-78.\n Answer to the SOR, dated January 13, 2009.\n      11\n Tr. 87.\n      12\n3\nfailed to leave forwarding addresses when he moved. Consequently, he received no\ncorrespondence from creditors reflecting balances owed.  \n6\nIn the interim, Applicant faced a period of unemployment from November 2006\nthrough April 2007 after his father\u2019s colleague lost his business. In July 2007, following\nhis divorce, Applicant won custody of his two children from his now ex-wife.  \n7\nApplicant remained unaware that he had any delinquent debts until after he\nsubmitted his security clearance application in late 2007. He first became aware of\nthese debts at some point between his application date and his receipt of the SOR in\n2008. Had he learned of his debt earlier, he would not have had the financial resources\nto pay these debts and still meet his regular expenses and child support obligations.8\nSince learning of their existence, he has contemplated various methods of addressing\nhis debt. Before the hearing, Applicant consulted with a bankruptcy attorney. Applicant\nand the bankruptcy attorney are presently preparing a Chapter 7 bankruptcy filing. That\nattorney advised him to make no payments on his debts until the filing has been made\nso as not to demonstrate an illegal preference for individual creditors.  The SOR\n9\nenumerates 19 delinquent accounts, amounting to about $30,000 in debt. The only debt\nhe has addressed is the child support obligation for approximately $786 noted in\nallegation \u00b6 1.r.  He also disputes the $3 obligation noted in allegation \u00b6 1.l, which he\n10\nclaims, without evidence, is no longer reflected on his credit report.11\nCurrently, Applicant earns an approximate net salary of $1,000 a month after\nwithholding and child support payments. He and his children live simply. Applicant pays\na nominal rent of $250 a month to a couple with whom he and his two children live. This\nrent includes utilities. Applicant has no car payment, but pays about $86 a month for car\ninsurance and about $200 a month for gasoline. About $120 a month is spent on after-\nschool programs for the children. Groceries cost about $100 a month while about $50 a\nmonth is spent on clothing. Applicant no longer has any credit cards. He has no loans\nor debts other than those noted in the SOR.  Applicant does not maintain a savings\n12\n\n Tr. 88.\n      13\n See also ISCR Case No. 94-1075 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, 1995).\n      14\n Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\n      15\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 at 7-8 (App. Bd. Jan. 27, 1995).\n      16\n4\naccount. At the end of the month, Applicant has about $50 left after payment of all\ncurrent obligations.  At work, Applicant is a valued employee. His employer is willing to\n13\nwork with him as he resolves his financial issues. He recently received a significant\npromotion and raise in salary that should help his future finances. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions. These guidelines are not\ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these\nguidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process.\nThe administrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and\ncommon-sense decision. Under AG \u00b6 2(c), this process is a conscientious scrutiny of a\nnumber of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge\nmust consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present,\nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nThe government must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in\nthe SOR. An applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to\nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by\nDepartment Counsel. . . .\u201d  The burden of proof is something less than a\n14\npreponderance of evidence.  The ultimate burden of persuasion is on the applicant.  \n15\n16\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\ngovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration\nof the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\n\n Id.\n      17\n Id.\n      18\n Executive Order 10865 \u00a7 7.\n      19\n Revised Adjudicative Guideline (AG) \u00b6 18.\n      20\n5\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \u201cThe clearly consistent standard\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access\n17\nto sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such sensitive\ninformation.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily\n18\na determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the\n19\napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense\nhave established for issuing a clearance.\nBased upon consideration of the evidence, I find Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations) to be the most pertinent to the case. Conditions pertaining to this\nadjudicative guideline that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as\nwell as those which would mitigate such concerns, are set forth and discussed below.\nAnalysis\nGuideline F \u2013 Financial Considerations\nUnder Guideline F, failure or an inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or an\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.20\nThe Directive sets out several potentially disqualifying conditions under this guideline. \nApplicant acquired a number of delinquent debts when his wife mismanaged his\nfinances. To date, those debts continue to remain largely unaddressed. Financial\nConsiderations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability or unwillingness\nto satisfy debts\u201d) and FC DC AG \u00b6 9(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d)\napply. With such conditions raised, the burden shifts to Applicant to overcome the case\nagainst him and mitigate security concerns. \nApplicant\u2019s ex-wife purposefully or negligently mismanaged Applicant\u2019s finances.\nNothing prevented him, however, from casually inquiring about his finances when they\n\n6\nwere together, personally assessing his financial status when he resumed control of his\nfinances after their separation, or having his mail forwarded when he moved so he\ncould receive account and business correspondence. Such actions could have\ndemonstrated responsible behavior despite Applicant\u2019s ex-wife\u2019s mismanagement.\nFinancial Considerations Mitigating Condition (FC MC) AG \u00b6 20(b) (\u201cthe conditions that\nresulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce\nor separation) and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances\u201d) does not\napply. \nThe acquisition of Applicant\u2019s debt occurred while his ex-wife managed\nApplicant\u2019s finances and he expressed no interest in their status. He was later\nneglectful of his accounts after his separation. To date, only a delinquent balance of\napproximately $800 has been paid from a list of 19 delinquent accounts representing\nabout $30,000 in delinquent debt. The rest of the delinquent accounts remain\nunaddressed. Today, he is attempting to resolve his debts through bankruptcy, but has,\nthus far, not received financial counseling that might give some assurance he has the\ntools to manage his finances in the future. Given these facts, neither FC MC AG \u00b6 20(a)\n(\u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\u201d) nor FC MC \u00b6 20(d) (\u201cthe individual\ninitiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts\u201d)\napplies. With regard to the planned Chapter 7 bankruptcy action, he has yet to submit a\npetition to the bankruptcy court. Taken in conjunction with his failure to receive financial\ncounseling or otherwise address his remaining debts, FC MC \u00b6 20(c) (\u201cthe person has\nreceived or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications\nthat the problem is being resolved or is under control\u201d) does not apply. No other\nmitigating conditions apply.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2)\nthe circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency\nof the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the\ntime of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is\nvoluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and\nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for\nthe conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation\nor recurrence. \n\n7\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security\nclearance must be an overall common-sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, as well as the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nfactors. Speaking in Applicant\u2019s favor is his highly credible testimony and his devotion to\nhis children. He responsibly took custody of two of his children and has been financially\nresponsible toward a child he only recently discovered was his. At work, he is a valued\nemployee who has earned his employer\u2019s trust. Moreover, his testimony makes it clear\nthat is was not an unwillingness, but an inability, to honor his debts that precluded him\nfrom previously addressing them. \nSpeaking against Applicant, however, is the complete and unfettered reliance he\nplaced on his former wife to properly manage his accounts and his failure to monitor her\nefforts in any manner. Applicant was equally neglectful in failing to seize control of his\nfinances, review their status, and leave forwarding addresses for his creditors, both\nwhen he became estranged from his ex-wife and thereafter. As a result of this neglect\nand his lack of sufficient funds, Applicant has only addressed a $786 debt. Moreover,\naside from payment of that one obligation, Applicant\u2019s only significant action toward\nresolving his debts occurred shortly before the hearing, when he retained a bankruptcy\nattorney for a proposed bankruptcy. A successful bankruptcy discharge may\ndemonstrate a legally valid method for resolving one\u2019s debts. By itself, however,\ntestimony that a bankruptcy petition is being prepared does not mitigate financial\nsecurity concerns. \nAs noted previously, any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be\nallowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such\nsensitive information. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not\nnecessarily a determination as to the loyalty of an applicant, but merely an indication\nthat the applicant has not met the strict guidelines established for issuing a clearance.\nHere, Applicant has demonstrated a present inability to pay his debts, scant effort to\nmanage his delinquent debts, and little concrete progress toward their resolution. With\nsecurity concerns regarding his finances unmitigated, I conclude it is not clearly\nconsistent with national security to grant Applicant a security clearance. Clearance is\ndenied. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n8\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.n\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.o:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.p\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.q:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.r:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.s:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant a security clearance.\nClearance is denied.\nARTHUR E.

Clearance is granted.\nOn October 9, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\na Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline\nB, foreign influence. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant answered the SOR on November 12, 2009, and requested a hearing.\nThe case was assigned to me on March 5, 2009. On March 16, 2009, a Notice of\nHearing was issued scheduling the case for April 8, 2009. It was held as scheduled. At\nthe hearing, I received two government exhibits, ten Applicant exhibits, and Applicant\u2019s\ntestimony. Also, at the government\u2019s request, I took administrative notice of the facts set\nJune 4, 2009\n\n2\nforth in seven exhibits, marked I through VII, regarding the Republic of Georgia. DOHA\nreceived the transcript on April 15, 2009.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 58-year-old married man with three children. The oldest are adults,\nand the youngest is 11 years old. Two previous marriages ended in divorce.\nFrom 1969 to 1972, Applicant served in the U.S. Army. He graduated from the\nSpecial Forces Officer Course at age 20 (Exhibit F). In February 1972, he was awarded\nthe Army Commendation Medal (Exhibit G). \nAfter leaving the military, Applicant attended college, earning a bachelor of arts\ndegree in Russian in 1975. He speaks fluent Russian, Spanish, French, and Polish. \nApplicant joined the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in 1980, serving until 1993.\nAs an \u201cofficial cover officer,\u201d he collected intelligence and recruited spies (Tr 43; Exhibit\n2 at 7). Some of these spies were themselves foreign intelligence officers. He spent\napproximately two years in the 1980s stationed in the former Soviet Union, a \u201chostile\nthreat environment,\u201d (Exhibit 2 at 14, 39) and served as a station chief in another region.\nThe intelligence he collected focused on adversaries\u2019 research and development.\nDuring this time, he held a security clearance (Tr. 66).\nIn 1983, the CIA awarded Applicant the Certificate of Exceptional\nAccomplishment for his work in the former Soviet Union (Tr. 26). This award is typically\ngiven posthumously (Id.). In 1985, the CIA selected Applicant as an \u201cExceptional\nIntelligence Collector\u201d (Exhibit B). \nAfter leaving the CIA, Applicant worked in a variety of consulting jobs. Also, he\npursued entrepreneurial endeavors that focused on economic development in the\nformer Soviet Union (Exhibit 2 at 5).\nFrom June 2003 through August 2003, Applicant worked as a consultant for a\nU.S. company (Item 2 at 12). During this time, he lived in Georgia (Tr. 47). Along with\ntwo retired U.S. lieutenant colonels who were also consultants for the company, he\ntaught U.S. Army progression techniques to the Georgian army (Tr. 46). From January\n2004 to May 2004, Applicant worked for a company tasked with assisting the Republic\nof Georgia\u2019s Ministry of Defense transition to a \u201cmore NATO style\u201d of doing business,\nand helping the country advance to a market economy (Item 2 at 12).\nSince 2007, Applicant has worked for a company that supplies special needs\nequipment to support special operations within the U.S. armed forces (Tr. 62). The\nproducts they market include robotics, tactical communications, and counter-improvised\nexplosive device technology (Tr. 63). The company also markets its products to foreign\ncountries. Applicant is its director of international sales (Tr. 69). Applicant\u2019s company\nhas to obtain export licenses for any of its products it markets overseas (Tr. 64). \n\n3\nThe Republic of Georgia is seeking to purchase some of the company\u2019s products\nwith funding provided by the U.S. European Command (EUCOM - Tr. 65). The\nGeorgian military intends to supply the technology to its special forces that are about to\ndeploy to Afghanistan in support of the NATO coalition (Id.).\nApplicant met his current wife in August 2003 while living in Georgia. At the time,\nshe was working for the Georgian Ministry of Defense as an information technology\nspecialist (Tr. 45). Applicant and his wife married in June 2005 (Exhibit 1 at 25). She\nobtained her permanent resident alien status in February 2006, and currently lives in the\nU.S. with Applicant. She intends to apply for U.S. citizenship as soon as she is eligible\n(Exhibit 2 at 8). Currently, she works as the manager of a cell phone company (Item 2 at\n18). Since getting married, Applicant and his wife have visited Georgia in July 2007 and\nSeptember 2008.\nApplicant\u2019s parents-in-law are Georgian citizens and residents. His father-in-law\nis a mechanical engineer who works at an Italian-owned company that makes wine and\nfruit juice (Tr. 47). Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law is a homemaker who provides daycare for\nher two grandchildren. She previously taught English in the Georgian educational\nsystem (Tr. 47, 57). Applicant\u2019s wife talks to them about once per week. Although\nApplicant and his parents-in-law are friendly, he talks with them only if he coincidentally\nhappens to be present when his wife calls them (Tr. 47, 57). Such conversations\naverage about once per month.\nApplicant\u2019s sister-in-law is a Georgian citizen and resident. She has a medical\ndegree in addition to a master\u2019s degree in business administration (Tr. 48). Currently,\nshe works at a Georgian bank (Tr. 48). Applicant talks with her approximately one to\nthree times per year.\nApplicant\u2019s wife\u2019s uncle is a high-ranking Georgian official who directs a quasi-\ngovernmental agency that ensures the security of the prime minister\u2019s communications\nchannels (Tr. 50). As part of his duties, he travels with the prime minister on trips\nabroad (Id.). Under the Soviet regime, as part of his mandatory military assignment, he\nwas assigned to a KGB unit (Tr. 49). During Georgia\u2019s first independent administration,\nhe worked in the defense ministry, specializing in signals intelligence (Tr. 61).\nApplicant talks to his wife\u2019s uncle approximately once every two to three months\n(Tr. 52, 60). He has encouraged the uncle to visit the next time he travels to the U.S.\n(Tr. 82).\nApplicant\u2019s brother-in-law is a citizen and resident of Georgia. He is an\ninformation technology professional who works part-time for his uncle, the high-ranking\nGeorgian official. Applicant talks to his brother-in-law one to three times per year.\nApplicant spent time with all of his wife\u2019s family during his two trips to Georgia.\nThe Republic of Geogia is a constitutional republic with a developing economy\n(Exhibit I at 1). The prime minister received his graduate education in the U.S. (Exhibit V\n\nThis program offers grant assistance to countries that meet certain requirements for good government\n1\nand commitment to reform.\n4\nat 5). Presidential, parliamentary, and municipal elections are largely free and fair\n(Exhibit II at 4). The government is sincerely committed to reducing corruption (Id.).\nConstitutional amendments ratified in 2006 increased the judiciary\u2019s independence (Id.).\nIn 2007, legislation was passed banning litigants from communicating with judges during\npre-trial and trial (Id.).\nGeorgia\u2019s constitution protects religious freedom, freedom of assembly, and\nfreedom of the press (Exhibit 4 at 22). The government neither restricts the Internet, nor\nlimits academic freedom or cultural events (Id. at 20). \nThe World Bank has recognized Georgia as the world\u2019s fastest-reforming\neconomy. Georgia was one of the first countries to receive a compact, in the amount of\n$295 million, from the U.S. Millennium Challenge Corporation (Exhibit II at 7).  \n1\nThe U.S./Georgia relationship is close (Id. at 7). A new highway leading from the\ncapital is named after President George W. Bush, and contains his mosaic at the\nentrance (Answer). \nGeorgia was one of the earliest and staunchest supporters of the U.S.-led\nOperation Iraqi Freedom (Exhibit IV at 3). In this conflict, Georgian troops have served\nunder U.S. command (Id.). \nThe mutual support of the U.S. and Georgian militaries predates Operation Iraqi\nFreedom. In 2002, the U.S. initiated the Georgia Train and Equip Program (GTEP).\nThrough this program, the U.S. trained 200 Georgian officers, in addition to 2000\nGeorgian soldiers and border guards. The training goals were, among other things, to\nresist Russian pressure and combat terrorism (Id.). The U.S. continues to provide\nmilitary professionalism training and advisory assistance to the Georgian military\n(Exhibit II at 7). Georgia has hosted the North Atlantic Treaty Organization\u2019s Partnership\nfor Peace military exercises annually since 2001 (Exhibit IV at 3).\nGeorgia is one of the most unstable parts of the former Soviet Union in terms of\nthe number, intensity, and length of ethnic conflict (Exhibit VIII at 2). In August 2008,\nongoing conflict between Georgia and one of its separatist regions escalated into a full-\nscale military conflict with Russia, a supporter of the separatists (Exhibit V at 11). On\nAugust 15, 2008, the countries agreed to a cease-fire. Under the cease-fire, Russia\nretained control of previously undisputed Georgian territory (Id.). Since the 2008\nRussian incursion, the U.S. pledged one billion dollars in foreign assistance including\n$150 million in loans and guarantees for construction, manufacturing, and affordable\nmortgages (Exhibit IV at 2).\n\n5\nCrime remains a serious problem in Georgia (Exhibit III at 1). Georgia\u2019s\ncommitment to human rights suffered a setback after the 2008 Russian incursion\n(Exhibit IV at 1). Since then, many areas have worsened including the use of excessive\nforce by law enforcement officers, torture and mistreatment of detainees, and\nrestrictions on freedom of speech, press, assembly, and political participation (Id.).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\nAnalysis\nGuideline B, Foreign Influence\nAG \u00b6 6 explains the foreign influence security concern as follows:\nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a\nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by\nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or\n\n6\nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such\nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a\nrisk of terrorism.\nApplicant\u2019s wife is a Georgian citizen living with him in the U.S., and his in-laws\nare citizens and residents of the Republic of Georgia. Although it is a friendly country, it\nwas once part of the Soviet Union, and as such, is still periodically subjected to Russian\naggression and intimidation. Moreover, Applicant\u2019s relationship with his uncle, a high-\nranking Georgian official, creates a security concern notwithstanding Georgia\u2019s good\nrelationship with the U.S. AG \u00b6 7(a), \u201ccontact with a foreign family member, business or\nprofessional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign\ncountry if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement,\nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion,\u201d and AG \u00b6 7(b), \u201cconnections to a foreign person,\ngroup, government, or country that create a potential conflict of interest between the\nindividual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s\ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing the information,\u201d apply.\nAlthough Georgia is not a paragon of democracy, it is certainly not a hostile,\ntotalitarian state seeking to project its power worldwide through the brute intimidation or\ncoercion of its citizens abroad. Consequently, Applicant\u2019s relationship with his wife does\nnot generate AG \u00b6 7(d), \u201csharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of\ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement,\nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion.\u201d\nApplicant only talks with his brother-in-law and sister-in-law, at most, three times\nper year. AG \u00b6 8(c), \u201ccontact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and\ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or\nexploitation,\u201d applies to these relationships.\nThere is a presumption that one\u2019s relationship with parent in-laws is not casual.\nNevertheless, Applicant\u2019s father-in-law\u2019s innocuous career, together with his mother-in-\nlaw\u2019s homemaker status, and Georgia\u2019s warm relationships with the U.S. are sufficient\nenough to trigger the application of AG \u00b6 8(a), \u201cthe nature of the relationships with\nforeign persons, the country in which these persons are located, or the positions or\nactivities of those persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be\nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual,\ngroup, organization, or government, and the interests of the U.S.\u201d applies.\nConversely, the security concern generated by Applicant\u2019s uncle\u2019s expertise in\nsignals intelligence and his current position as the director of the prime minister\u2019s\nnetwork security is significant. However, when balanced against Applicant\u2019s experience\nas a special forces officer, and a CIA officer who served with distinction for 13 years, I\nconclude that AG \u00b6 8(b), \u201c . . the individual has such deep and longstanding\nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any\nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest,\u201d applies.\n\n7\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n\u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nThe risk of inducement and potential for conflict of interest that Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s\nuncle poses is significant given his position in the Georgian government. These factors\nmust be balanced against the strength of the U.S./Georgian relationship. Since its\nindependence, the U.S. has made tremendous investments in Georgia\u2019s economy. U.S.\nadvisors are in Georgia engaged in tasks ranging from border security enhancement to\nmilitary training. Georgian troops have served under U.S. command in Operation Iraqi\nFreedom. Although the possibility of Russian aggression and intimidation still exists,\nGeorgia has been undeterred in strengthening its ties to the U.S.\nApplicant spent nearly half of his career in the CIA. He spent two of these years\nin the former Soviet Union, recruiting spies to collect intelligence. This work was\ninherently dangerous because some of the potential spies in the network he managed\nwere themselves foreign intelligence agents. He could have been subjected to life\nimprisonment or death if any of these spies were merely feigning interest in working\nsurreptitiously for the U.S. in order to expose his cover. Working in this high-pressure,\nlife-threatening environment, Applicant excelled earning the CIA\u2019s Certificate of\nExceptional Accomplishment in 1983. After the Soviet Union collapsed, Applicant left\nthe CIA and pursued several private endeavors focused on developing the civil, military,\nand economic infrastructures of the newly independent countries. Although these\nprojects have not always succeeded, they have always been consistent with U.S.\nobjectives.\nI conclude that the strength of the U.S./Georgian relationship, together with\nApplicant\u2019s exceptional and unique career history, outweigh the security risks generated\nby his Georgian in-laws. Applicant has mitigated the foreign influence security concerns\ngenerated by his Georgian in-laws. Clearance is granted.\n\n8\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline B:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1g:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                             \nMARC E. CURRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

McCormack, Esquire\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP) on May 20, 2007. On June 24, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing the security\nconcerns under Guideline F that provided the basis for its decision to deny him a\nsecurity clearance and refer the matter to an administrative judge. The action was taken\nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense as of\nSeptember 1, 2006.\n \nApplicant, acting pro se, answered the SOR allegations in writing on June 23,\n2008, and he requested a hearing before a DOHA administrative judge. On August 5,\n2008, the case was assigned to me to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for him. On September 4,\nOctober 27, 2008\n\nConcerning the specific objections to portions of exhibits A and B, the absence of a handwritten\n1\nsignature on a settlement confirmation letter did not render Exhibit A inadmissible. It was issued on the\nletterhead of the law firm collecting the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a and contained the typewritten name of the firm in\nthe signature block. As for Exhibit B, the government  had legitimate concerns about the authentication of\nInternet-based complaints about the debt consolidation firm, and they were afforded little, if any, weight, but\nthe document also contained Applicant\u2019s request to terminate his account and evidence of his payments to\nthe debt consolidation firm. \nApplicant testified he did not look into alternative sources of funding (Tr. 109).\n2\n2\n2008, I scheduled a hearing for October 2, 2008. On September 9, 2008, counsel for\nApplicant entered his appearance and requested a brief continuance. I granted his\nrequest on September 10, 2008, Department Counsel having no objection. On\nSeptember 18, 2008, I rescheduled the hearing for October 7, 2008.\n \nThe parties appeared as scheduled on October 7, 2008. Five government\nexhibits (Ex. 1-5) and four Applicant exhibits (Ex. A-D) were admitted, over the\ngovernment\u2019s objections about portions of exhibits A and B.  Applicant also testified on\n1\nhis behalf, as reflected in a transcript (Tr.) received on October 20, 2008. Based on a\nreview of the pleadings, exhibits, and hearing testimony, eligibility for access to\nclassified information is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nDOHA alleged under Guideline F, financial considerations, that Applicant owed\nabout $18,379 on a debt in collection (SOR \u00b6 1.a), and that he had a history of not\nmeeting his financial obligations as evidenced by his recent settlement between\nSeptember 2007 and January 2008 of about $45,695 in delinquent credit card debt\n(SOR \u00b6 1.b). Applicant denied the allegations on the basis that he had settled all his\noutstanding debt, was not financially overextended, and lives within his means.  He\nadded that he had learned a valuable lesson and maintains a single credit card account\nwith a minimal balance. After considering the evidence of record, I make the following\nfindings of fact.\nApplicant is a 56-year-old security guard who has worked for the same defense\ncontractor since February 1979 (Ex. 1, Tr. 41). He held a security clearance throughout\nmost of his employ until it was suspended on issuance of the SOR (Tr. 37, 42). He\ncontinues to drive company executives but requires his clearance so that he can handle\nclassified documents placed in his office\u2019s control (Tr. 58).\nApplicant relied on credit extensively for home improvements, college tuition for\nthe younger of his two sons, and some travel (Tr. 45, 76). About $30,000 went to put a\nnew roof and windows on his residence (Tr. 77, 109-10), which had been built in the\n1940s (Tr. 112). He inherited the house from his father in 1989 and paid off the\nmortgage ten years later (Tr. 61). He charged about $20,000 of his son\u2019s college tuition\n(Tr. 107),  and about $5,000 or $6,000 for family vacations (Tr. 78-79). Applicant paid\n2\nabout double the minimum payments, approximately $200 per month on each of four\n\nApplicant testified that he was current on the four accounts (Tr. 45). His credit  report of June 2007\n3\n(Ex. 5) shows a last activity date of November 2005 for his Discover Card account, but a more recent credit\nreport of September 2008 (Ex. C) shows it was current until June 2006, which is consistent with his testimony.\n3\ncredit card accounts (Tr. 75, 97). He had no problems making the payments. He was\ninvolved in a long-time cohabitant relationship with a woman with whom he had two\nsons, who are now grown (Tr. 40-41). She was employed and contributing to the\nhousehold expenses (Tr. 95).\nIn November 2005, Applicant and his significant other of some 30 years (Tr. 40,\n74) terminated their relationship. Without her income, Applicant found it difficult to make\nhis payments on the approximate $64,000 in accumulated credit card debt (Ex. 5, Tr.\n44-45, 80).  To ensure that he could continue to make payments (Tr. 45-46, 73),\n3\nApplicant retained the services of a debt consolidation company that he found on the\nInternet in about May 2006 (Ex. B, Tr. 46). In good faith, Applicant set up an account\nwith the company and arranged for automatic withdrawal of $560 per month from his\nchecking account for five years starting that month (Tr. 47-48, 71). Applicant understood\nthat the debt consolidation company would in turn pay four consumer credit card\nbalances for him (Ex. 48-49). From May 25, 2006 to September 25, 2007, the company\ndirectly and through a client services company debited a total of $560 per month from\nhis checking account (about half for fees), but made no payments to Applicant\u2019s\ncreditors (Tr. 73). Applicant assumed his creditors were being paid, and he did not notify\nthe creditors of the debt consolidation agreement or confirm receipt of payments by the\ncredit lenders (Tr. 50-52).\nWith no payments being made on four credit card accounts after May 2006, the\naccounts were subsequently referred for collection in the amounts of $12,600, $18,376,\n$19,187, and $14,408 (Ex. 5). In late 2006, Applicant began receiving calls from the\ncreditors demanding payment of the delinquent balances (Tr. 50-51, 100). Applicant\ninformed the creditors that he had arranged with a debt consolidation company to make\npayments on his behalf (Tr. 51). He called the debt consolidation firm, and was told that\nthey were handling it and he should not be concerned (Tr. 52). Applicant understood\nfrom the debt consolidation company that it was still negotiating with his creditors.\nSometime thereafter, Applicant began receiving calls from collection agencies. He told\nthe debt consolidation firm that something had to be done, but he did not cancel the\nagreement (Tr. 101-04).\nIn May 2007, Applicant got married (Ex. 1). Applicant\u2019s spouse is a certified\npublic accountant who works as a supervisor in a public accounting firm (Ex. D). In mid-\nMay 2007, Applicant took out a $20,000 loan from his 401(k) account to pay some bills\n(Tr. 90, 99).\nOn May 20, 2007, Applicant completed an e-QIP on which he responded\nnegatively to questions 28.a (\u201cIn the last 7 years, have you been over 180 days\ndelinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d) and 28.b (\u201cAre you currently over 90 days delinquent on\nany debt(s)?\u201d) (Ex. 1, Tr. 53). His account was still being debited by the debt\n\n4\nconsolidation company at $560 per month (\u201cI had all this money tied up in this thing and\nI was hoping it was going to work for me.\u201d Tr. 101-04). \n \nA check of Applicant\u2019s credit on June 20, 2007, disclosed the four delinquent\ncredit card accounts. Applicant owed balances of $4,793 on a credit card account with\nthe credit union at work, and $175 on a gasoline credit card account. They were rated\nas current and being repaid on agreed upon terms (Ex. 5). Within a month or so,\nApplicant was interviewed by a government investigator and questioned about his\nseriously delinquent accounts (Tr. 53-54).\nApplicant contacted his creditors himself as he \u201cdidn\u2019t think [repayment through\nthe debt consolidation firm] was going to work.\u201d (Tr. 54) Over the next few months, he\nworked out settlement agreements with the collection agencies on three of his four\ndelinquent credit card accounts (Tr. 55-56). On September 10, 2007, he made an initial\npayment of $2,000 toward settling his $19,187 delinquent Visa card debt (Ex. A).\nOn September 17, 2007, the debt consolidation firm, acting through its affiliated\nbanking services company, notified Applicant that he had $2,545.20 in set aside\nbalances in his account as of August 24, 2007 (Ex. B). In October 2007, Applicant\ninformed the banking services company that he wanted to close his account. Applicant\ncancelled the authorization for the debt consolidation company and its affiliate to debit\nhis account by issuing stop payment orders with his credit union (Ex. B). Applicant was\nrefunded about $2,000 of the $9,500 he paid to the debt consolidation firm (Tr. 57, 71).\nOn or about January 16, 2008, Applicant was notified that he could settle his\n$14,408.89 balance of a delinquent oil/national credit card by paying $7,204.44 in a\nlump sum within 15 days. Applicant paid it on January 30, 2008. With a final payment of\n$9,900, he also settled the $19,187 delinquent Visa credit card account for $12,000.\nThe next day, he paid $3,630.06 to settle his $12,100.02 Discover card balance. (Ex. 2,\nEx. A) Applicant obtained the funds from his and his spouse\u2019s accounts (Tr. 56), and\nthrough a loan taken out against his retirement account (401(k) account) at work (Ex. 2,\nTr. 63-64). As of September 2008, the loan was still being repaid directly out of his pay\nat $117.43 per week (Ex. C).\nIn February 2008, DOHA asked Applicant to update the status of his four\ndelinquent credit card accounts. On April 7, 2008, Applicant furnished documentation\nshowing that three of his four delinquent credit card accounts had been settled. He\nindicated that he had contacted the fourth creditor, to whom he owed $18,379, and was\nstill working on resolving that debt. Applicant notified DOHA that he had made about 18\nmonths of payments to a debt consolidation firm that failed to perform, so he had to\nsettle with the creditors. Applicant estimated that after payment of monthly expenses,\nhis spouse\u2019s $319 car payment, and $200 on her credit cards, he and his spouse have\na net monthly remainder of $2,873 (Ex. 2). He failed to account for a mortgage payment\non a two-family rental property owned by his spouse (Ex. C, Tr. 39, 66, 69-70).\n\n5\nAs of June 2008, Applicant had two open credit card accounts with balances: a\ngasoline card with a balance of $61 and a MasterCard account with a balance of $137.\nBoth were rated as current (Ex. 3). On July 2, 2008, Applicant was notified by the\nassignee collecting his remaining delinquent account that its client had agreed to settle\nthe $18,379 balance (SOR \u00b6 1.a)  on receipt of $15,825.17 by July 17, 2008. Applicant\nmade the payment by cashier\u2019s check dated July 9, 2008, which was accepted as\nsettlement in full (Ex. A).\nIn about July/August 2008, Applicant took out a five-year, $10,000 loan against\nhis 401(k) account to pay for legal representation at his security clearance hearing (Tr.\n64). The loan payments of $43.49 weekly are being taken directly out of his paycheck\n(Ex. C). He and his spouse implemented a household budget around that time (Tr. 82).\nAs of late September 2008, Applicant and his spouse had joint assets totaling\nabout $881,087.07, which included his home valued at $452,600 and $146,067.53 in his\n401(k) account at work. Applicant had an outstanding balance of $51 on a gasoline\ncredit card account, and it was current. After payment of their joint expenses and debts\ntotaling $5,284, they had monthly discretionary funds in excess of $1,300 (Ex. C, Tr.\n67). As of October 7, 2008, Applicant had paid the balance of his gasoline credit card.\nHis other credit card account had a balance of about $3,000 because he relied on credit\nto pay a portion of his attorney\u2019s fee (Tr. 83).\nApplicant now understands that it was poor judgment on his part to have\ncontinued making the payments to the debt consolidation firm after he had been notified\nby the creditors that they were not receiving payment (Tr. 102). He is current on his\npresent obligations and did not intend for any of his financial accounts to become\ndelinquent (Tr. 59).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\n\n6\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthat the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG & 18:\nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nApplicant incurred sizeable credit card balances on four credit card accounts that\nwith interest totaled about $64,000 as of May 2006. While the accounts were current,\nthe balances were so high that he had trouble making the payments after he and the\nmother of his two sons ended their relationship in November 2005. While a significant\nportion of the debt (about $50,000) was for expenses that were necessary (roof, new\n\n7\nwindows for an older home) and/or reasonable (college tuition for his son), a security\nrisk is raised when one is so financially overextended. Given his inability to satisfy these\ndebts in full on his income at the time, AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy\ndebts\u201d) is implicated.\nIn mitigation, once he realized that he was going to have trouble keeping the\naccounts current without some help, Applicant retained the services of a debt\nconsolidation company to negotiate on his behalf with his creditors. Applicant fulfilled his\nobligations under the agreement in that he paid the company $560 per month for about\n17 months. This qualifies as a \u201cgood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise\nresolve debts\u201d under AG 20(d). AG \u00b6 20(b) (\u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial\nproblems were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances\u201d) also applies because the\ndelinquencies were caused directly by the malfeasance and/or neglect of the debt\nconsolidation firm upon which Applicant relied in good faith to his detriment.\nTo be sure, Applicant should have checked into the business practices of the\ndebt resolution company before he arranged for automatic withdrawal of monies from\nhis checking account. It can reasonably be argued that Applicant was financially\nirresponsible in waiting until October 2007 to terminate his relationship with the debt\nconsolidation company. He learned in late 2006 from his creditors that they were not\ngetting paid, and collection agencies started contacting him in or before May/June 2007.\nYet, in all fairness to Applicant, he had already paid more than $7,000 to the debt\nconsolidation company by May 2007. His hope that the debt consolidation company\nwould fulfill its obligations is understandable given the circumstances. Moreover,\nApplicant has settled the delinquent accounts. Over the September 2007/July 2008\nperiod, Applicant paid more than $38,000 to his creditors. While a portion of the funding\nwas from a loan taken out against his 401(k), the loan is being repaid directly from his\nwages. AG \u00b6 20(c) (\u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control\u201d)\napplies. His financial problem has been resolved and his finances are clearly under\ncontrol.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors listed\nat AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\n\n8\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \nThe Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole person analysis in\nfinancial cases stating:\nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the\nconcept of \u201c\u2018meaningful track record\u2019 necessarily includes evidence of\nactual debt reduction through payment of debts.\u201d However, an applicant is\nnot required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each and\nevery debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant\ndemonstrate that he has \u2018 . . . established a plan to resolve his financial\nproblems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u2019 The Judge\ncan reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial situation\nand his actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant\u2019s plan for\nthe reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See\nDirective \u00b6  E2.2(a) (\u2018Available, reliable information about the person, past\nand present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching\na determination.\u2019). There is no requirement that a plan provide for\npayments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable\nplan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such\ndebts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts\nactually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in\nthe SOR.\nISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations omitted).\nApplicant\u2019s accumulation of about $64,000 in credit card debt shows a naivete in\nfinancial matters. He testified that he did not consider an alternative, such as a student\nloan to cover his son\u2019s tuition. He also showed questionable financial judgment in\nauthorizing a company known to him only via the Internet to debit his account each\nmonth without checking into the firm\u2019s business practices. Yet, he clearly did not intend\nto defraud his creditors and has settled the accounts in good faith. He showed a\n\u201cmeaningful track record\u201d in attempting to resolve his debt through the debt\nconsolidation firm. His current financial situation is sound and he learned a valuable\nlesson that he is not likely to repeat. Based on a totality of the evidence, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to restore the security clearance that he held\nthroughout much of his 29 years in the employ of the same defense contractor.\n\n9\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of the record in this case, it is clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant Applicant a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is\ngranted.\n                                        \nELIZABETH M. MATCHINSKI\nAdministrative Judge\n",

He requested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. I received\nthe case assignment on February 10, 2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on\nFebruary 18, 2009, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on March 12, 2009. The\ngovernment offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 13, which were received without objection.\nApplicant testified on his own behalf. He submitted Exhibits (AE) A through E, without\nMarch 25, 2009\n\n2\nobjection. DOHA received the transcript of the (Tr.) on March 19, 2009. Based upon a\nreview of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to\nclassified information is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated November 24, 2008, Applicant admitted the\nfactual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a- 1.e. of the SOR. He also provided additional information to\nsupport his request for eligibility for a security clearance. \nApplicant is 54-years-old. His first marriage ended in divorce in 1998. He has two\ngrown children from that marriage. He remarried in August 2005 and he and his wife\nhave an 11-year-old daughter. \nAfter college in 1976, he joined the United States Navy. He served on active duty\nas a Naval Officer until November 1997 (AE A). He has been with his current employer\nfor approximately eight years (Tr. 35). He has held a security clearance since 1977 (Tr.\n37).\nIn 1992, Applicant had an altercation with an ex-girlfriend in her office (Tr. 51).\nWhile she was sitting in a roller chair, he pushed her and she fell (Tr. 67). Applicant was\ncharged with (1) Battery and Serious Bodily Injury and (2) and (3) Battery. He pleaded\nno contest to Count (3) (GE 9). He was sentenced to one day in jail and two years\nprobation. (GE 8). He received group counseling for six to eight weeks (Tr. 52). He also\nsuccessfully completed his probation.\nIn September 2002, Applicant was at a softball game and consumed\napproximately eight beers (GE 4, Tr. 57). He was charged with Driving Attempting to\nDrive Vehicle Under the Influence Per Se. He was given Probation Before Judgment\n(PBJ) and required to attend alcohol counseling. He completed alcohol counseling in a\ngroup setting from February 3 until April 3, 2003.\nIn May 2003, Applicant was attending a Christmas party. He believed he had\nbeen drinking in a responsible manner based on the information he learned in his\nalcohol counseling classes. He was charged with Driving or Attempting to Drive Vehicle\nWhile Under the Influence. He was found guilty and sentenced to ten days in jail and a\nmandatory alcohol education program. He attended alcohol counseling for\napproximately six months. He does not drink and drive since that time. He is diabetic\nand does not drink much at all anymore (Tr. 59). If he has a glass of wine at home, he\ndoes not drive. \nIn September 2004, Applicant and his wife were at home. She had been drinking\nand was upset. He left the argument by leaving the house. She called the police.\nApplicant received a warrant for his arrest a few days later. He denied hitting her. He\nwas charged with Assault-Second Degree (GE 2). The charge was Nolle Prosequi. He\ncompleted the anger management classes for six weeks in 2004 (Tr. 46).\n\n3\nIn July 2006, Applicant and his wife were on the back porch of their home. He\npushed her away in an argument. She was yelling and screaming and the police were\ncalled. He was charged with misdemeanor Assault-Second Degree. He pleaded guilty.\nHe was sentenced to 90 days in jail, with 88 days suspended, 18 months probation, and\nenrollment in anger management. He attended abuser intervention classes for 20\nweeks. This class was all male and focused on relating and communicating with a\nspouse. He was taught not to overreact to situations and how to defuse stressful\nsituations with his spouse. His probation ended in April 2008 (GE 2, 3).\nApplicant and his wife are still living together but are contemplating divorce. They\ndo not want to separate now due to the current economy. They have educational\nexpenses for their daughter. Applicant\u2019s wife is looking for a place to live at some point\nin the future. He explained they have a \u201cworking relationship\u201d and still function as a\nfamily (Tr. 26).\nIn 2007, Applicant received a Letter of Appreciation for outstanding effort and\naccomplishments in developing and implementing an Information Assurance Program.\nHe collaborated with a military agency to improve procedures for the program which\nresulted in better reporting and compliance (AE E).\nApplicant\u2019s recent performance evaluation (2007-2008) rates him as Superior,\nwhich is the highest rating. He is an outstanding employee with a strong work ethic. He\nhas a positive attitude and he produces quality work, which is technically accurate and\nthoroughly researched (AE B). He was also rated as Superior in his prior evaluations\n(AE C, and D).\nApplicant is entitled to wear the following: National Defense Service Medal; Navy\nBattle \u201cE\u201d Ribbon; Navy Expeditionary Medal; Navy Commendation Medal (2  Award);\nnd\nNavy Unit Commendation, Letter of Commendation, Southwest Asia Service Medal\nW/Bronze Star, and Kuwait Liberation (AE A).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\n\n4\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct, \u201cCriminal\nactivity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By it\u2019s\nvery nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws,\nrules and regulations.\u201d\nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying, \u201c(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses,\u201d and \u201c(c) allegation\nor admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally\ncharged, formally prosecuted or convicted.\u201d\n\n5\nApplicant admitted that was arrested and charged on five separate occasions for\na criminal offense. He received several convictions for these charges from 1992 until\n2006. There are two alcohol-related offenses and three assault charges. This is\nsufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions.\nAG \u00b6 32 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment;\n\u00a9 evidence that the person did not commit the offense; and\n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the\npassage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job\ntraining or higher education, good employment record, or constructive community\ninvolvement.\nApplicant has provided mitigation under this guideline. The alcohol incidents\noccurred in 2002 and 2003. Applicant has completed extensive alcohol counseling. He\ndoes not drink and drive. He moderates his alcohol consumption because of his diabetic\ncondition. He has not had any other incidents. He has shown successful rehabilitation.\nApplicant has had two incidents of domestic violence. In 1992, he pleaded No\nContest to a battery charge. He admits the conduct was a mistake and bad judgment on\nhis part. He and his second wife were having disputes about family matters and they\nargued. The police were called both times. Applicant denied the assault in 2004 and the\ncharges were nolle prosequi. This provides evidence that he did not commit the offense.\nHe pleaded guilty in 2006. He completed both anger management and abuser\nintervention programs for a total of 26 weeks. He learned in the second set of\ncounseling classes that there are appropriate ways to handle arguments with a spouse.\nHe acknowledged responsibility for his behavior in 2006. He completed his probation in\nApril 2008. He and his wife were poised for divorce but are staying together for the\npresent time for the sake of their daughter. Thus, AG \u00b6 32(a) and 32(b) (d) apply in this\ncase. \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\n\n6\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2\u00a9, the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. The decision to grantor\ndeny a security clearance requires a careful weighing of all relevant factors, both good\nand bad. In so doing, an administrative judge must review all the evidence of record, not\na single item in isolation, to determine if a security concern is shown. A determination of\nan applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance should not be made as punishment for\nspecific past conduct, but on a reasonable and careful evaluation of all the evidence of\nrecord to decide if a nexus exists between established facts and a legitimate security\nconcern. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has dedicated his service\nto the military and defense contracting world for more than 32 years. As an Officer, he\nearned may awards and medals. He has had a security clearance during that time. He\nhas an excellent work record. \nApplicant has acknowledged his responsibility for his past mistakes. He has\ncompleted counseling for alcohol, anger management, and abuser intervention classes.\nHe has learned his lessons. He is working to provide for his daughter. He and his wife\nacknowledge their problems. Applicant has learned a new method for communicating\nwith his spouse and has eschewed physical violence in their relationship. He has shown\ninsight into the problems that arose with the domestic violence. He has paid for his\nmistakes. He successfully completed his probation in 2008.\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility, judgment, and suitability for a security clearance. For all these\nreasons, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from criminal\nconduct. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\n\n7\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                              \n_________________\nNOREEN A. LYNCH\nAdministrative Judge\n",

In addition to the Executive\nOrder and Directive, this case is also adjudicated under the revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining\nEligibility for Access to Classified Information (Revised Guidelines) approved by the President on December\n29, 2005. The Revised Guidelines were then modified by the Defense Department, effective September 1,\n2006. They supersede or replace the guidelines published in Enclosure 2 to the Directive.

Acting under the relevant Executive Order,\nDoD Directive, and Revised Guidelines,  the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n1\n(DOHA) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant on November 14, 2008. The\nSOR is equivalent to an administrative complaint and it details the factual basis for the\nJune 22, 2009\n\n The government\u2019s brief includes several attachments referred to as items. They are referred to as exhibits\n2\nherein. \n2\naction. The issues in this case fall under Guideline H for drug involvement, Guideline G\nfor alcohol consumption, Guideline J for criminal conduct, and Guideline E for personal\nconduct. \nApplicant\u2019s four-page response to the SOR is dated December 5, 2008, and he\nelected a decision without a hearing. Accordingly, the case will be decided based on the\nwritten record in lieu of a hearing. \nOn January 21, 2009, the government submitted its written case consisting of all\nrelevant and material information that could be adduced at a hearing. This so-called file\nof relevant material (FORM)  was mailed to Applicant and received by him on January\n2\n28, 2009. He did not submit a documentary response to the FORM within the allowed\n30-day period. The case was assigned to me May 1, 2009. For the reasons discussed\nbelow, this case is decided against Applicant. \nFindings of Fact\nBased on the record evidence as a whole, the following facts are established by\nsubstantial evidence.\nApplicant is a 26-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He graduated from\nhigh school in 2002 and thereafter entered college. He appears to have completed a\njoint-degree program as he was awarded both a BSBA and MBA in May 2007.

He used marijuana with varying\nfrequency during the period January 1998 to March 2007. He estimates using marijuana\napproximately 100 times. He also purchased marijuana a number of times during the\nsame period. In addition to marijuana use, he used the following illegal drugs: (1)\necstasy about three times during 2006\u20132007; (2) mushrooms about two times during\n2006\u20132007; \n(3) \ncocaine \nabout \nthree \ntimes \nduring \n2004\u20132006; \nand \n(4)\nmethamphetamine once in 2001.

His history includes binge drinking as recently as July\n2008 when he drank 12 beers and 2 mixed drinks during a 12-hour period at a daylong\nparty (Exhibit 6 at 2). \nApplicant admitted a history of criminal conduct. It consists mainly of his drug-\nrelated conduct (use and possession of illegal drugs) and alcohol-related offenses\nmentioned above. In addition to those matters, he was arrested for the felony offense of\nburglary in 2001. He accepted a plea bargain wherein he pleaded guilty and was\nsentenced to probation for two years, community service for 80 hours, house arrest for\none month, and he was required to undergo a mental-health evaluation.

In total, he has had eight traffic\nviolations (e.g., speeding) during the period 2001\u20132008. In addition, he was fired from\nhis employment with Walmart when he violated a store policy by pushing too many carts\nat once (the maximum was six and he had ten). \nPolicies\nThis section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an\nindustrial security clearance case. To start, no one has a right to a security clearance.3\nAs noted by the Supreme Court in 1988 in the case of Department of Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe\nclearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if\nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d  A favorable decision establishes eligibility of an\n4\napplicant to be granted a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-\nsecret information.  An unfavorable decision: (1) denies any application; (2) revokes any\n5\nexisting security clearance; and (3) prevents access to classified information at any\nlevel and retention of any existing security clearance.  Under Egan, Executive Order\n6\n10865, and the Directive, any doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed\naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of protecting national security.\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for\naccess to classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting\n7\n\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n8\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n9\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n10\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n11\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n12\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n13\n Revised Guidelines at 17\u201318 (setting forth the security concern as well as the disqualifying and mitigating\n14\nconditions). \n Revised Guidelines at 17. \n15\n4\nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An\n8\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nfacts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate\n9\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme\n10\nCourt stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.11\nThe agency appellate authority has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s\nfindings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.12\nThe Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when\nevaluating a person\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions\n(DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance\ndecision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon consideration\nof all the relevant and material information, the pertinent criteria and adjudication\nfactors, and the whole-person concept. A person granted access to classified\ninformation enters into a special relationship with the government. The government\nmust be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in those persons to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. The decision to deny a person a security\nclearance is not a determination of an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination\n13\nthat the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has established for\ngranting eligibility for a security clearance.\nAnalysis\nThe SOR here alleges four security guidelines, which are described below.\nUnder Guideline H for drug involvement,  the security concern is that \u201cuse of an\n14\nillegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions about an individual's\nreliability and trustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and because it\nraises questions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and\nregulations.\u201d The definition of drug abuse is \u201cthe illegal use of a drug or use of a legal\ndrug in a manner that deviates from approved medical direction.\u201d15\n\n Revised Guidelines at 15\u201316 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating\n16\nconditions). \n Revised Guidelines at 21\u201322 (setting forth the security concern as well as the disqualifying and mitigating\n17\nconditions). \n Revised Guidelines at 10\u201312 (setting forth the security concern as well as the disqualifying and mitigating\n18\nconditions). \n5\nUnder Guideline G for alcohol consumption,  the security concern is that\n16\n\u201cexcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or\nthe failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability\nand trustworthiness.\u201d\nUnder Guideline J for criminal conduct,  the security concern is that \u201ccriminal\n17\nactivity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its\nvery nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws,\nrules and regulations.\u201d\nUnder Guideline E for personal conduct,  the security concern addresses\n18\n\u201cconduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness\nto comply with rules and regulations [that may] raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. Of special interest\nis any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance\nprocess or any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\u201d\nBased on the record evidence as a whole, this case raises multiple security\nconcerns. For example, the disqualifying information includes the following: (1) a history\nof illegal drug abuse starting in about 1998 and ending in about in 2007; (2) a history of\nexcessive consumption of alcohol, to include alcohol-related incidents away from work\nand binge consumption; (3) a history of criminal conduct, to include a single serious\ncrime and multiple lessor offenses; and (4) a history of questionable personal conduct\nas shown by the multiple traffic violations establishing a pattern of unwillingness to\ncomply with rules or regulations. Aggravating the situation is that Applicant\u2019s use of\necstacy in August 2007 occurred but a few months after he began working for his\nemployer, a major defense contractor, which presumably has a drug-free workforce\npolicy as all major defense contractors do. \nThe various mitigating conditions under the four guidelines have been reviewed\nand considered in light of the record evidence as a whole, and the evidence is not\nsufficient to mitigate and overcome the security concerns. For Guideline H, the evidence\nis insufficient due to the length of Applicant\u2019s drug abuse (1998 to 2007), the frequency\nof his drug abuse (using marijuana about 100 times), and the recency of his drug abuse\n(as recently as August 2007). For Guideline G, the evidence is insufficient because\nApplicant continues to drink alcohol to excess as evidenced by his July 2008 binge-\ndrinking episode when he drank 12 beers and 2 mixed drinks at a party. For Guideline\nJ, the evidence is insufficient because, given that Applicant  continues to drink alcohol\n\n Revised Guidelines at 1\u20132. \n19\n This allegation is decided for Applicant because taking several alcohol-related classes does not raise a DC\n20\nunder the guideline. \n6\nto excess, additional alcohol-related criminal conduct cannot be ruled out. In reaching\nthis conclusion on Guideline J, I took into account that some of his criminal conduct took\nplace when he as a juvenile (under the age of 18). For Guideline E, the evidence is\ninsufficient as well. The multiple traffic offenses, the most recent of which took place in\n2008, standing alone are not too serious. But when combined with the other derogatory\nevidence in the case, the evidence as a whole paints a picture of a 26-year-old man\nwho has demonstrated a long-term pattern of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness,\nand unreliability. These circumstances raise questions and doubts about his suitability\nfor access to classified information. \nUnder the whole-person concept,  an administrative judge must evaluate a\n19\nperson\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the person\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed in the Revised Guidelines as follows: (1) the nature,\nextent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct,\nto include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;\n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\nAfter weighing the record evidence as a whole and giving it due consideration\nunder the whole-person concept, Applicant did not present sufficient evidence to\nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. At this point in time, it is simply too\nsoon to tell if Applicant\u2019s history of misbehavior involving drug abuse, alcohol abuse,\ncriminal conduct, and traffic offenses is a thing of the past or if his history is a harbinger\nof things to  come. Applicant did not meet his ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a\nfavorable clearance decision. This case is decided against Applicant. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline H:\nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a\u20131.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline G:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs 2.a, c\u2013f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor Applicant20\n\n This allegation is decided for Applicant because I cannot hold it against him that he pushed too many carts\n21\nat W almart when he was 18 years old. \n7\nParagraph 3, Guideline J:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs 3a.\u20133c:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 4, Guideline E:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs 4.a\u20134.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 4.h:\nFor Applicant21\nSubparagraphs i\u2013j:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of\nnational security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The government alleged in the SOR that Applicant owes approximately $24,675 for 12 delinquent debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.l). Applicant admitted with explanation all of the SOR allegations except for SOR \u00b6 1.l, about which she claimed to have no knowledge. Applicant also asserted in response to the SOR that some of the debts alleged were duplicate entries resulting from transfer of accounts among collection agencies.

Blank, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMALONE, Matthew E., Administrative Judge:\nBased upon a review of the pleadings, the government\u2019s exhibits (Gx.),\nApplicant\u2019s exhibits (Ax.), and Applicant\u2019s testimony, her request for a security\nclearance is granted.\nOn January 30, 2008, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for\nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) to obtain a security clearance required for her job with\na defense contractor, where she works as a fiber optics assembler. (Gx. 1) On May 27,\n2008, after reviewing the results of the ensuing background investigation, adjudicators\nfor the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) sent to Applicant\ninterrogatories to obtain clarification of and/or additional information about adverse\ninformation in his background.  After reviewing the results of the background\n1\ninvestigation, including her response to the interrogatories (Gx. 2), DOHA adjudicators\nJanuary 21, 2009\n\n Required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and by DoD Directive 5220.6 (Directive), as amended.\n2\n Adjudication of this case is controlled by the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, approved by the President on\n3\nDecember 29, 2005,which were implemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006. Pending\nofficial revision of the Directive, the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines supercede the guidelines listed in\nEnclosure 2 to the Directive.\n2\nwere unable to make a preliminary affirmative finding  that it is clearly consistent with\n2\nthe national interest to allow Applicant access to classified information. On July 25,\n2008, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts which\nraise security concerns addressed in the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG)  under\n3\nGuideline F (financial considerations).\nApplicant timely responded to the SOR and requested a hearing. The case was\nassigned to me on September 9, 2008, and I convened a hearing on October 22, 2008.\nThe parties appeared as scheduled. The government presented four exhibits (Gx. 1 - 4).\nApplicant testified, presented one witness, and submitted four exhibits (Ax. A - D). I also\nleft the record open after the hearing to receive additional relevant information. On\nOctober 30, 2008, I received a post-hearing submission, which is included in the record\nwithout objection as Ax. E. DOHA received the transcript of hearing (Tr.) on November\n6, 2008. \nFindings of Fact\nThe government alleged in the SOR that Applicant owes approximately $24,675\nfor 12 delinquent debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.l). Applicant admitted with explanation all of the\nSOR allegations except for SOR \u00b6 1.l, about which she claimed to have no knowledge.\nApplicant also asserted in response to the SOR that some of the debts alleged were\nduplicate entries resulting from transfer of accounts among collection agencies. I have\nalso made the following findings of relevant fact. \nApplicant is 51 years old and has been employed by a defense contractor since\nJanuary 2006. She and her husband have been married since February 1994. He is a\nveteran of the United States Air Force who served in Vietnam in 1965. Since 2003, he\nhas been 100% disabled from the effects of Agent Orange. He is confined to a wheel\nchair after two partial amputations of one foot and he is legally blind.\nFor 20 years after he left the military, Applicant\u2019s husband worked in law\nenforcement, but usually held additional jobs in the television and electronics repair\njobs. His medical problems started with diabetes and he has received medical treatment\nat various civilian and Veterans Administration (VA) facilities over the past eight years.\nIn 1997, Applicant and her husband opened their own television and electronics repair\ncompany. Records indicate the company had several employees, a modest fleet of\ntrucks, and service contracts with several businesses in their area. They used a\ncombination of business credit accounts (for supplies, gas, etc.) and personal credit for\npurchases not covered by their business credit. Applicant was employed by the\nbusiness as a bookkeeper and office manager. Her husband ran the business and\n\n3\nmuch of his efforts were aimed at creating new business and servicing existing\naccounts and customers. \nIn 2003, Applicant\u2019s husband\u2019s health took a turn for the worse in the form of\ndiabetes. After a partial amputation of his left foot, complications set in causing\nextensive hospitalization and a six-month recuperation period. Her husband was unable\nto tend to their business, employees left and the business ultimately failed. Between\nabout 2000 and 2003, Applicant and her husband were able to realize about $70,000 in\nannual personal income from the business.\nApplicant\u2019s husband was evaluated in 2003 by the VA and it was determined that\nhis medical problems resulted from exposure to Agent Orange while he was in Vietnam.\nHe was certified as 100% disabled and has not worked since. However, it took the VA\nalmost 18 months to begin his disability payments. In the meantime, Applicant found\nwork as a corrections officer with the local police department. Because her $1,560\nmonthly take home pay was the only household income until sometime in 2005, much of\ntheir personal and business credit accounts went unpaid. By the time the VA sent them\nnearly $40,000 in past due benefits, the mortgage on their house was nine months past\ndue and in foreclosure. They used the money to bring their mortgage current and to pay\noff their business creditors and some personal creditors.\nWhen Applicant submitted her e-QIP, she disclosed the existence of several\ndelinquent debts and stated they resulted from the loss of their business. (Gx. 1) Credit\nreports obtained during Applicant\u2019s background investigation (Gx. 3 and 4) attribute to\nher approximately $24,675 in delinquent debt for the 12 accounts as listed in the SOR.\nOf the debts alleged, Applicant asserted the $1,125 hospital debt listed in SOR 1.a is\nthe subject of an insurance dispute. She claimed the medical care provided was for her\nhusband in 2001 and that the hospital should have submitted TriCare paperwork to\nreceive payment. Applicant spoke with the hospital but has not submitted any claims to\nTriCare or generated any correspondence regarding this dispute. (Answer to SOR; Tr.\n75 - 78)\nThe debts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e - 1.g were for debts left to Applicant and her\nhusband by his late mother\u2019s estate. Applicant is working with the creditors to have\nthese items removed from her credit history. (Answer; Gx. 2; Ax. D; Tr. 81 - 82) Also,\nthe debts listed at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.I are the same debt reported by the original\ncreditor and a collection agency. Applicant also claimed the debts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b\nand 1.c are the same account; however, a review of the credit reports in the record\nshows they have different account numbers and were opened at different times. Finally,\nin response to the SOR, Applicant denied the debt at SOR \u00b6 1.l was hers; however, in\nresponse to financial interrogatories in June 2008, she acknowledged that debt as one\nof those that went unpaid when their business failed. The creditor is a collection agency\nfor an unknown account. (Gx. 2 - 4)\nApplicant went to work for her current employer in August 2007. She now brings\nhome $2,230 each month. Her husband\u2019s disability payments total about $3,166 each\nmonth. The house they bought in 1999 is worth about $175,000, and the balance on\ntheir mortgage is about $117,000. Applicant and her husband would like to sell their\n\n Directive. 6.3.\n4\n4\nhouse but the real estate market is not currently in their favor. They would use the\nproceeds for debt repayment, to move closer to her work site, and to lower their living\nexpenses. A personal financial statement Applicant submitted (Gx. 2) in June 2008,\nreflects a net monthly cashflow of about $156. After their regular expense, and their\nmonthly mortgage and two monthly car loan payments totaling more than $700, the only\ncredit card they are paying is a Sears account at $20 per month. Applicant and her\nhusband have not obtained any credit counseling or other help to either resolve their\ndebts or to improve their money management skills. They were told by legal advisors at\na nearby Air Force base that they should not pay debt consultation companies to\nnegotiate with their creditors. They were also advised to consider filing bankruptcy to\nresolve their debts. Applicant and her husband do not intend to file bankruptcy, stating\nthey intend to pay their debts. They have not yet reached any repayment or other\nsettlement agreements with their creditors. (Tr. 77 - 84)\nApplicant and her husband are active in the Civil Air Patrol as volunteer\ncommunications officers. They have been trained in search and rescue procedures, and\nare qualified under the Federal Emergency Management Agency\u2019s (FEMA) first\nresponder training program. References from Applicant\u2019s friends and former police\ndepartment co-workers show she enjoys a positive reputation in the community for\nintegrity and reliability. (Ax. A)\nPolicies\nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense\ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information,4\nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the Revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG). Decisions must also reflect consideration of the factors\nlisted in \u00b6 2(a) of the new guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nconcept, those factors are:\n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not\ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable\nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they\nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified\ninformation. In this case, the pleadings and the information presented by the parties\n\n See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n5\n See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n6\n See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).\n7\n5\nrequire consideration of the security concerns and adjudicative factors addressed under\nAG \u00b6 18 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations).\nA security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest  for an applicant to either receive or continue to\n5\nhave access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of\nproducing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision to deny or\nrevoke a security clearance for an applicant. Additionally, the government must be able\nto prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it\nthen falls to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case.\nBecause no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an applicant bears a heavy\nburden of persuasion.  \n6\nA person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the government\nhas a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment,\nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her\nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of\nany reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the\ngovernment.7\nAnalysis\nFinancial Considerations.\nThe security concern about Applicant\u2019s finances, as stated in AG \u00b6 18, is that \n[f]ailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nThe government presented sufficient information to support all but one of the\nallegations in SOR \u00b6 1. Because SOR 1.I is a duplicate of SOR 1.d, SOR 1.I is\nconcluded for the Applicant. Available information shows approximately $23,537 in\ndelinquent debt for 11 accounts attributable to Applicant since as far back as 2001.\nAvailable information shows Applicant has not paid or otherwise resolved any of the\ndebts in her credit history. A review of her current monthly cashflow after expenses\nsuggests she is unable to pay her debts outright. Accordingly, the record in this case\nrequires application of the disqualifying conditions listed at AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability or\n\n6\nunwillingness to satisfy debts) and AG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial\nobligations).\nAvailable information shows that the actual amount of debt attributable to\nApplicant is actually about $21,803. The debt at SOR \u00b6 1.a resulted from an insurance\nerror. The debt at SOR \u00b6 1.I, as noted above, is a duplicate, and the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6\n1.e - 1.g are from her mother-in-law\u2019s estate. Additionally, the credit card debt at \u00b6 1.k is\ncurrently about $12,149, but started as a $4,000 account that grew with interest and\ncollection fees over time. (Tr. 61) That debt constitutes more than half Applicant\u2019s total\ndebt. The remaining six debts average about $1,600 each.\nIn response, Applicant has demonstrated that her debts became delinquent\nprimarily through the 2003 failure of the small business she and her husband had\nowned since about 1997. That business failure was precipitated by her husband\u2019s health\nproblems that rendered him 100% disabled. Also contributing to their financial problems\nwas an 18-month delay in receipt of VA benefits. Once they received nearly $40,000\nfrom the VA in 2005, they brought their mortgage out of foreclosure and paid off\nbusiness and personal accounts. Since then, Applicant has taken little or no action to\nresolve her remaining debts. She claimed at hearing that she has contacted some of\nher creditors and that she has relied on legal advice to avoid debt consulting\ncompanies. However, she also did not heed legal advice to file bankruptcy and there is\nno corroborative information showing she has entered into any substantive negotiations\nwith any of her creditors or that she has sought other help in resolving her debts. Nor is\nthere any documentation of payments made, despite being allowed time for post-\nhearing submissions. Ax. E consisted solely of past tax records related to their small\nbusiness, but did not shed any additional light on efforts to repay the debts alleged in\nthe SOR.\nOf the Guideline F mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20, Applicant benefits from\nthe mitigating condition at AG \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so\ninfrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does\nnot cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment).\nApplicant and her husband have incurred no new delinquencies since they received\ntheir VA benefits. Their current finances are sound and they live well within their means.\nThe record also supports application of AG \u00b6 20(b)(the conditions that resulted in\nthe financial problem were largely beyond the person's control (e.g. loss of employment,\na business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances), which\ndirectly addresses Applicant\u2019s experience with a failed business and her husband\u2019s\nillness. The second prong of this adjudicative factor is supported by the fact Applicant\nand her husband used the money they received from the VA to settle what debts they\ncould. As already noted, their current finances are sound and they have not incurred\nnew delinquencies since 2005. On balance, I conclude Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties\nand the ongoing presence of unpaid debt are not likely to cause her to act illegally or in\nany way contrary to the national interest to generate funds to resolve her debts. The\nGuideline F security concerns are resolved for the Applicant.\n\n7\nWhole Person Concept. \nI have evaluated the facts presented and have applied the appropriate\nadjudicative factors under Guideline F. I have also reviewed the record before me in the\ncontext of the whole person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a). There has been no misconduct\nhere. Applicant is a mature adult who had to assume the role of primary income earner\nwhen her husband became disabled. She attempted unsuccessfully to salvage their\nbusiness in 2003, but found work as soon as she could to support them both. While she\nhas been unable to resolve their debts, she and her husband have not spent more than\nthey have; nor have they resorted to excessive use of their personal credit. The\ncircumstances that gave rise to her financial problems are not likely to recur or cause\nfurther delinquencies. \nPositive information about Applicant\u2019s character and reliability is sufficient to\nshow that the adverse information about her finances cannot be used as a means to\npressure or coerce her into acting contrary to the national interest. A fair and\ncommonsense evaluation of this record shows that the security concerns about\nApplicant\u2019s finances have been satisfied.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\n Subparagraph 1.a - 1.l:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to\ncontinue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance.

On February 12, 2009, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \ndetailing security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline \nE (Personal Conduct). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn March 21, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR in writing and elected to have \nthe case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. On March 31, 2009, \nMay 22, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \nDepartment Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM) containing nine \nItems, and mailed Applicant a complete copy the following day. Applicant received the \nFORM on April 22, 2009, and had 30 days from its receipt to file objections and submit \nadditional information. Applicant submitted a statement that I marked as Applicant \nExhibit (AE) 1 and admitted into the record. On May 1, 2009, DOHA assigned the case \nto me. \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the allegations contained in \nParagraph 1 of the SOR, except Paragraphs 1.j and 1.o. He admitted the allegations \ncontained in Paragraphs 2. b and 2.c, and seemingly denied those in Paragraph 2.a.   \n \n \nApplicant is 44 years old and unmarried. He has six children, ages 7 to 21. Since \nJune 1984, he has worked as a computer operator for a defense contractor. He \nobtained a Secret security clearance in January 1996. (Item 5) He noted in his April \n2009 statement that he does not presently have access to classified information. (AE 1) \n \n \nIn November 2007, Applicant completed an e-QIP. In response to Question 27(b) \nthat requests information about garnishments or repossessions, Applicant disclosed a \nJanuary 2003 garnishment for child support. He did not disclose an automobile \nrepossession. In response to Questions 28(a) and (b), which asked whether he had any \nfinancial debts more than 90 or 180 days delinquent, he answered \u201cNo,\u201d and did not \ndisclose eleven delinquent debts.  \n \n \nIn August 2008, Applicant completed a set of Interrogatories regarding delinquent \ndebts. (Item 6) Applicant submitted information about two garnishments for child support \nthat were entered by the court: one in June 2002 and one in September 2007, for two \nseparate children. The 2007 garnishment is for $840 per month. Applicant also \ncompleted a Personal Financial Statement. He earns approximately $59,000 annually. \nAfter paying the $840 garnishment and another $1,000 loan every month, his net \nmonthly income is $1,162. His expenses are about $2,000, leaving him with a monthly \ndeficit. (Item 6) \n \n \nIn responding to Questions 28(a) and (b) in the Interrogatories about his failure to \ndisclose delinquent debts, Applicant explained that \u201cMy finance situation the past six \nyears has no bearing on the job I have been doing for the past 24 years.\u201d (Item 6)  \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant again asserted that his financial situation did \nnot have relevance to his job performance. He noted, \u201cI have always safeguarded \nclassified information without any security infractions.\u201d (Item 4) He attributed his \nfinancial problems to the 2007 child support garnishment and noted that he could not \nget a second job because any additional income he might receive would raise his child \nsupport payments. (Id.) He admitted that he failed to disclose information regarding his \ndelinquent debts because he \u201cAnswered the questions quickly as I do not see why my \nsituation has anything to do with my performance at work.\u201d (Id.) \n\n \n3 \n \n \n  \nIn that Answer, Applicant explained why he did not disclose the repossession of \nhis automobile under Question 27 of the e-QIP. \u201cWhen my 1999 Chevy suburban was \nrepossessed I got it back the next day. When the transmission/transfer case stopped \nworking I gave the truck back to the dealership, as I could not afford to pay the car \npayments and the cost of the maintenance.\u201d Seemingly, he did not consider the return \nof his vehicle to be legal repossession.  \n \n \nBased on credit bureau reports (CBR) dated December 2008 and December \n2007, Paragraph 1 of the SOR alleges 14 delinquent debts, totaling $34,565, which \nbegan accruing in 2003. (Items 7 and 8) The debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.n for $9,127 \nshould be for $6,523, which is the amount of the judgment entered in the matter. (Item \n6) All of the debts are unresolved, including the $740 debt listed in SOR \u00b6 1.j that \nApplicant denied. Applicant did not present any evidence that he contacted any of \ncreditors or attempted to address the debts.  \n   \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d Section 7 of \nExecutive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  \n\n \n4 \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG & 19(a) an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying. \nSimilarly under AG & 19(c) Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise \nsecurity concerns. Based on two CBRs and his statements, Applicant has been unable \nor unwilling to satisfy debts that began accruing six years ago. The evidence is sufficient \nto raise these two potentially disqualifying conditions. \n \nAfter the Government raised potential disqualifications, the burden shifted to \nApplicant to rebut and prove mitigation. The guideline includes examples of conditions \nthat could mitigate security concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), \nthe disqualifying condition may be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, \nwas so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment.@ Applicant\u2019s multiple financial problems arose six years ago and continue to \nthe present. Because the problems are ongoing and not isolated, it is likely that that \nthey will continue in the future, and do cast doubt about his judgment. Hence, this \ncondition does not apply.   \n \nAG & 20(b) states that it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in \nthe financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of \nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce \n\n \n5 \n \n \nor separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ Applicant \ndid not offer any substantive evidence to support the application of this condition.  \n \nEvidence that \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control\u201d \nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Applicant did not present any evidence that \nhe received credit counseling and/or that his financial problems are under control, as \nrequired under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the evidence shows \nthat Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise \nresolve debts.@ He did not provide evidence that he paid, attempted to pay or is on a \nrepayment plan for any debt. AG & 20(d) does not apply. He denied one debt but did \nnot produce documentation indicating that he successfully disputed debt. Such \nevidence is necessary to trigger mitigation under AG & 20(e), which applies when \u201cthe \nindividual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is \nthe cause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of \nthe dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue.\u201d AG & 20(f) is not \napplicable to the facts in this case.    \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nThe security concern pertaining to the guideline for personal conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nThe Government alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a, 2.b and 2.c that Applicant falsified \nanswers to three questions on the SF-86; to wit, he failed to disclose an automobile \nrepossession and debts that were more than 90 and 180 delinquent. The Government \ncontended that those omissions may raise a security concern and be disqualifying. The \ndisqualifying condition alleged under AG \u00b6 16 in this case is: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \nApplicant disclosed a child support garnishment under Question 27(b), but apparently \ndid not consider his voluntary relinquishment to be a legal repossession. Based on his \nexplanation and the garnishment disclosure, I find that he did not intentionally withhold \ninformation about the repossession; hence, the Government did not establish a \n\n \n6 \n \n \ndisqualifying condition as to SOR \u00b6 2(a). Applicant admitted that he willfully did not \ndisclose any information about his delinquent debts because he did not think the \nGovernment had a right to know. The Government established disqualifications as to \nthe allegations set forth in SOR \u00b6 2(b) and \u00b6 2(c).   \nAG \u00b6 17 provides five conditions that could mitigate security concerns raised \nunder this guideline: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully. \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nAfter reviewing the above mitigating conditions, I find none of them are \napplicable. Applicant did not make any effort to promptly correct his omissions. He \nintentionally made a decision to withhold information based on his own belief. Although \nthe omissions occurred less than two years ago, he continues to assert the \nappropriateness of that decision in 2009. He has not acknowledged his wrongful \nconduct, nor demonstrated that he has taken steps to eliminate vulnerability to duress.   \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a). They include the following:  \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is 44 years old and has \nworked for his employer for almost 25 years, during which time he has held a security \nclearance for at least ten years. In August 2008, the Government sent him a set of \nInterrogatories, alerting him to the financial delinquencies that could adversely affect his \nsecurity clearance. In his response to the Interrogatories, he essentially said that the \ndelinquent debts should not be of concern to the Government based on his long history \nof successful employment. He also indicated that his financial problems are directly \nrelated to a court-ordered garnishment for child support, the second one levied against \nhis pay in less than ten years. In February 2009, he received the SOR, detailing the \nspecific debts in question and articulating concerns under the financial and personal \nconduct guidelines. In mid-April 2009, he received the FORM, notifying him that he had \nan additional 30 days to respond and submit documentary evidence. Despite having \napproximately eight months to address the Government\u2019s concerns, including his \ndeliberate decision to withhold requested information, he took no action. His failure to \nresponsibly respond to those concerns calls into question his judgment and reliability. \n    \nGiven his long employment history and previous experience with the security \nclearance process, it is troubling that he did not take any affirmative steps to address \nthe Government\u2019s specific concerns when he learned of them. Based on his tight budget \nand lack of proof that he has attempted to address the outstanding debts in some way, \nsimilar problems are likely to occur in the future.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his financial \nissues and personal conduct.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.o:   \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.c:                                   Against Applicant \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant\u2019s admissions in response to the SOR are admitted as fact. After a thorough review of the pleadings, Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, and the FORM, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is 49 years old and employed by a defense contractor. He and his former spouse have two daughters, 11 and 21 years old (Items 5 and 6) . According to his Security Clearance Application of May 2007, he worked at a series of correctional facilities from 1986 to 2003, holding positions as a Correctional Supervisor and Chief of Security. He was unemployed for six months in 2001 and two months in 2003 (Item 6). After his unemployment in 2003, he obtained a position as a Correctional Supervisor, which he held for three years.

Duffy, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nO\u2019BRIEN, Rita C., Administrative Judge:\nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I\nconclude that Applicant has mitigated the security concerns raised under the guideline\nfor financial considerations. Accordingly, his request for a security clearance is granted.\nOn May 21, 2007, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for\nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP SF-86) to request a security clearance required as\npart of his employment with a defense contractor (Item 5). After reviewing the results of\nthe ensuing background investigation, adjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings\nand Appeals (DOHA) were unable to make a preliminary affirmative finding  that it is\n1\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s request. \nDecember 8, 2008\n\n See Directive, Enclosure 3, Section E3.1.7. The FORM included eight documents (Items 1 - 8) proffered in\n2\nsupport of the government\u2019s case.\n Applicant did not indicate whether this figure represents his gross or net monthly income.\n3\n2\nOn August 15, 2008, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR),\nthat specified the basis for its decision \u2013 security concerns addressed in the Directive\nunder Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines\n(AG).\nApplicant received the SOR on August 19, 2008 (Item 3). He submitted a\nnotarized Answer, dated August 28, 2008 (Item 4), along with supporting\ndocumentation. In his Answer, he admitted to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.g., but neither\nadmitted nor denied SOR \u00b6 1.h. Applicant also requested a decision without a hearing. \nOn October 2, 2008, DOHA Department Counsel submitted a file of relevant\nmaterials (FORM)  in support of the government\u2019s preliminary decision. Applicant was\n2\ngiven 30 days to file a response to the FORM, but did not reply. The case was assigned\nto me on November 19, 2008. \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant\u2019s admissions in response to the SOR are admitted as fact. After a\nthorough review of the pleadings, Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, and the FORM, I\nmake the following additional findings of fact.\nApplicant is 49 years old and employed by a defense contractor. He and his\nformer spouse have two daughters, 11 and 21 years old (Items 5 and 6) . According to\nhis Security Clearance Application of May 2007, he worked at a series of correctional\nfacilities from 1986 to 2003, holding positions as a Correctional Supervisor and Chief of\nSecurity. He was unemployed for six months in 2001 and two months in 2003 (Item 6).\nAfter his unemployment in 2003, he obtained a position as a Correctional Supervisor,\nwhich he held for three years. He was hired by his current employer in June 2006 and\nsubmitted his Security Clearance Application approximately one year later (Item 5).\nApplicant\u2019s monthly income is $1,943, or about $23,300 annually (Item 6).  After\n3\npaying expenses of $1,819, he has of monthly net remainder of $124. In his Answer of\nAugust 2008, he states that his financial situation has improved, his house sale is to be\ncompleted in September, and he is now able to save $200 per month.\nThe SOR alleges seven debts that became delinquent between 2003 and 2008\n(Items 7 and 8), amounting to $37,195. One of Applicant\u2019s debts (unalleged) was\nrelated to a timeshare purchase from Bluegreen. It became delinquent after Applicant\u2019s\nwife did not make the scheduled payments, and failed to inform Applicant of her actions.\nApplicant decided to pay off this large debt using credit cards from Chase, Bank of\n\n Directive, \u00b6 6.3.\n4\n See, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n5\n3\nAmerica, Sears, and Discover (Item 6), which contributed to the overdue balances\nshown in allegations 1.b., 1.d., 1.f., and 1.g.\nApplicant provided documentation regarding the current status of each debt (Item\n4). Allegation 1.a., the debt to Network/Singing River, is for utilities in the house where\nhis former spouse lives. She has taken responsibility for the debt by setting up a\npayment plan with the creditor, but has made no payments to date (Item 4, A-1).\nApplicant paid the debt to Chase (allegation 1.b) in June 2007 (Item 4, B-1). The\naccounts with HSBC/Best Buy (allegation 1.c.) and Sears (allegation 1.f.) are closed.\nApplicant contacted the creditors, who informed him that the credit reporting agencies\nwill be instructed to delete the accounts from Applicant\u2019s credit reports (Item 4, C-1 and\nF-1, respectively). According to correspondence from West Asset Management, the\ncollection agency for Bank of America (Item 4, D-1), Applicant paid this debt (allegation\n1.d.) in July 2007. Applicant also provided evidence that he paid the debts owed to\nChevron (allegation 1.e.) and Discover (allegation 1.g.) (Item 4, E-1 and G-1,\nrespectively).\nPolicies\nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense\ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information,\nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the Revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG).  Decisions must also reflect consideration of the factors\n4\nlisted in \u00b6 2(a) of the Guidelines, commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept.\nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not\ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an Applicant. However, specific applicable\nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they\nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified\ninformation. In this case, the pleadings and the information presented by the parties\nrequire consideration of the security concerns and adjudicative factors addressed under\nGuideline F (financial considerations) at AG \u00b6 18.\nA security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest  for an Applicant to either receive or continue to\n5\nhave access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of\nproducing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision to deny or\nrevoke a security clearance for an Applicant. Additionally, the government must be able\nto prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it\nthen falls to the Applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case. \n\n See, Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n6\n See, Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).\n7\n This total does not include the Chase debt ($15,125) and the Bank of America debt ($5,500) which Applicant\n8\npaid in 2007, more than one year before the Statement of Reasons was issued (Item 4, B-1 and D-1).\n4\nBecause no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an Applicant bears a heavy\nburden of persuasion.  A person who has access to classified information enters into a\n6\nfiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the\ngovernment has a compelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the\nrequisite judgement, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national\ninterests as his or her own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard\ncompels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in\nfavor of the government.7\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nAG \u00b618 expresses the security concern pertaining to financial considerations:\nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially over-\nextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nCompulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes\nincluding espionage. Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources\nof income is also a security concern. It may indicate proceeds from\nfinancially profitable criminal acts.\nDisqualifying condition AG \u00b619a (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts)\napplies. Applicant was unemployed for six months in 2001. When he obtained\nemployment again, between 2001 and 2005, he was married and supporting a family of\nfour, apparently on a relatively low salary (Item 6). These factors contributed to\nApplicant\u2019s inability to pay his debts. AG \u00b619c (a history of not meeting financial\nobligations) also applies. Applicant\u2018s credit bureau reports show that he has had\nnumerous delinquencies over the past five years (Items 7 and 8). By August 2008,\nwhen the SOR was issued, Applicant owed a total of $16,570,  demonstrating a history\n8\nof failing to meet financial obligations. \nThe Financial Considerations guideline also contains factors that can mitigate\nsecurity concerns. Mitigating conditions AG \u00b6 20c and AG \u00b6 20d apply. \n\n5\nAlthough Applicant\u2019s credit report (Item 8) shows he is liable for the $730 owed to\nNetwork/Singing River (Item 4), he provided documentation that his former wife has\nassumed responsibility for the debt, contacted the creditor, and established a payment\nplan. The documentation indicates that as of August she had not started payments\n(Item 4). But even if she does not follow through, and Applicant is responsible for this\ndebt, the relatively small balance is insufficient to raise security concerns. The fact that\nonly this single debt remains unresolved indicates that Applicant\u2019s financial situation is\nunder control, supporting application of AG \u00b6 20c (the person has received or is\nreceiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem\nis being resolved or is under control).\nAG \u00b6 20d (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts) also applies because Applicant has not only made a good-faith\neffort to resolve his debts, but has in fact resolved six of the seven debts. He paid two\nsizable debts in 2007 (Bank of America and Chase). Payment of substantial debts more\nthan one year before the Statement of Reasons was issued shows that his efforts to\ndeal with his financial situation were not simply a response to the security clearance\nprocess, but a sincere effort to meet his financial obligations. Since then, he has paid\ntwo other debts (Chevron and Discover). He has also been assured by the two\nremaining creditors (HSBC/Best Buy and Sears) that his closed accounts will be\nremoved from his credit reports. \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate the\nApplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s conduct and\nall the circumstances. I have evaluated the facts presented and have applied the\nappropriate adjudicative factors under the cited Guideline. I have also reviewed the\nrecord before me in the context of the whole-person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and\nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;\n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nApplicant accrued significant debt over the past several years. His financial\nproblems resulted from a combination of events\u2013unemployment, a spouse who did not\ninform him of her failure to make payments, and a poor decision to pay a large debt with\ncredit cards. However, he paid two large debts more than one year ago, so that when\nthe SOR was issued in 2008, he owed less than half the amount of delinquencies\nalleged. Moreover, in response to the government\u2019s concerns about his remaining\ndelinquencies, he provided documentation showing that he has resolved all but one of\nthe debts. Applicant\u2019s documented efforts over the past year have demonstrated a\n\n6\nsincere effort to meet his financial obligations and have been successful. Indebtedness\nis no longer a security concern. A fair and common-sense assessment of the available\ninformation bearing on Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance shows he has\nsatisfied the doubts about his ability or willingness to protect the government\u2019s interests.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are as follows:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor  Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to\nallow Applicant access to classified information. Applicant\u2019s request for a security\nclearance is granted.\n                             \nRITA C. O\u2019BRIEN\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On October 22, 2008, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant \ndetailing security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The action \nwas taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on November 27, 2008, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. On December 4, 2008, DOHA assigned the \ncase to me. A Notice of Hearing was issued December 16, 2008, and the case was \nFebruary 10, 2009\n\n \n \n \n \n2\nheard on January 13, 2009, as scheduled. Department Counsel offered Exhibits (GE) 1 \nthrough 6 into evidence without objection. Applicant testified and offered Exhibits (AE) A \nthrough E into evidence without objection. At the conclusion of the hearing, I left the \nrecord open until January 23, 2009, to give Applicant an opportunity to submit additional \ninformation. Applicant timely submitted four exhibits that were marked AE F through I \nand admitted into the record without objection by the Government. On January 26, \n2009, DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.)  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the debts contained in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \nthrough 1.j, but denied that they were not being addressed.  \n \n \nApplicant is 26 years old and unmarried. After graduating from high school in \nJune 2000, he enlisted in the U.S. Navy. He served the next five and a half years on a \nnaval ship, as an information system specialist. He was deployed to the Persian Gulf \nthree times, for eight month stints. He received enlisted evaluations that recommended \nhe be promoted early throughout his naval career and held a secret and interim Top \nSecret clearance. At one point, he had 17 people working for him. In March 2006, he \nreceived an Other than Honorable Discharge for using marijuana in January 2006. He \nwas an E-5 at the time, earning about $42,000 annually.1 (GE 1 at 29; Tr. 36) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial difficulties began occurring after he left the Navy. Upon his \ndischarge, he was required to repay a $16,000 bonus he had received from the \nDepartment of Defense (DoD) for reenlisting, which monies he did not have. From \nMarch 2006 until November 2007, he worked about eight months, on and off, and was \nunemployed the rest of the time, until he obtained his current position. He went from \n$42,000 per year to no income for almost two years. (Tr. 98) Although he managed to \nstay current with all of his financial obligations while in the Navy, he could no longer pay \nhis debts, which included two automobile loans and three credit cards. As the debts \nstarted accruing large interest costs, his total indebtedness began to rise. (Tr. 82-84) At \na certain point, he decided to move in with his parents to avoid filing bankruptcy. (Tr. 61)  \n \n \nIn November 2007, Applicant started working for a federal contractor, having \ncompleted an e-QIP in October 2007. In that e-QIP, he disclosed the debts he knew had \nbecome delinquent. During a subsequent interview with a governmental investigator, he \nwas informed of others. (Tr. 43) He then obtained a credit bureau report (CBR) for the \nfirst time, and learned of the magnitude of his debts. (Tr. 103) In December 2007, he \ncontacted a debt consolidation company. On December 15, 2007, he made an initial \n$750 payment on a plan to resolve 11 debts, totaling $28,601. (AE B at 2-3) Under the \nterms of the agreement, he will continue to pay $600 per month into a trust account \ntoward the balance of the accounts while the company pays off the debts after it \nrenegotiates the accounts. To-date, he has paid $8,700 to the company, which settled a \n$5,447 debt for $3,264 owed to a creditor, not listed on the SOR. He has accrued \n                                            \n1The Government did not raise any security concerns under Drug Abuse or Criminal Conduct.  \n\n \n \n \n \n3\n$1,838 in the trust account that will be used to resolve and pay additional accounts. \nAccording to the plan, all of his debts will be resolved by July 2010. He will have paid \nabout $20,000 to resolve approximately $28,601 of delinquent debt.2 (AE B)    \n \n \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant has 10 delinquent debts, totaling $20,497, all of \nwhich are included in the repayment plan he established in December 2007.3 The status \nof the 10 delinquent debts is as follows: \n \n1. The debt in SOR \u00b6 1. a $1,984 debt is owed to a credit card company. It is \nincluded in the repayment plan and is listed as No. 10. (AE B at 2; Tr. 53).   \n \n2. The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b for $1,999 debt is owed on a defaulted car loan. It is \nincluded as Nos. 8 and 9 on the repayment plan. (AE B at 2; Tr. 56) \n \n3. The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c for $1,381 debt is included as No. 9 on the repayment \nplan. (AE B at 2) \n \n4. The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d for $33 is included in the repayment plan and is listed \nas No. 7. (AE B at 2; Tr. 57) \n \n5. The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e for $210 debt was paid in full on July 17, 2008, for \n$223. (AE E: 6/26/07-7/25/08 Bank Statement; Tr. 58) \n \n6. The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f for $1,690 debt owed to a credit card company for a \nlaptop computer is included in the repayment plan as No. 1. (AE B at 2; Tr. \n58)  \n \n7.  The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.g for $3,220 is owed to a credit card company and  is \nincluded in the repayment plan as No. 6. (AE B at 2; Tr. 58) \n \n8.  The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.h for $4,559 is included in the repayment plan as No. 2. \n(AE B at 2; Tr. 59)  \n \n9. The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.i for $3,368 is owed on an automobile loan is included in \nthe repayment plan as No. 11.  (AE B at 2; Tr. 59)  \n \n10.  The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.j for $2,053 is  included in the repayment plan as No. 5. \n(AE B at 2; Tr. 59)  \n \n \nIn addition to resolving the above 10 debts, Applicant repaid $3,200 of the \n$16,000 debt owed to DoD with the help of a $4,800 loan from his parents. (Tr. 52) As \n                                            \n2 This amount is the total of the payments Applicant has made and will make as listed on the \nrepayment plan under the Transaction columns.(AE B) It appears that a large portion of Applicant\u2019s \npayments are going to the company as settlement fees. (AE D)  \n3The plan includes 11 delinquent debts, one of which is not listed in the SOR, but is listed as No. \n4 in the repayment plan. \n\n \n \n \n \n4\nof the hearing date, he reduced that balance to $10,500 and $1,011 to his parents.4 He \nsubmitted a revised budget that lists his net monthly income as $2,883. His monthly \nliving expenses are $1,238. He spends $1,100 a month on his debt reduction plan, \nwhich consists of $600 to the debt consolidation company, $400 to DoD, and $100 to \nhis parents, for a total of $1,100. He has a net remainder of $545. (AE C at 2) He is also \nputting 6% of his paycheck in a 401(k). (Tr. 66) He has recently paid a $544 delinquent \ndebt that was not listed on the SOR, but does appear on the October 2008 credit \nbureau report. (Tr. 73) He no longer uses credit cards. (Tr. 100) \n \n \n \nApplicant provided a copy of a letter, dated September 27, 2008, documenting an \nincrease in his pay for good performance. (AE A) He submitted a copy of the recent \nperformance evaluation, leading to that increase, which gives him a rating of 3.7 out of \n5.0. (AE I) Applicant\u2019s section manager submitted a letter of recommendation in which \nhe complimented Applicant for his work and efforts. The manager stated that Applicant \nis \u201cdependable, reliable, comes to work on time and is never late. I can trust [Applicant] \nto make the best decision possible for this section. I would hate to lose a good hard \nworking employee like [Applicant].\u201d (AE F) The section leader of Applicant\u2019s team is \naware of Applicant\u2019s financial problems and the steps he has taken to resolve them. He \nhighly recommends him, writing: \u201c[Applicant] has shown me that he is willing to learn, \nreliable, dedicated, motivated and honest.\u201d (AE G) A colleague of Applicant, who has \nworked with him since November 2007, has also assisted him in resolving his debts. He \nstated, \u201cI find [Applicant] to be extremely trustworthy and devoted to his job and the \nideals of a safe and secure nation.\u201d (AE H)  \n \n \nDuring his testimony, Applicant honestly acknowledged his debts. He candidly \nexplained how they occurred and the steps he has taken to resolve them. With help \nfrom his parents, he has learned to manage his finances more responsibly and maintain \nhis budget. He uses an accounting software program to monitor his finances. He is \nadamantly opposed to using credit cards. He received several hours of credit \ncounseling before he was discharged from the Navy in March 2006.   \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n                                            \n4Neither of these debts is included in the SOR and will not be considered in an analysis of \ndisqualifying conditions, but will be considered in the whole person analysis.  \n\n \n \n \n \n5\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, The applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d Section 7 of \nExecutive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \n\n \n \n \n \n6\nThe guideline notes two conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \npotentially applicable in this case. Under AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201can inability or unwillingness to \nsatisfy debts\u201d is potentially disqualifying. Similarly, under AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not \nmeeting financial obligations\u201d may raise security concerns. Applicant began \naccumulating a significant amount of delinquent debt after he left the Navy in March \n2006 that he could not pay until he began his current position in November 2007. The \nevidence is sufficient to raise these disqualifications. \n \nAfter the Government produced substantial evidence of those disqualifications, \nthe burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove a mitigating condition. \nAG \u00b6 20 includes six conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising from \nfinancial difficulties: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income. \nApplicant=s financial delinquencies arose two years ago, in 2006, and continued \ninto December 2007, when he began addressing them.  Because the problems are \nrecent and not isolated, his previous judgment is called into question and AG \u00b6 20(a) \ncannot apply.  \n \nApplicant accumulated debts after he was discharged from the Navy and was \nunable to obtain full-time employment for almost two years. His inability to find a decent \njob for a period of time was a circumstance beyond his control. Because he did not \n\n \n \n \n \n7\npresent evidence indicating that he attempted to manage his debts while unemployed, \nAG \u00b6 20(b) has limited application.  \n \nAfter learning of the extent of his financial problems from the Government in the \nfall of 2007, Applicant entered into a repayment plan in December 2007 to resolve all of \nhis outstanding debts. To-date, he has paid one SOR debt and deposited about $8,700 \nwith a company that is resolving his other delinquent debts. He produced evidence that \nhe has paid in full one debt for $544, not included in the SOR. He received credit \ncounseling from the Navy in 2006 and advice from his parents. Based on his budget, \nwhich includes a workable repayment plan, his finances are under control, as a result of \nhis good-faith efforts to resolve or pay his debts. Hence, AG \u00b6 20(c) and AG \u00b6 20(d) \nhave some application \n \nThere is no evidence to support the application of AG \u00b6 20(e) and AG \u00b6 20(f).   \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a). They include the following:  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must include an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a 26-year-old unmarried \nman, who served in the Navy for five and a half years before being administratively \ndischarged in March 2006. Prior to that discharge, he was building an impressive naval \ncareer and earning a good salary before being discharged due to his misconduct. After \nbeing discharged from the Navy, he was unemployed for almost two years resulting in \nthe accumulation of about $40,000 of debt, including $16,000 owed to the DoD for a \nreenlistment bonus that he did not fulfill, and $4,800 to his parents. After reviewing his \ncredit reports with the Government in early fall of 2007, he promptly entered into a \nrepayment plan in December 2007, to resolve and pay his obligations. While the terms \nof that agreement appear to favor the company, Applicant\u2019s decision to immediately \n\n \n \n \n \n8\naddress his issues demonstrated responsible financial judgment. At this time, he has \nreduced the DoD debt to $10,500 and loan from his parents to $1,100. He paid other \ndebts through the plan that were not listed in the SOR. He has contributed about $8,700 \nto his debt reduction program. According to the terms of that agreement, he anticipates \nhaving the debts paid by July 2010. Over the course of the last year or more, Applicant \nappears to have matured and has credibly expressed his commitment to achieving \nfinancial solvency. \n \nApplicant\u2019s manager, team leader and colleague, are aware of his financial \nproblems, diminishing any potential for financial exploitation. All of them recommend \nhim for a security clearance. His first year\u2019s performance evaluation notes a higher than \naverage rating. He is dedicated to his job and his co-workers confirm his honesty and \ndedication.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of the above \nreasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising under financial \nconsiderations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.j: \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n                                           \n     \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nSHARI DAM \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Benson, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nHOWE, Philip S., Administrative Judge: \n \nOn September 18, 2007, Applicant submitted his Security Clearance Application \n(SF 86). On September 22, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under \nGuideline F. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on September 29, 2008, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed \non October 21, 2008, and I received the case assignment on October 23, 2008.  DOHA \nissued a Notice of Hearing on January 21, 2009, and I convened the hearing as \nscheduled on February 3, 2009. The Government offered Exhibits 1 through 5, which \nwere received without objection. Applicant testified and submitted Exhibits A through C, \n \n1 \n \n \nApril 16, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \nwithout objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on February 11, \n2009. I granted Applicant\u2019s request to keep the record open until February 17, 2009, to \nsubmit additional matters, including a plan to repay his delinquent debts (Tr. 94-96).  \nApplicant did not submit any plan or documents by that date. The record closed on \nFebruary 17, 2009. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and \ntestimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \nNotice \n \nAt the hearing, I advised Applicant of his right under \u00b6 E3.1.8 of the Directive to \n15 days notice before the hearing. Applicant affirmatively waived his right to 15 days \nnotice. (Tr. 8)  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated September 22, 2008, Applicant admitted the \nfactual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a to 1.d, 1.f, 1.k to 1.m, 1.p, and 1.q of the SOR, with \nexplanations. He denied the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 1.g to 1.j, 1.n, and 1.o of the \nSOR. He also provided additional information to support his request for eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.   \n \n \nApplicant is 37 years old, married for 13 years, and has three pre-teenaged \nchildren.  He is employed by a defense contractor as a network administrator.  He does \nnot have a security clearance at the present time.  He had a clearance from 1990 to \n1996 when he served in the Navy.  He seeks a clearance now because he has an \nopportunity to be the Information Systems Security Manager (ISSM) for his employer.  \nHe earns about $74,000 annually in his job, which is the highest income he has had \nsince leaving the Navy in 1996. (Tr. 22-32; Exhibit 1) \n \n \nApplicant bought a house in October 2007 for $173,000, with no down payment \nunder the Veterans Administration Home Mortgage Program, and recently refinanced it \nto reduce his monthly mortgage payments from $1,528 monthly to $1,350. The $5,000 \nof expenses for the refinancing was included in his mortgage balance on this 30 year \nmortgage. His monthly expenses total $1,715, plus the $1,350 for the house mortgage, \nand $568 for a car payment.  Applicant bought his wife a used 2006 Mercury \nMountaineer in 2007 for about $22,000 at 18% interest, resulting in the $568 monthly \ncar payments.  Applicant and his wife also have student loans, on which they pay about \n$226 monthly.  His wife does not work outside the home. Applicant\u2019s net monthly \nincome is about $4,000.  He has about $200 remaining at the end of each month, a \nchange from the negative $96 loss shown on his Personal Financial Statement in 2008.  \nIn 2008 he received an income tax refund of $3,000 which he spent on family expenses.  \nIn 2009 he expects to receive about a $6,000 income tax refund, which he claims he will \nuse to repay some of the delinquent debts listed in the SOR.  Applicant was given two \nweeks after the hearing to submit proof of payments to creditors, and a repayment plan \n\n \n3 \n \n \nfor the remaining unresolved debts.  He did not submit any documentation. (Tr. 20, 33-\n37, 62-64, 82, 89-100; Exhibit 5)  \n \n \nApplicant filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 1999 on about $30,000 worth of credit \ncard debt.  He was discharged in bankruptcy in January 2000.  Those debts resulted \nfrom a former fianc\u00e9e\u2019s access to Applicant\u2019s accounts while he was deployed on naval \nduty in the 1990s.  She spent his money and incurred debts he could not pay, so he \nfiled the bankruptcy. (Tr. 28, 37; Exhibits 1-5, A-C)  \n \n \nApplicant had one month of unemployment in 1999.  He had three months of \nunemployment in 2005. His final period of unemployment was for a little more than a \nmonth from November 2006 to mid-January 2007. (Tr. 28, 38, 41) \n \n \nApplicant has a savings account presently, but no money is in it.  All his income \nis deposited into his checking account.  He has a debit card, and no credit cards.  He \nclaims to have a household budget, but did not submit a copy of it at the hearing, nor \ndid he detail the contents of the budget. (Tr. 64, 66, 67) \n \n \nApplicant has 15 delinquent debts unresolved.  Those debts total $62,602.  He \nhas no repayment plan to resolve the debts.  He has made no payments to those \ncreditors for the past four years.  He has not filed disputes in writing against any of \nthese debts. (Tr. 38-72; Exhibits 1-5, A-C) \n \n \nThe unresolved delinquent debts are as follows: \n \n \n1. A department store credit card balance for $568 (Subparagraph 1.b).  The last \npayment was made in August 2006.  Applicant claims he forgot about it. (Tr. 38-43; \nExhibits 1-5, A-C) \n \n \n2. A credit card debt for $3,038 (Subparagraph 1.c).  Applicant took out this card \nin 2002. (Tr. 43; Exhibits 1-5, A-C) \n \n \n \n3. $607 owed on a credit card (Subparagraph 1.d).  Applicant claims this debt \nresulted from fraud, but did not file disputes with the credit reporting agencies. (Tr. 44, \n71, 72; Exhibits 1-5, A-C) \n \n \n4. Applicant owes $7,112 on a credit card (Subparagraph 1.e).  Applicant claims \nit is a duplicate listing for the next debt listed in Subparagraph 1.f, but has no \ndocumentation to support his assertion.   Applicant is not making payments on this debt. \nHe claims he could pay $150 monthly; however the creditor wants $500 monthly. (Tr. \n45; Exhibits 1-5, A-C) \n \n \n5. A debt on a credit card for $5,669 (Subparagraph 1.f).  This debt is shown as \ncharged off on Exhibit A and continues to be owed. (Tr. 45; Exhibits 1-5, A-C) \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \n6. Applicant owes $8 and $87 to the city of his former residence for parking \ntickets owed on cars he claims he sold, but the new owner did not change the \nregistration ownership (Subparagraphs 1.g and 1.h).  Applicant claims he resolved \nthese debts with the city, but has no documentation to support his position.  He has not \ndisputed the debts with the credit reporting agencies. (Tr. 47; Exhibits 1-5, A-C) \n \n \n7. Applicant owes $71 and $1,674 to a creditor for medical treatments \n(Subparagraphs 1.i and 1.j).  He claims they were paid by his insurance company, but \nhas no documentation to validate his contention.  They continue on his credit reports. \n(Tr. 48, 68; Exhibits 1-5, A-C) \n \n \n8. Applicant owes three debts to a credit union.  Two debts are for cars \nrepossessed in 2005 when he lost his job for three months.  The first debt is for $16,682 \n(Subparagraph 1.k) and Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B shows the debt currently as $17,482.  The \nsecond debt is for $19,753 (Subparagraph 1.l) and currently is $21,672.  The third debt \nwas for a personal loan of $5,000 (Subparagraph 1.m) taken out to start a small \nbusiness.  The balance owed as shown on the SOR is $5,081, and on Applicant\u2019s \nExhibit B is $6,126. No payments have been made on any of these debts.  The \nrepossessed autos were a 2002 Mercury Mountaineer and a 1996 BMW.  Applicant \nclaims he could afford the autos while he was working and earning $65,000 annually.  \nHe attempted to arrange a repayment amount, but the creditor wanted $900 a month, \nwhich he could not pay. (Tr. 50-55, 80; Exhibits 1-5, A-C) \n \n \n \n9. Applicant owes $1,557 on a telephone bill (Subparagraph 1.n).  He claims he \ndoes not owe this money, but has documentary proof to support that position.  He has \nnot paid any money on this debt.  His credit report in Exhibit B shows this debt was \nverified in July 2007. (Tr. 56, 73; Exhibits 1-5, A-C) \n \n \n10. Applicant owes a creditor $466 (Subparagraph 1.o).  He claims this debt is \nthe same as the next debt owed on a department store credit card for $503 \n(Subparagraph 1.p).  He has not paid anything on the $466 debt, and last made any \npayment on the $503 in 2005. (Tr. 57-60, 76; Exhibits 1-5, A-C)  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s lack of any efforts to resolve these delinquent debts in the past four \nyears, and his failure to submit any plan or proof of payments of these 15 debts, \ndiminish his credibility.  His presentation was not persuasive when his apparent desire \nto submit a plan, expressed at the end of the hearing, is compared to his lack of action \nto send such a plan when given the opportunity to do so.  Applicant used his $3,000 \nincome tax refund in 2008 to pay other expenses, not those of greater age as listed in \nthe SOR.  His assertion that he will use his $6,000 tax refund in 2009 to repay debts is \nnot credible in view of his history of debt non-payment. (Tr. 89-100) \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration \nof the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  \nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise \nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated substantial delinquent debt of over $62,000 in \neight years after declaring bankruptcy in 2000 on $30,000.  He is unable and unwilling \nto pay these obligations for the past four years, and particularly the past two years when \nhe has been earning a good income.  Also, AG \u00b6 19 (e), \u201cconsistent spending beyond \none's means, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative \ncash flow, high debt-to-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis,\u201d is exemplified by \nApplicant\u2019s current debt being twice the amount discharged in the 1999 bankruptcy.  \nApplicant\u2019s large current debt results in large part from his purchasing two autos he \ncould barely afford in 2004, which were later repossessed during a short period of \nunemployment, and borrowing $5,000 from the same credit union and not repaying it. \nThe evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties.  An examination of the evidence in the case \nas applied to these mitigating conditions results in the following analysis. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition may be mitigated where Athe \nbehavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s delinquent debt arose \nafter 2000 when he was discharged in bankruptcy.  The debt is current, and shows a \nrepeated pattern by Applicant incurring debt and not taking any action to repay it.  The \nevidence does not raise this potentially mitigating condition.  \n \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the \nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a \nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), \nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ Applicant\u2019s \n\n \n7 \n \n \nunemployment periods were short and not the cause of his debt problems.  He simply \nspends too much money, and does not manage his income properly.  He did not act \nresponsibly in identifying and resolving these debts. I find this potentially mitigating \ncondition is not a factor for consideration in this case.  \n \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@ \nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c).  There is no evidence that Applicant received \nany counseling.  Nor is there any evidence that his debt problem is under control.  This \nmitigating condition is not applicable to the disqualifying conditions.  \n \nSimilarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the evidence shows Athe individual initiated a \ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant has \nnot repaid any debt listed in the SOR or made any good-faith effort to resolve his \ndelinquent debt. I conclude this potentially mitigating condition does not apply. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 20 (e) if \u201cthe individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the \nlegitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of \nactions to resolve the issue,\u201d then the mitigating condition would apply.  Here, Applicant \nhas no reasonable basis to dispute these debts.  He admitted eight of these debts, and \ndenies seven of them. He never articulated any reasonable basis to dispute any of \nthese debts.  This mitigating condition does not apply.  \n \nFinally, AG \u00b6 20 (f) pertains to affluence resulting from a legitimate source.  \nThere is no evidence of any affluence being a factor in this Applicant\u2019s case.  Therefore, \nthis mitigating condition is not applicable. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 2(c) requires each case must be judged on its own merits.  Under AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \n\n \n8 \n \n \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. When these problems first began, \nApplicant was a mature married man, father of three children, who had already declared \nChapter 7 bankruptcy. His accumulation of double the debt that was discharged in his \n1999 bankruptcy displays, quite clearly, Applicant\u2019s continued inability to manage his \nfinances reasonably.  His delinquent debt situation has recurred, and his lack of action \nto date on resolving these debts shows there is a continuing problem.  Because of his \nlack of resolving action, they are a source of potential coercion, duress, pressure, and \nexploitation.   \n \nApplicant has not exhibited any behavioral changes regarding his financial \ndecisions and situation.  He accepted my offer of additional time to prepare a plan and \nrepay some debts as part of that plan, but never submitted anything on a resolution \nprogram.  He again revealed his lack of interest in resolving his debts. For example, \nApplicant owes one credit union about $43,000 on car repossessions and a personal \nloan.  These debts alone would be sufficient to demonstrate that Applicant lacks \nintegrity and good judgment, and is untrustworthy, regarding his financial decisions.  He \npresents a record of borrowing money or incurring financial obligations, and then \nignoring his legal and moral duty to repay the money. Those actions are unacceptable \nand a repeat the financial irresponsibility he exhibited in the 1990s. \n \n Of course, the issue is not simply whether all his debts are paidBit is whether his \nfinancial circumstances raise concerns about his fitness to hold a security clearance. \nHis cavalier attitude toward his delinquent debts and duty to repay them weighs heavily \nagainst him in this analysis.  His credibility on the issue of his debts is non-existent. All \nhis debts listed in the SOR remain unpaid and they are amply sufficient to raise security \nconcerns.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant did not mitigate the security concerns arising from his financial considerations.  \nI conclude the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept against Applicant. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.q:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nPHILIP S. HOWE \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Nagel, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nJuly 30, 2009\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLOKEY ANDERSON, Darlene D., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted her Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP) dated January 6, 2008.  (Government Exhibit 1).  On October 24, 2008, the\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865\n(as amended), and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January\n2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed the\nreasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the\nDirective that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for the Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative\nJudge to determine whether a clearance should be denied or revoked.\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on November 7, 2008, and requested a\nhearing before an Administrative Judge.  The case was originally assigned to another\nAdministrative Judge on April 16, 2009.  The matter was transferred to the undersigned\nAdministrative Judge on June 8, 2009.  A notice of hearing was issued on June 8, 2009,\nscheduling the hearing for June 26, 2009.  At the hearing, the Government offered five\nexhibits, referred to as Government Exhibits 1 through 5, which were received without\nobjection. Applicant offered twenty exhibits, referred to Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A through T,\nwhich were admitted into evidence without objection.  She also testified on her own\nbehalf.  The record remained open until close of business on July 10, 2009, to allow the\nApplicant the opportunity to submit additional documentation.  The Applicant submitted\n\n2\nthree Post-Hearing Exhibits, referred to as Post-Hearing Exhibits A through C which\nwere admitted without objection.  The transcript of the hearing (Tr.) was received on\nJuly 7, 2009.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony,\neligibility for access to classified information is granted.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe following Findings of Fact are based on the Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR,\nher testimony and the exhibits.  The Applicant is 35 years old and has a Bachelor\u2019s\nDegree in Business and is half way through her Master\u2019s program.  She is employed by\na defense contractor as a Senior Engineering Project Specialist and is seeking to obtain\na security clearance in connection with her employment.  \nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the\nbasis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  After a complete and\nthorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the same,\nthe following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the\nSOR:\nParagraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations)  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for a security clearance because she is financially overextended\nand at risk to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe Applicant was married in 1997, at the age of twenty-three.  After twelve\nyears in an ill fated marriage that involved her husband\u2019s inability to hold a job for any\nsignificant length of time, and her efforts to stay in the marriage only for the sake of her\nchildren, she and her husband separated last year.  The Applicant immediately hired an\nattorney and got sole physical and legal custody of their three children.  In April 2009,\nthe Applicant filed for divorce.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit R).  Since their separation, the\nApplicant has received no financial support of any kind from her husband.  (Tr. p. 43).\nSince November 2007, the Applicant been employed in the defense industry.  \nThe Applicant realized that she and her husband incurred debt during the\nmarriage, but was shocked to learn the extent of their indebtedness when she received\nthe SOR.  Most of the credit outlined in the SOR was incurred in her husband\u2019s name,\nand she was a co-signer on the accounts.  In addition to the necessities they\npurchased, her husband also purchased lavish electronic toys for the children that he\nplayed with.  Her husband had assured her that he was paying the bills, while she was\nattending college.  After separating, her soon to be ex-husband handed her a folder\ncontaining numerous letters from collection agencies that the Applicant had not been\naware of.  Since then, she has been working hard to resolve her delinquent debts.  \nAlthough at least half of the debt incurred during the course of her marriage is\nher husband\u2019s financial responsibility, the Applicant has tried to pay most of it off on her\nown.  Only five of the fourteen debts set forth in the SOR remain owing.  The following\ndebts have been paid in full.  A debt owed to a bank that has been charged off in the\namount of $943.00 has been paid.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B).  A debt owed to a creditor in\nthe amount of $2,394.00 has been paid.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit C).  A debt owed to a\n\n3\ncreditor in the amount of $1,646.00 has been paid.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit D).  A debt\nowed to a creditor in the amount of $309.00 has been paid.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit E).  A\ndebt owed to a creditor in the amount of $1,667.00 has been paid.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit\nF).  A debt owed to a creditor in the amount of $1,010.00 has been paid.  (Applicant\u2019s\nExhibit G).  A debt owed to a creditor in the amount of $5,824.00 has been paid.\n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit H).  A debt owed to a creditor in the amount of $141.00 has been\npaid.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit I).  A debt owed to a medical provider in the amount of\n$5,976.00 has been paid.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit J).    \nThe following debts remain outstanding.  A debt owed to a bank in the amount of\n$3,888.00 remains outstanding.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A).  The Applicant explained that\nthe debt was her husband\u2019s and she had hoped that the divorce decree would make\nhim responsible to pay it.  However, if it does not, she  intends to pay it.  A debt owed to\na creditor in the amount of $608.00 remains outstanding.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit K).  She\nexplained that she has had difficulty locating the creditor, but plans on paying the debt\nas soon as she knows who to pay.  (Tr. pp. 45 - 46).  A debt owed to a creditor in the\namount of $850.00 remains outstanding.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit L).  She has also been\nunable to locate this creditor.  A debt owed to a bank in the amount of $1,200.00\nremains outstanding.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit M).  Applicant plans to pay all of her debts as\nsoon as possible.    \nLetters of recommendation from the Applicant\u2019s present and past supervisors,\nand other business associates, including a business development manager, the field\nsecurity officer, and a  program manager attest to her reliability and trustworthiness with\nthe highest moral character.  She is said to have always been security conscious and\nhas accessed classified information in an exemplary manner.   (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit S\nand Post-Hearing Exhibit A).  \nApplicant\u2019s performance review for 2008 and her mid year review for 2009 reflect\nthat she has met and accomplished each and every one of the expectations of her job\ndescription.  (Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibits B and C).    \nApplicant used her income tax refund to pay her delinquent debts.  She is current\nwith all of her monthly expenses and uses whatever is left over at the end of the month\ntoward her delinquent debts.  She intends to continue paying her delinquent debts until\nthey are completely resolved.  She understands the responsibilities that come with\nholding a security clearance and protecting the national interests at all times.  She\nunderstands that she must always live within her means and pay her bills in a timely\nfashion.  \nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies divided into \"Disqualifying\nFactors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying Factors and Mitigating\nFactors are found to be applicable in this case:\n\n4\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations)\n18.  The Concern.  Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to\nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  An individual who\nis financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes including\nespionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a\nsecurity concern.  It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n19(a)  inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;\n19(c)  a history of not meeting financial obligations.\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n20(b)  the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond\nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected\nmedical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted\nresponsibly under the circumstances;\n20(c)  the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or\nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control;\n20(d)  the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\na.  The nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding\ncircumstances\nb.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation\nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne.  The extent to which participation is voluntary\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavior\nchanges\n\n5\ng.  The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\n \ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\nan acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted\nupon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative\nprocess is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person\nconcept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable\nand unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions\nbased on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order\n. . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned.\u201d\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn the defense industry, a security clearance is entrusted to civilian workers who\nmust be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information twenty-four hours per\nday, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore appropriately concerned when\navailable information indicates that an Applicant for such access may be involved in\ninstances of financial irresponsibility which demonstrates poor judgment or unreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the\nholding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then\nshifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation\nwhich is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The Applicant\nbears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant her a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the\nApplicant has been financially irresponsible (Guideline F).  This evidence indicates poor\njudgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.  Because of\nthe scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude there is a nexus or\nconnection with her security clearance eligibility.\n\n6\nUnder the particular circumstances of this case, I find that the Applicant has\nmade a good faith effort to resolve her debts.  Her financial problems were caused by\ncircumstances largely beyond her control, namely her ill fated marriage that involved her\nhusbands inability to keep a job, and his failure to pay their bills on time.  There is also\nevidence of the fact that at times, they were spending beyond their means.  However,\nupon being made aware of the extent of her indebtedness, she has made tremendous\nprogress in resolving her debts.  She has completely paid off nine of the fourteen debts\nset forth in the SOR.  She plans to resolve the remaining debts as soon as possible.\nShe understands the responsibilities that come along with holding a security clearance.\nShe also understands that holding a DoD security clearance is a privilege and that she\nmust continue to demonstrate financial responsibility at all times.  She should no longer\nhave any problems paying her bills on time as she understands the importance of living\nwithin one\u2019s means.  In the event that she has any future financial problems, her\nsecurity clearance will immediately be in jeopardy.  Considering all of the evidence, the\nApplicant has introduced persuasive evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation that\nis sufficient to overcome the Government's case.  \nThere is evidence of financial rehabilitation at this time.  Under Guideline F\n(Financial Considerations), Disqualifying Conditions 19(a) inability or unwillingness to\nsatisfy debts, and 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations apply.  However,\n20(b)  the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the\nperson\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical\nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly\nunder the circumstances;\n20(c)  the person has received or is receiving counseling for\nthe problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control, and 20(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue\ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts also applies.  The Applicant had initiated a good\nfaith effort to repay her overdue creditors or otherwise resolve her debts.  Accordingly, I\nfind for the Applicant under Guideline F (Financial Considerations).  \nI have also considered the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d in evaluating the Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.  Under the particular facts of this case, the\ntotality of the conduct set forth above, when viewed under all of the guidelines as a\nwhole, support a whole person assessment of good judgement, trustworthiness,\nreliability, candor, a willingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other\ncharacteristics indicating that the person may properly safeguard classified information.\nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has overcome the Government's\ncase opposing her request for a security clearance.  Accordingly, the evidence supports\na finding for the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary allegations expressed in\nParagraph 1 of the Government's Statement of Reasons.     \n\n7\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: For the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.b.:\nFor the Applicant.\n                                    Subpara.  1.c.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.d.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.e.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.f.:\nFor the Applicant.\n                                    Subpara.  1.g.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.h.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.i.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.j.:\nFor the Applicant.\n                                    Subpara.  1.k.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.l.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.m.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.n.:\nFor the Applicant.\n                                   \nDECISION\nIn light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interests to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant.\n  Darlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Applicant\nrequested the case be decided on the written record.  On April 24, 2009, after considering the record,\nAdministrative Judge Noreen A. Lynch denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nApplicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raises the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  For the following reasons, the Board affirms the Judge\u2019s unfavorable\ndecision. \nApplicant states that (i) she is not a threat to national security and would not jeopardize\nherself, her family, her business and her country in any way; (ii) her debts are mostly attributable to\nmarital abuse, a medical issue, and fraud; (iii) she is currently making payments on collection items,\nhas paid some of them off, and a few other debts listed on her credit report have been paid off.\nApplicant\u2019s assertions do not demonstrate error on the part of the Judge.\nSome of Applicant\u2019s assertions on appeal make reference to matters taking place after the\nclose of the record.  These matters constitute new evidence, which the Board cannot consider.\nDirective, \u00b6 E3.1.29.\nThe presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a\nfavorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a\nwhole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.\nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-10320 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 7, 2007).  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with\nthe Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the\nevidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in\na manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3\n(App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007).  \n   \nIn this case, the Judge found that Applicant had a lengthy and serious history of not meeting\nfinancial obligations.  The Judge also found that at the time of the close of the record, Applicant still\nhad substantial delinquent debts in an aggregate amount of over $14,000, and had not presented\nevidence of payments to creditors or the establishment of valid repayment plans.  These findings are\nsupported by the record evidence.  In light of the foregoing, the Judge could reasonably conclude that\nApplicant\u2019s financial problems were still ongoing.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-07747 at 2 (App.\nBd. Jul.3, 2007).  The Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the length\nand seriousness of the disqualifying conduct and considered the possible application of relevant\nmitigating conditions and whole-person factors.  She found that Mitigating Condition \u00b6 20(e)1\napplied to the case, but only affected two of Applicant\u2019s outstanding debts.  The Judge  reasonably\nexplained why the evidence which Applicant had presented in mitigation was insufficient to\n\n3\novercome the government\u2019s security concerns.  The Board does not review a case de novo.  After\nreviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant evidence and\narticulated a satisfactory explanation for her decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the\nfacts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfs.

Duffy, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLYNCH, Noreen A., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted her Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on January 9,\n2008. On December 3, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline F\nfor Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on December 8, 2008, and elected\nto have her case decided on the record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel\nsubmitted the Government\u2019s written case on January 9, 2009.  Applicant received a\n1\ncomplete file of relevant material (FORM) on February 2, 2009, and was provided the\nApril 24, 2009\n\n2\nopportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the\nGovernment\u2019s case. Applicant did not submit additional information. The case was\nassigned to me on April 16, 2009. Based upon a review of the case file, eligibility for\naccess to classified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nIn her Answer to the SOR, dated December 24, 2008, Applicant admitted the\nfactual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.n, 1.r-1.u, 1.w, 1,y-1.cc, 1.ff, and 1.jj, of the SOR (Item 4).\nShe denied the remaining allegations. She did not provide additional information to\nsupport her request for eligibility for a security clearance. \nApplicant is a 25-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She graduated from\nhigh school in June 2001. She has never held a security clearance (Item 4). She\nmarried in 2001 and divorced in 2003. She remarried in 2005 and has one child (Item\n5). She has been employed with her current employer since December 2006.\nApplicant worked in a variety of positions but reported a period of unemployment\nfrom June 2005 until December 2006. Applicant was unemployed during the time of her\nfirst marriage according to her security clearance application (Item 5).   \nThe SOR alleges 36 delinquent debts, including a 2003 judgment, totaling\napproximately $24,203 (Items 7 and 8). The accounts were charged-off or in collection\nfrom approximately 2003. The delinquent debts are confirmed by her credit reports\n(Items 7, 8).\nApplicant admitted to 25 delinquent accounts alleged in the SOR totaling\napproximately $14,439. She claimed the debts alleged in \u00b6\u00b6 1.t and 1.ff are the same\ndebt and are the result of a divorce and job loss. She did not provide documentation to\nsupport this statement. However, the accounts are duplicates according to account\nnumbers on the credit reports.\nWhen Applicant answered the SOR, although she denied certain allegations, she\nalso acknowledged that some credit card accounts were in her name during her\nmarriage (1.q, 1.r, 1.s, 1.u, 1.v,) but she did not present any plan for payment or\nresolution of the debts.\nApplicant denied allegations 1.p and 1.ii because the credit cards were opened,\nwithout her permission, by her ex-husband. She did not provide any information to\nsupport this claim.\nApplicant claimed that she was unaware of the 2003 judgment (1.a) until a\ngarnishment occurred. She did not provide any information on the garnishment. \nIn her statement dated November 12, 2008, (included with her interrogatories)\nshe stated that most of the bills are due to \u201cspouse abuse\u201d. She explained that she has\n\n3\ndisputed most of the medical bills because her insurance should have covered the\ncharges incurred (Item 6). \nShe also explained that she is making payments to Asset Acceptance for the\nHSBC debt and also to the USAA Bank (1.t). She claimed a Navy Exchange bill is paid.\nShe did not provide any documentation for any payments.\nApplicant\u2019s answer to the SOR does not include any documentation of payment\nfor any of the accounts she admits are her responsibility. She listed an entry on her\npersonal financial statement for payment of $60 a month toward HSBC and USAA but\nshe submitted no documentation to support the claims.\nApplicant denied the other allegations in the SOR because \u201cshe did not recall the\naccount\u201d. Applicant did not provide any information in response to the FORM. There is\nscant evidence in the record.\nThe current status of Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts is as follows: the collection\ndebts, charged off accounts and judgment from late 2003 until the present are\ndelinquent and not paid. Applicant did not report receiving financial counseling. She did\nnot provide any documentation to support her position concerning the debts alleged or\npayments to the accounts.\nApplicant\u2019s current net monthly income is $4,756. This includes her spouse\u2019s\nincome. She reported monthly expenses of $3,522 on her personal financial statement.\nHer net monthly remainder is listed as $1,114.14 (Item 6).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2,\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\n\n4\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated delinquent debts on numerous accounts\ntotaling approximately $24,203 over a period of approximately six years. She admitted\n\n5\nto 25 delinquent debts totaling $14,439. Her credit reports confirm her debts. The\nevidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant still\nhas significant delinquent debts from 2003. She has not acted responsibly. She has\nprovided no record of any payments. Her conduct over the last six months with her\ncreditors does not remove security concerns or doubts about her current reliability,\ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. This mitigating condition does not apply. \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ As noted above,\nApplicant reported two periods of unemployment. She did not provide any explanation\nas to how this impacted her ability to pay her debts. She attributes the majority of the\ndelinquent debt to \u201cspouse abuse\u201d. She did not provide any information that she acted\nresponsibly in identifying and resolving these debts, including the medical bills. I find this\nmitigating condition does not apply. \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the\nevidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant has not received counseling. She provided little or\nno information. Her assertions in her answer to the SOR that she is paying on two debts\ndoes not constitute evidence of financial reform or resolution of debts. No evidence was\npresented to show payments to any creditors or the establishment of valid repayment\nplans. Her efforts are not sufficient to carry her burden in this case. I conclude these\nmitigating conditions do not apply.\nAG \u00b6 20(e) applies where the evidence shows \u201cthe individual has a reasonable\nbasis to dispute the legitimacy of the past due debt which is the cause of the problem\nand provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.\u201d In this case, Applicant disputed the majority of\nthe medical debts because her insurance should have covered the charges but did not\nprovide documented proof to substantiate her claim. The debts alleged in 1.t and 1.ff\nare duplicates according to the credit report. This mitigating condition applies to those\ntwo debts but does not apply to the remaining debts.\n\n6\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a security clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon\ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant reports that the majority of\nthe debts are accounts in her name that occurred during her marriage. She has not\nprovided any evidence to show attempts to resolve these debts. She disputed medical\ndebts. However, she has not provided any documentation to support the claim that her\ninsurance was liable for the amounts. The record contains scant information concerning\nApplicant. She chose to have her case decided on the written record. She did not\nsubmit additional information after receiving the FORM.

Duffy, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nLOUGHRAN, Edward W., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant has not mitigated the Financial Considerations security concerns. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n \nOn October 22, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing the security concerns \nunder Guideline F, Financial Considerations. The action was taken under Executive \nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), \nas amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.  \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in an undated written response, and elected to \nhave the case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel \nsubmitted the government\u2019s written case on December 30, 2008. A complete copy of \nthe file of relevant material (FORM) was provided to Applicant, who was afforded an \nFebruary 17, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \nopportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the \nsecurity concerns. Applicant received the FORM on January 5, 2009. He responded \nwith an undated letter and six documents. Department Counsel did not object to his \nresponse. The case was assigned to me on February 10, 2009.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 26-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has a Bachelor \nof Science degree. He is married. He stated in October 2008 that his wife was pregnant \nand expected to give birth in about four months.1  \n \n \nThe SOR alleges four delinquent debts totaling $11,493. The SOR also alleges \nthat Applicant\u2019s personal financial statement reflects a negative net monthly remainder \nof $362. Applicant admitted all the allegations, with the exception of the $685 debt \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d, which he stated was paid. He also provided additional information \nto support his request for eligibility for a security clearance. \n \n \nApplicant attended college between 2001 and 2006. He worked while attending \nschool, but his income was barely enough to meet his living expenses. His current \nfinancial situation remains problematic. He provided financial data to an investigator \nfrom the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) in October 2007. After accounting for \nhis income, expenses, and debts, he had $362 more going out in debts and expenses \nthan he had income. His father periodically assisted him financially with the shortfalls.2 \nApplicant\u2019s negative cash flow is alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e. Applicant responded to DOHA \ninterrogatories in October 2008. He stated: \n \nI would like to state that I am incapable [of making] payment plans for the \ndebts mentioned in the report. My responsibilities have greatly increased \nsince the date of the interview. I became married and my wife and I are \ncurrently expecting a child in about four months. Since she\u2019s unemployed \n[and] uninsured, I am therefore responsible for all maternity expenses and \nall associated expenses thereafter.3 \n \n \nIn addition to his delinquent debts and other expenses, Applicant\u2019s credit reports \nalso show at least $60,000 in student loans. The student loans are not listed as \ndelinquent. He pays $74 per month on one loan with a balance of about $21,000. The \nremaining student loans are in deferment, but they will need to be addressed eventually. \nHe has not received financial counseling.4  \n \n                                                          \n1 Items 5, 7. \n \n2 Id. \n \n3 Item 7. \n \n4 Items 6-9. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant submitted sufficient documentation to establish that the $685 debt, \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a, was actually a $259 debt. This debt was paid in July 2008.5 \n \n \nApplicant admitted owing a delinquent debt of $434 to a medical provider, as \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b. He sustained injuries requiring medical treatment when his car \nwas struck by another vehicle. He sued the other party and was awarded a judgment. \nThe other party did not have insurance, and Applicant has apparently not been able to \ncollect on the judgment. He told the OPM investigator in October 2007 that he would \ncall the collection company within a month to establish a payment plan. The debt \nremains unpaid.6 \n \n \nApplicant co-signed a car loan with his girlfriend in about 2003. She did not earn \nenough money to make the payments, and he was unable to pick up the payments after \nshe stopped paying on the loan. The car was repossessed in about 2004. Applicant \nadmits he owes the deficiency balance of $8,542, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c.7  \n \n \nApplicant was the victim of a con artist in 2006. He subscribed to an internet web \nsite to find a roommate. He received an e-mail from a woman in Africa stating that she \nwould like to be his roommate. She sent him two checks for $800. She asked him for \n$800 back, so that she could move her belongings to the United States. He cashed the \nchecks at his bank and sent her $800. The bank notified him that the checks were not \nvalid. The bank attempted to debit the $1,600 from his account, but he had a negative \nbalance. The bank asked Applicant to repay the money. He told the bank that he was \nthe victim of fraud, but the bank still wanted the money. Applicant told the OPM \ninvestigator in October 2007 that the balance due on the account was $1,832. He stated \nthat he would contact the collection company handling the debt within six months to \nestablish a monthly payment schedule. He has made no payments on this debt, which \nis alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d.8  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \n                                                          \n5 Items 4, 8; Applicant\u2019s response to FORM. \n \n6 Items 4-9. \n \n7 Id. \n \n8 Items 4-7. \n \n\n \n4 \n \nover-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \n\n \n5 \n \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline lists several conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \n\u00b6 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;  \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(d) consistent spending beyond one\u2019s means, which may be indicated by \nexcessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-to-\nincome ratio, and/or other financial analysis. \n \n \nApplicant accumulated a number of delinquent debts and was unable or unwilling \nto pay his obligations for a period of time. He continues to have a negative monthly cash \nflow. The evidence is sufficient to raise all of the above potentially disqualifying \nconditions.  \n \n  \nFour mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)-(d) are potentially applicable in this \ncase:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nApplicant has not made payments on most of the debts alleged in the SOR. His \nfinancial problems are recent and ongoing. AG \u00b6 20(a) is not applicable.  \n \n \nApplicant attributes his debts to being a student and not earning enough money. \nHe also had an explanation for each debt. The medical debt resulted from a car \naccident that was not his fault. The car was repossessed because his girlfriend did not \npay the monthly payments. However, he co-signed for the car loan, which meant that he \nguaranteed the loan. He stated that he was the victim of an internet scam. He received \n\n \n6 \n \n$1,600 from the bank. If he had properly analyzed the situation, he would have realized \nthat it did not make sense to turn around and send the woman $800. Even accepting \nApplicant\u2019s explanation for this debt, he made $800 on the deal. The bank gave him \n$1,600, and he only paid the woman $800. He should have, at a minimum, paid the \nbank back the $800. He did not. I find that the conditions that resulted in his financial \nproblems were only partly beyond his control. To be fully applicable, AG \u00b6 20(b) also \nrequires that the individual act responsibly under the circumstances. Other than $259 \nfor the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a, Applicant has made no payments on any of his debts. \nHe did not act responsibly under the circumstances. AG \u00b6 20(b) is not applicable.   \n \nApplicant has not received financial counseling. He has delinquent debts and has \na negative cash flow each month. There are no clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control. AG \u00b6 20(c) is not applicable. One payment of $259 \ndoes not constitute a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve \ndebts. AG \u00b6 20(d) is not applicable.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \n     \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has more than $10,000 in \ndelinquent debt. He has more expenses than he has monthly income. With the large \namount of student loans looming, there is little chance that Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems will be resolved in the foreseeable future. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the Financial Considerations security concerns.  \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.b-1.e: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

The\nApplicant states, \u201cI was riding with a friend home from a social gathering when [our]\nvehicle was stopped by the police. During the sobriety test that my friend was\nundergoing I exited the vehicle and was charged with public intoxication. It was early in\nthe morning hours and the place was not very public.\u201d (Item 9 at 4.)\n1.e.  The Applicant was charged with Battery and Criminal Recklessness\nconcerning an incident in March 2001. The Information shows that the Applicant struck\nthe victim, lacerating his face. In addition, the Applicant also backed his vehicle in a\nreckless manner, nearly striking the victim. He plead guilty to Battery and was\n\nThe record also shows that the Applicant was arrested for Battery with Bodily Injury in December 1999.\n1\nAccording to the Applicant, he was involved in a bar fight. He paid restitution and the charges were dropped.\n(Item 9 at 4.) This incident is not alleged in the SOR.\nThe record shows that the Applicant answered \u201cNo\u201d to Section 25 in his Questionnaire (Item 4). This question\n2\nasks, \u201cIn the last 7 years, has your use of alcoholic beverages (such as liquor, beer, wine) resulted in any\nalcohol-related treatment or counseling (such as for alcohol abuse or alcoholism)?\u201d This possible falsification\nis not alleged in the SOR.\n3\nsentenced to 180 days in jail, suspended, ordered to pay a fine, and placed on\nsupervised probation. (Item 6 at 1-10.)1\n1.f. and 2.c.  The Applicant was arrested a year later, March 2002, for Battery\nResulting in Bodily Injury, Resisting/Interfering With Police Officer and Disorderly\nConduct. He plead guilty to the Battery charge and was sentenced to 365 days in jail,\nsuspended, ordered to pay a fine and placed on supervised probation.\nThe police report for this arrest shows that the Applicant was involved in a bar\nfight with another patron. An on-duty police officer attempted to stop the fight and was\nattacked by the Applicant, who punched the officer in the face, injuring him. The\nApplicant continued to behave in a violent and belligerent manner even after being\nsubdued and handcuffed by the police. He was drinking at the time of this incident.\n(Item 6 at 11-21.)\n1.g.  The Applicant was next charged with a Probation Violation of his 2001\nconviction and sentence (1.e.). This occurred three days after the arrest in 1.f. The\nrecord is unclear whether the Probation Violation was for that incident, but the Applicant\nadmitted to the violation in open court. (Item 6 at 4, 10.)\n1.h. and 2.d.  The Applicant\u2019s last arrest occurred in July 2006. He was arrested\nfor Alcohol Consumption in a Public Place. He paid a fine for this arrest. (Item 8.)\nConcerning this arrest, the Applicant states that he was walking down the street\nwithout a shirt or shoes on and must have looked suspicious. This was after a fight with\nhis mother in law. (Item 5 at 4.) The police report indicates that the Applicant was in a\nloud verbal dispute with another person, in the middle of the street, when the police\narrived and he was arrested. (Item 8 at 1.)\nRegarding his drinking, the Applicant has stated in 2007, that he continued to\ndrink 6 to 12 beers during the day every other weekend. (Item 5 at 3.) There is no more\nrecent information in the record.  The Applicant does admit that he went to an alcohol\nabuse program in 2002. However, there is no further information about the program in\nthe record.2\nParagraph 3 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct)\nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for\nclearance because he has made false statements to the Government during the\n\n4\nclearance screening process.  The Applicant denied the single allegation under this\nguideline.\n3.a. The Applicant filled out an e-QIP on June 18, 2007 (Item 4).  In that\nQuestionnaire the Applicant was required to answer Section 23.d., which asked, \u201cHave\nyou ever been charged with or convicted of any offense(s) related to alcohol or drugs?\u201d\nHe answered this question by setting forth his arrest for Possession of Marijuana in\n1997, as well as his two arrests for Battery in 2001 and 2002. He did not admit his DUI\narrest in 1997, his two arrests for Public Intoxication in 1999 and 2006, or his Probation\nViolation in 2001.  \nThe Applicant denies falsifying this answer, stating in his Answer, \u201cI\nmisunderstood the need to list offenses longer than seven years in the past, but thought\nthat illegal drug offenses were required.\u201d  (Item 3 at 1.)\nThis argument is undercut, however, by an incident involving the Applicant in\n2002. (Item 9 and Item 10.) He was employed by the Defense Department at that time\nand was dismissed from his job, in part, for falsifying Section 23.d. on and earlier\nQuestionnaire. Regarding that failure he stated in 2002, \u201cI had waited until the last\nminute to fill out the paperwork and was in a hurry. I did not read over the questions as\ncarefully as I should have.\u201d (Item 9 at 5.) This is direct evidence that the Applicant knew,\nor should have known, that his alcohol related arrests were required to be listed. \nIn addition, as stated under footnote 2, above, there is at least one other possible\nfalsification of an answer on his most recent Questionnaire. The Applicant has no\ncredibility regarding this issue. I find that his falsification of Section 23.d. on his\nQuestionnaire was deliberate.\nPolicies\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  When evaluating an\napplicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the administrative judge must consider\nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for\neach guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and\nmitigating conditions, which are considered as appropriate in evaluating an applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.  In addition, the administrative judge may also rely on his own\n\n5\ncommon sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature, and the ways of the\nworld, in making a reasoned decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Security clearance decisions include, by necessity, consideration\nof the possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nFinally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Section 7 of Executive Order\n10865, \u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the\nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nParagraph 1 (Guideline J \u2013 Criminal Conduct)\nParagraph 2 (Guideline G - Alcohol Consumption)\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in\nAG \u00b6 30:\nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness.  By its very nature, it calls into question a\nperson\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\n\n6\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Alcohol Consumption is set out\nin AG \u00b6 21:      \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of\nquestionable judgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.\nThe Applicant has been involved in eight criminal incidents between 1996 and\n2006.  Of those, five were alcohol related incidents. The Applicant continued to use\nalcohol up to 2007, after stating he had treatment in 2002. In addition, the Applicant was\ninvolved in three acts of battery, two of which were alleged in the SOR. One of the acts\nof battery, in 2002, involved the Applicant assaulting and injuring a police officer.\nUnder the Criminal Conduct guideline, the following Disqualifying Conditions are\napplicable.  AG \u00b6 31.(a) \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses.\u201d AG \u00b6 31.(c)\n\u201callegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was\nformally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted.\u201d\nAfter considering the evidence in the record, I find that the arguably applicable\nMitigating Conditions under Criminal Conduct do not apply to this case. AG \u00b6 32.(a),\nstates it may be mitigating where, \u201cso much time has elapsed since the criminal\nbehavior happened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely\nto recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness or good\njudgment.\u201d In addition, AG \u00b6 32.(d) states that it can be mitigating where, \u201cthere is\nevidence of successful rehabilitation, including but not limited to the passage of time\nwithout recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher\neducation, good employment record, or constructive community involvement.\u201d  \nWhile it has been three years since his last arrest, the Applicant has a long\nrecord of excessive drinking with criminal consequences. In addition, several of his\ncriminal incidents, under the influence of alcohol or not, involve violence. As further\ndescribed below, the Applicant is not a trustworthy reporter of the facts concerning his\nlife. Under the particular circumstances of this case, I cannot find that the Applicant has\nmitigated the security concerns of his criminal conduct.\nTurning to Guideline G, there are two Disqualifying Conditions concerning\nAlcohol Consumption that apply to this case.  AG \u00b6 22.(a) \u201calcohol-related incidents\naway from work, such as driving while under the influence, fighting, child or spouse\nabuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of whether the\nindividual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent.\u201d  In addition, AG \u00b6\n22.(c) applies, \u201chabitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired\njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or\nalcohol dependent.\u201d   \nAfter considering the evidence in the record, I find that the Mitigating Conditions\nunder Alcohol Consumption do not apply to this case.  AG \u00b6 23.(a) states that it can be\na mitigating condition when, \u201cso much time has passed, or the behavior was so\n\n7\ninfrequent, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\nor does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness or good\njudgment.\u201d  AG \u00b6 23.(b) states that it can be mitigating where, \u201cthe individual\nacknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol abuse, provides evidence of\nactions taken to overcome this problem, and has established a pattern of abstinence (if\nalcohol dependent) or responsible use (if an alcohol abuser).\u201d\nAs stated above, even though the Applicant\u2019s last alcohol related arrest was\nthree years ago, he continues to drink alcohol. There is no evidence to show that his\nexcessive drinking has stopped. His conduct by definition does not show reliability,\ntrustworthiness or good judgment.\nThe Applicant has not mitigated the security significance of his criminal conduct\nand, where alleged, related alcohol consumption.  Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the SOR are\nfound against the Applicant.\nParagraph 3 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct)\nThe Applicant admitted in his Questionnaire his drug-related arrests.  He argues\nthat his failure to list the alcohol offenses, even the most recent one, was an innocent\noversight. This argument is overcome by the Applicant\u2019s prior falsification of a\nGovernment Questionnaire, and related falsifications on this one, concerning his alcohol\nhistory. It is obvious that the Applicant is not a trustworthy reporter of the facts\nconcerning his own life.\nDisqualifying Condition AG \u00b6 16(a) applies to this case, concerning the\n\u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel\nsecurity questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct\ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities.\u201d None of the Mitigating Conditions apply to this case. Paragraph 3 is\nfound against the Applicant.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances.  Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of\nwhether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense\njudgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person\nconcept. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine adjudicative process\nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\n\n8\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and\nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;\n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  The Applicant has had five alcohol\nrelated arrests in 10 years.  He has had a total of eight criminal incidents. The acts are\nfrequent and recent.  He continues to drink alcohol in a way that shows a pattern of\nalcohol dependence and/or alcohol abuse.  In addition, he falsified a Government\nQuestionnaire concerning his alcohol use and criminal history. In viewing all the facts of\nthis case, I find that the Applicant has not mitigated the security significance of his prior\nconduct.  As set forth at length above, I find that the that there have not been\npermanent behavioral changes under AG \u00b6 2(a)(6); and that the likelihood of\ncontinuation or recurrence is very high (AG \u00b6 2(a)(9)). \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude the Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his criminal\nconduct, his alcohol-related incidents, and his personal conduct involving falsification of\na Government Questionnaire.  \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has not successfully overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing his request for a DoD security clearance.  Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\nallegations expressed in Paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of the Government's Statement of\nReasons. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nAGAINST THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst the Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst the Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h.\nAgainst the Applicant\n\n9\nParagraph 2, Guideline G:\nAGAINST THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nAgainst the Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.c:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.d:\nAgainst the Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:\nAGAINST THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a:\nAgainst the Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Applicant is a 48-year-old single college graduate who has been employed as a computer engineer and programmer for a defense contractor since February 2007. Prior to this employment, he worked as a software engineer for a computer company for sixteen years (Item 4).

Applicant was the psychiatrist's patient for over five years. The psychiatrist started seeing Applicant in September 1998 in the context of attention deficit disorder and related conditions. The psychiatrist noted in response to security investigator's questions that Applicant \"Yes, absolutely yes\" had a condition that could impair safeguarding of classified national security information.

The \ne-QIP was resubmitted and signed by Applicant on March 24, 2009 (Item 4). On April \n22, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline I for psychological \nconditions (Item 1). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised Adjudicative \nGuidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.   \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on May 6, 2009. He denied the SOR \nallegation under Guideline I, and elected to have the matter decided on the written \nrecord in lieu of a hearing (Item 3). Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s \nwritten case on June 2, 2009. Applicant received a complete file of relevant material \n(FORM), and was provided the opportunity to file objections and submit material to \nJuly 29, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \nrefute, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. Applicant timely responded on June \n29, 2009, providing additional information to refute, extenuate, and mitigate the security \nconcerns under Guideline I. The case was assigned to me on July 15, 2009. Based \nupon a review of the case file and the pleadings, eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \n \nAdministrative Notice \n \n \nI have taken administrative notice of the following information from the Diagnostic \nand Statistical Manual of Mental Health Disorders, DSM-IV-TR.  \n \nSchizotypal Personality Disorder is described as follows: \n \nThe essential feature of Schizotypal Personality Disorder is a pervasive \npattern of social and interpersonal deficits marked by acute discomfort \nwith, and reduced capacity for, close relationships as well as cognitive or \nperceptual distortions and eccentricities of behavior. The pattern begins by \nearly adulthood and is present in a variety of contexts. \n \nIndividuals with Schizotypal Personality Disorders often have ideas of \nreference (i.e., incorrect interpretations of casual incidents and external \nevents as having a particular and unusual meaning specifically for the \nperson. . .) These individuals may be superstitious or preoccupied with \nparanormal phenomena that are outside the norms of their subculture. \n \nIndividuals with this disorder are often suspicious and may have paranoid \nideations. They are usually not able to negotiate the full range of affects \nand interpersonal cuing required for successful relationships and thus \noften appear to interact with others in an inappropriate, stiff, or constricted \nfashion. These individuals are often considered to be odd or eccentric \nbecause of unusual mannerisms, an often unkempt manner of dress that \ndoes not quite \"fit together,\" and inattention to the usual social \nconventions (e.g., the person may avoid eye contact, wear clothes that are \nink stained or ill-fitting, and unable to join in the give-and-take banter of \nco-workers.) \n \nIndividuals \nwith \nSchizotypal \nDisorders \nexperience \ninterpersonal \nrelatedness as problematic and are uncomfortable relating to other \npeople. \n \n \nThe diagnostic criteria for Shizotypal Personality Disorder are: \n \nA pervasive pattern of social and interpersonal deficits marked by acute \ndiscomfort with, and reduced capacity for, close relationships as well as by \ncognitive or perceptual distortions and eccentricities of behavior, \nbeginning by early adulthood and present in a variety of contexts, as \nindicated by five (or more) of the following: \n\n \n3 \n \n(1) ideas of reference (excluding delusions of reference) \n(2) odd beliefs or magical thinking that influences behavior and is \ninconsistent with sub cultural norms (e.g., superstitiousness, belief in \nclairvoyance, telepathy, or \"sixth sense\" \n(3) unusual perceptual experiences, including bodily illusions \n(4) odd thinking and speech \n(5) suspiciousness or paranoid ideation \n(6) inappropriate or constricted affect \n(7) behavior or appearance that is odd, eccentric, or peculiar \n(8) lack of close friends or confidants other than first-degree relatives \n(9) excessive social anxiety that does not diminish with familiarity and \ntends to be associated with paranoid fears rather than negative \njudgments about self (Paragraph 301.22, page 697). \n \nSchizoid Personality Disorder is described as follows: \n \nThe essential feature of Schizoid Personality Disorder is a pervasive \npattern of detachment from social relationships and a restricted range of \nexpression of emotions in interpersonal settings. The pattern begins by \nearly adulthood and is present in a variety of contexts.   \n \nIndividuals with Schizoid Personality Disorders appear to lack a desire for \nintimacy, seem indifferent to opportunities to develop close relationships, \nand do not seem to derive much satisfaction from being part of family or \nother social group. They prefer spending time by themselves, rather than \nbeing with other people. They often appear to be socially isolated or \n\"loners\" and almost always choose solitary activities or hobbies that do not \ninclude interaction with others. They prefer mechanical or abstract tasks, \nsuch as computer or mathematical games. \n \nIndividuals with Schizoid Personality Disorder often seem indifferent to the \napproval or criticism of others and do not appear to be bothered by what \nothers may think of them. They may be oblivious to the normal subtleties \nof social interaction and often do not respond appropriately to social cues \nso that they seem socially inept or superficial and self-absorbed. \n \nSchizoid Personality Disorder may be first apparent in childhood and \nadolescence with solitariness, poor peer relationships, and under \nachievement in school, which mark these children or adolescents as \ndifferent and make them subject to teasing. \n \nThe diagnostic criteria for Schizoid Personality Disorder are: \n \nA pervasive pattern of detachment from social relationships and a \nrestricted range of expression of emotions in interpersonal settings, \nbeginning by early adulthood and present in a variety of contexts, as \nindicted by four (or more) of the following: \n\n \n4 \n \n(1) neither desires nor enjoys close relationships, including being part of a \nfamily \n(2) almost always chooses solitary activities \n(3) has little, if any, interest in having sexual experiences with another \nperson \n(4) takes pleasure in few, if any, activities \n(5) lacks close friends or confidents other than first-degree relatives \n(6) appears indifferent to the praise or criticism of others \n(7) shows emotional coldness, detachment, or flattened affectivity \n(Paragraph 301.20, page 694). \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant denied the factual allegation under Guideline I. I thoroughly and \ncarefully reviewed the case file and the pleadings. I make the following findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is a 48-year-old single college graduate who has been employed as a \ncomputer engineer and programmer for a defense contractor since February 2007. Prior \nto this employment, he worked as a software engineer for a computer company for \nsixteen years (Item 4).   \n \n \nApplicant in his e-QIP (Item 4) responded to a question concerning consultation \nwith a mental health professional, that he consulted with a psychiatrist from September \n1998 until May 2003. Applicant provided a release for his medical records with his e-\nQIP. Security investigators discussed Applicant's mental health condition with the \npsychiatrist and obtained his clinical records.  \n \n \nApplicant was the psychiatrist's patient for over five years. The psychiatrist \nstarted seeing Applicant in September 1998 in the context of attention deficit disorder \nand related conditions. The psychiatrist noted in response to security investigator's \nquestions that Applicant \"Yes, absolutely yes\" had a condition that could impair \nsafeguarding of classified national security information. He further indicated the \nApplicant's prognosis for substantial improvement was very poor. The psychiatrist \nopined (Item 5): \n \n[Applicant] is one of the most peculiar individuals I have come across in 30 \nyear of practicing medicine. He possesses all sorts of warning indicators \nthat he should not have a security clearance above or even at the level of \nthe average citizen. A psychological professional who did psychometric \ntesting on him about ten years ago, indicated to me that [Applicant] had \nsome scaled scores at \"psychotic levels.\" In addition, [Applicant] is \nobsessive-compulsive, forgetful, disorganized, prone to misplaced or \nlosing materials, sleepy, tardy, messy, inattentive, procrastinative, and \nprone to outbursts of temper. In addition, when I saw him, he complained \nof having periods of hearing \"dropout\" which I cannot rule out as brief \nperiods of psychosis. When I knew him, he had sleep apnea and was \ntherefore significantly prone to sudden death. \n\n \n5 \n \n[Applicant] has Schizotypal Personality Disorder and characteristics of \nSchizoid Personality Disorder. [Applicant] has lifelong odd beliefs and \nmagical thinking which influence his behavior. He has bizarre fantasies \nand frequent quite peculiar preoccupations, some of which go on for \nyears. The borderline of reality and abnormality, the borderline of this \nworld and the \"other world,\" is vague and indistinct to him. For example, \n[Applicant] believes in \"ground devils\" which are imaginary intelligent \nbiped animals living underground, perhaps somewhat like trolls, which \ncreatures he believes do attempt to contact human beings at times. He \nbelieves in Element 168 \"a yet undiscovered heavy metallic inert gas.\" He \nis infatuated with the house on the TV show \"Bewitched,\" the musical key \nof D minor, and the symbol in the hand of the jack of spades, Circle-K food \nstores, the number 26, Don Knotts, toilets, and the \"blue tail fly.\"  \n \nIf in government service, it would be very difficult to determine whether \n[Applicant] moved farther away from the tenuous contact with reality which \nhe had when I last saw him and which he probably would have now. \n[Applicant] is a gullible individual who could be easily persuaded to enter \ninto unusual belief systems, including many outside the standard world \nview for the American value system. It would be unusually easy to \nmanipulate or persuade this gentleman to release secrets. He would be \nvulnerable to anyone whom he allowed to enter his magic world. He might \nconceivably believe it was acceptable to release information to the \"Secret \nCat\" or ground evils, or bishops, which are similar to ground devils. \n \n[Applicant's] conditions are inherent and basically lifelong. A man with \nthese cognitive and perceptual distortions and eccentricities is farthest \nfrom one who should be entrusted with national security. \n \n \n \nApplicant was evaluated by a psychologist on November 11, 2008, who was \nprovided the above Applicant's psychiatric evaluation and clinical records. The \npsychologist administered the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory to Applicant \nwho took over three hours to complete the test, an extraordinary time. The validity scale \nfor the test indicates Applicant attempted to present himself in a somewhat positive \nlight, as a moral and trustworthy person. The profile was considered valid. The \npsychologist noted that the test showed Applicant was mildly depressed, with extremely \nlow energy. He avoids eye contact with others and feels uncomfortable in social \nsituations. There were no indications in the basic profile of any psychotic thinking or \ndelusional material. There was a high degree of social discomfort. From the test and the \ninterview, it does not appear that Applicant seeks or enjoys close relationships. He lacks \nclose friends and chooses solitary activities. During the interview, Applicant was friendly \nand cooperative. He made appropriate eye contact. There were no indications of \ndepression. He denied any hallucinations and there were no indications of any \ndelusional material.   \n \n \nThe psychologist determined Applicant was not likely to form close relationships \nat work or in the community. His diagnosis was only Schizotypal Personality Disorder \n\n \n6 \n \nwith a pervasive pattern of detachment from social relationships, and a restricted range \nof expression of emotions in interpersonal settings, beginning by early adulthood and \npresent in a variety of contexts. The condition is long-lasting, a relatively stable pattern, \nbut likely to continue throughout his lifetime. By itself, it is unlikely to cause a defect in \njudgment or reality. The disorder does interfere with Applicant's social interaction. It is \npervasive and does not necessarily show patterns of remission and exacerbation (Item \n9). \n \n \nIn his response to the SOR (Item 3), Applicant denied having a Schizotypal \nPersonality Disorder or a Schizoid Personality Disorder. He does not have any feeling of \nparanoia or delusional thought. He did admit a fear of people or social activities. He \ndoes enjoy certain social activities to include family gatherings and reunions, company \npicnics, attending sporting and cultural events, and attending church. He admits to \nbeing shy and introverted. He thinks his disorder is: \n \n. . . a mild Pervasive Developmental Disorder, which has an early \nchildhood onset and improves with age, as opposed to the personality \ndisorders in question, which usually have an adult onset.  As a child, I was \na late talker, and I often engaged in many unusual fantasies throughout \nmost of my childhood.  As an adult that is no longer the case. \n \n \nIn response to the FORM, Applicant admits to being obsessive compulsive as a \nchild but he is not obsessive compulsive now.  The symptoms of being forgetful, \ndisorganized, prone to misplacing, tardy, messy, and inattentive are characteristics of \nattention deficit disorder which are now under control with adequate sleep and proper \nthyroid medication.  He has not had an outburst of temper in years.  He does not \"drop \nout\" for the same reasons.  He does have sleep apnea which is under control. He does \nnot have a lifelong odd belief and magical thinking. He believes the psychiatrist came to \nhis conclusions based on things Applicant told him about his thoughts as a child.  He \nhas no problem being in public during the day but does prefer privacy when he goes \nhome.  He would not have this privacy if he was married or had a family. Many of the \nconcepts listed by the psychiatrist were from his childhood and no longer a condition or \npresent.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised Administrative Guidelines. In addition to \nbrief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\n \n7 \n \n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline I, Psychological Conditions: \n \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair judgment, \nreliability, or trustworthiness.  A formal diagnosis of a disorder is not required for there to \nbe a concern under this guideline.  A duly qualified mental health professional (e.g. \nclinical psychologist or psychiatrist) employed by or acceptable to and approved by the \nU. S. Government, should be consulted when evaluating potentially disqualifying and \nmitigating information under this guideline (AG \u00b6 28).  \n \n \nApplicant was the patient of a psychiatrist for over five years. The psychiatrist \nconcluded Applicant has Schizotypal Personality Disorder and has characteristics of \nSchizoid Personality Disorder. He notes his lifelong odd beliefs and magical thinking. He \nnotes Applicant's borderline of reality and abnormality, and that his borderline of this \nworld and the other world is vague and indistinct. He concluded that Applicant \nabsolutely should not have access to classified information or be entrusted with national \nsecurity. This opinion raises psychological conditions disqualifying conditions (PH DC) \u00b6 \n28(a) (behavior that casts doubt on an individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness that is not covered under any other guideline, including but not limited to \n\n \n8 \n \nemotionally unstable, irresponsible, dysfunctional, violent, paranoid or bizarre behavior); \nand PH DC AG \u00b6 28(b) (an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that \nthe individual has a condition not covered under any other guideline that may impair \njudgment, reliability, or trustworthiness). \n \n \nI have considered psychological conditions mitigating conditions (PH MC) AG \u00b6 \n29(a) (the indentified condition is readily controllable with treatment, and the individual \nhas demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with the treatment plan; PH MC \nAG \u00b6 29(b) (the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment program for \nthe condition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is currently receiving \ncounseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified mental health \nprofessional); and PH MC AG \u00b6 28(c) (recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health \nprofessional employed by or acceptable to and approved by the U. S. Government that \nan individual's previous condition is under control or in remission, and has a low \nprobability of recurrence or exacerbation); PH MC AG \u00b6 28(d) (the past emotional \ninstability was a temporary condition (e.g., one caused by death, illness, or marital \nbreakup), the situation has been resolved and the individual no longer shows indications \nof emotional instability); and PH MC AG \u00b6 28(e) (there is no indication of a current \nproblem). The psychiatrist determined that Applicant has the inherent lifelong condition \nof Schizotypal Personality Disorder with characteristics of Shizoid Personality Disorder. \nThe psychologist had a similar diagnosis of Schizotypal Personality Disorder that is long \nlasting and likely to continue throughout his life. Based on these diagnoses, none of the \nmitigating conditions apply.  The condition is not treatable, there is no ongoing treatment \nprogram, and Applicant is not under medical care or therapy for the condition. Since the \ncondition is lifelong and inherent, it is not controllable and is not resolved. \n \nWhole Person Concept  \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all \nthe circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept.   \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nThe psychiatrist and the psychologist came to similar conclusions as to \nApplicant's condition, but had different opinions as to the effect of Applicant's condition \non his security worthiness. The psychiatrist after treating Applicant for over five years in \nnumerous sessions stated Applicant should absolutely not be trusted with classified \ninformation. The psychologist noted that by itself the condition is unlikely to cause a \ndefect in judgment or reality, and therefore Applicant's ability to safeguard classified \ninformation. The psychiatrist's opinion is entitled to greater weight. In the medical field, a \npsychiatrist's opinion, as a medical doctor, is more highly regarded than that of a \npsychologist.  In addition, the psychiatrist examined and treated Applicant for over five \nyears, seeing him on multiple visits and sessions. The psychologist only saw Applicant \non limited visits and examined some test results. The psychologist's opinion did not \novercome the psychiatrist's opinion and does not establish that Applicant should have \naccess to classified information. Accordingly, Applicant has not established that he is \ntrustworthy, reliable, and exercises good judgment.  The record evidence leaves me \nwith questions about Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance.  For all \nthese reasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from \nhis psychological condition.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline I:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n_________________ \nTHOMAS M. CREAN \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "full_text": "KEYWORD: Guideline C\nDIGEST: A person who bears arms for a country demonstrates a willingness to risk life and limb\nfor that country which is strong evidence of a profound commitment to the interests of that\ncountry.  A willingness to bear arms for a foreign country raises serious security concerns about\nan applicant seeking access to classified information. These concerns apply here, where, after\nmoving abroad, Applicant voluntarily served in the armed forces of a foreign country for almost\nten years, obtained foreign citizenship in order to facilitate his entry into the armed forces, held a\nforeign security clearance, held an intelligence-related position in the foreign military, accepted\nthe foreign military\u2019s largesse to obtain a graduate degree, and anticipates the receipt of a benefit\nas a result of his foreign military service.  Applicant\u2019s eventual return to the U.S. and his\neventual (after the passage of significant additional time) renunciation of foreign citizenship and\nsurrender of his foreign  passport are insufficient to vitiate the concerns raised by the voluntary\nchoices he made.  On this record, the Judge erred by concluding that Applicant had established a\ncase in mitigation under Guideline C.

Duffy, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On December 16, 2008,  DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant\nof the basis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline C (Foreign Preference) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On April 24, 2009, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Mary E. Henry\ngranted Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Department Counsel timely appealed pursuant\nto the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nDepartment Counsel raises the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge erred by\nconcluding that Applicant mitigated the case against him under Guideline C.  For the following\nreasons, the Board reverses the Judge\u2019s favorable decision. \nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Factual Findings\nA.  The Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact:\nApplicant was born and raised in the United States.  At age 18, he enlisted in the U.S. Army.\nHe served on active duty for three years.  While on active duty, he held a sensitive compartmented\ninformation (SCI) clearance.  Applicant joined the Army reserves.  Applicant married his first wife,\nwho was an Australian citizen.  He received a bachelors degree and returned to active duty as a\nsecond lieutenant.  He served on active duty for three more years and held a security clearance as an\nofficer.  \nApplicant\u2019s first wife became very homesick.  She told Applicant that she intended to return\nto Australia with their daughter.  To preserve his family, Applicant agreed to move to Australia.  The\nArmy honorably discharged him in 1988 and two weeks later, he moved to Australia with his family.\nOnce there, he could not find permanent employment quickly.  In 1988, Applicant contacted the\nAustralian Army recruiting office and asked about joining the military.  As a condition for giving\nhim a commission, the Australian Army required him to apply for Australian citizenship, which he\ndid.  Upon proof of his application, the Australian Army commissioned him in 1989.  Australia\ngranted him citizenship in 1990.  He never renounced his U.S. citizenship and maintained dual\ncitizenship with the U.S. and Australia.  He also maintained both a U.S. and Australian passport.\nThe Australian Army paid for Applicant\u2019s graduate school education and required him to serve an\n\n3\nadditional 18 months of military service.  For a time, Applicant held a top secret clearance in an\nintelligence-related position while in the Australian Army.  \n   As a citizen of Australia, Applicant paid taxes and voted in elections, because voting is\ncompulsory for Australian citizens.  Applicant never owned property in Australia.  While in the\nAustralian Army, Applicant contributed money to a superannuation program, which is similar to a\n401k.  The Australian Army also contributed to this program.  At age 55, Applicant is entitled to take\na lump sum payment from the program, and he plans to do same.  As of 2009, the retirement fund\nwas valued at $87,255.  He will not receive a monthly retirement benefit from the Australian\ngovernment or the Australian Army.  \nIn 1996 Applicant and his first wife separated.  He remained in Australia and in the\nAustralian Army for two more years.  In 1998, he resigned from the Australian Army and returned\nto the United States.  He and his first wife divorced in 2001.  Applicant\u2019s children from his first\nmarriage live in Australia.  Some of his children are dual citizens of Australia and the U.S.  One\nchild is a citizen of Australia, and Applicant is working toward obtaining U.S. citizenship for this\nchild. \nApplicant has held an Australian passport along with his U.S. passport.  For many years,\nbecause of convenience, he used his Australian passport to enter and exit Australia and his U.S.\npassport to enter and exit the U.S.  Since moving out of Australia, he has returned several times to\nvisit his children.  His last visit was in 2007.\nIn 2003, Applicant held a contractor position with a federal agency.  When the agency learned\nthat he claimed dual citizenship, it advised him that he could not work for them unless he renounced\nhis Australian citizenship.  Within a week, Applicant notified the Australian embassy that he wanted\nto renounce his Australian citizenship and he turned in his passport.  The Australian government\naccepted his renunciation and declared him not a citizen of Australia. At that time, his Australian\npassport immediately became invalid.  \nApplicant credibly testified he believed he was not going against the U.S. by joining the\nAustralian Army.  He always considered himself a U.S. citizen and the U.S. his homeland.  He wants\nhis children to have dual citizenship with the U.S. and Australia.  Former commanders and co-\nworkers recommend him and believe that he would never betray classified information.  They do not\ndoubt his allegiance to the U.S.\nB. Discussion\nThe Appeal Board\u2019s review of the Judge\u2019s findings of fact is limited to determining if they\nare supported by substantial evidence\u2013\u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept\nas adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  \u201cThis is something less th an the weight of the evidence, and the possibility\nof drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative\nagency\u2019s finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime\n\n\u201c[T]he individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship.\u201d\n1\n\u201c[T]he passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security authority, or otherwise invalidated.\u201d\n2\n4\nComm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620-21 (1966).  In evaluating the Judge\u2019s findings, we are required to give\ndeference to the Judge\u2019s credibility determinations.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.\nAs Department Counsel does not specifically challenge the Judge\u2019s findings of fact, the\nissues raised on appeal are more appropriately analyzed in terms of challenges to the Judge\u2019s\nconclusions.  This analysis is included in the following section.\n \nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Ultimate Conclusions\nA. Conclusions\nThe Judge reached the following pertinent conclusions: The government established a case\nfor disqualification under Guideline C, but Applicant mitigated the security concerns.  Specifically,\nGuideline C Mitigating Conditions 11 b  and 11 e  apply.  Applicant left Australia almost 11 years\n1\n2\nago and since that time he has not exercised a right of citizenship except to hold and use his\nAustralian  passport when visiting Australia.  Six years ago, Applicant renounced his Australian\ncitizenship, Australia no longer considers him a citizen, and his Australian passport became invalid.\nSince returning to the U.S., Applicant has exercised his rights of U.S. citizenship.  His recent actions\nsupport his testimony that he always considered himself a U.S. citizen and indicate his preference\nfor the U.S.\nUnder the whole person concept, the Judge concluded that the mitigating evidence was more\nsubstantial.  Applicant made his decision to join the Australian Army and obtain Australian\ncitizenship not for personal financial gain, but as a means to provide for his family and not be\ndependent upon his wife\u2019s parents.  Upon his return to the U.S., he did not immediately renounce\nhis Australian citizenship but continued to use his Australian passport, a benefit of Australian\ncitizenship, to visit his children in Australia.  Since his return to the U.S., he has exercised his rights\nof U.S. citizenship, which shows a preference for the U.S.  He made the decision to renounce his\nAustralian citizenship because he considered himself a U.S. citizen first.  He returned to the U.S.\nafter his marriage ended for the same reason.  Applicant has not indicated any intent to return to\nAustralia and has worked to obtain U.S. citizenship for his children.  While his decision 20 years ago\nto apply for Australian citizenship and join the Australian Army raises some concerns about his\neligibility to hold a security clearance, these concerns are outweighed by the actions he has taken in\nthe last 10 years.  \nB. Discussion\nA Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation\nfor\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d\n\n5\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43\n(1983) (quoting Burlington Truck Lines Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  \u201c[N]o one\nhas a right to a security clearance. . . The general standard is that a clearance may be granted only\nwhen \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan,\n484 U.S. 581, 528 (1988).  The Appeal Board may reverse a Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or\nrevoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.3.\nDepartment Counsel contends that the Judge\u2019s decision is not sustainable because she used\na piecemeal analysis to conclude the government\u2019s case was mitigated, failed to assign adequate\nweight to an essential element of the case, namely the implications of Applicant\u2019s voluntary decision\nto serve in the Australian Army and voluntarily obtain Australian citizenship, and reached an\nultimate decision that runs contrary to the record evidence.  Department Counsel\u2019s arguments have\nmerit.\nDepartment Counsel correctly notes that the Judge applied and relied upon two Guideline C\nMitigating Conditions that dealt exclusively with renunciation of dual citizenship and relinquishment\nof foreign passports (see pg. 6 of this Decision) and therefore had no applicability to Applicant\u2019s\ndecision to voluntarily serve in the Australian Army, which raises separate, significant security\nconcerns.  Similarly, Department Counsel contends that the Judge analyzed the record in this case\npiecemeal by concentrating on Applicant\u2019s ultimate renunciation of Australian citizenship and\npassport surrender without properly considering the larger picture presented by the record and\nwithout properly assessing the overall pattern of Applicant\u2019s conduct, which suggests equivocal\npreferences regarding the U.S. and Australia.  A reading of the Judge\u2019s decision convinces the Board\nthat the Judge either failed to consider or did not reasonably assign weight to the profound\nconsequences of a voluntary decision by a U.S. citizen to serve in another country\u2019s military.\nThe Board has noted that a person who is willing to bear arms for a country demonstrates a\nwillingness to risk life and limb for that country.  Such a willingness is strong evidence of a\nprofound, deeply personal commitment to the interests and welfare of that country.  See, e.g., ISCR\nCase No. 00-0317 at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2002).  Accordingly, a willingness to bear arms for a\nforeign country raises serious security concerns about an applicant seeking to be granted access to\nU.S. classified information. Id.  Obviously, these concerns (perhaps in amplified form) would apply\nto the instant case where, after moving abroad, Applicant voluntarily served in the armed forces of\na foreign country as an officer for almost ten years, obtained citizenship in that foreign country in\norder to facilitate his entry into the armed forces, held the security clearance of a foreign country\nwhile in that country\u2019s service, held an intelligence-related position while serving in the military of\na foreign country, accepted the largesse of the foreign country\u2019s military to obtain a graduate degree,\nand anticipates the receipt of a benefit in the form of a sizable lump-sum payment as a result of his\nforeign military service.  Given these circumstances, Applicant had a heavy burden to establish\nmitigation of these expressions of foreign preference.  Applicant\u2019s eventual return to the U.S. and\nhis eventual (after the passage of significant additional time) renunciation of Australian citizenship\nand surrender of his Australian passport are insufficient to vitiate the concerns raised by the\n\nThe Judge does not explain how Applicant\u2019s retention of Australian citizenship after his return to the U.S. was\n3\ninstrumental in furthering his efforts to visit his children in Australia, when, presumably, Applicant could travel to\nAustralia freely as a citizen of the U.S. \nDecision at p. 10.\n4\nAccording to the record evidence, this situation did not arise until the agency in question found out about\n5\nApplicant\u2019s Australian citizenship sometime after he had established a contractor relationship with them. \n6\nvoluntary choices he made in Australia.  On this record, the Judge erred by concluding that Applicant\nhad established a case in mitigation under Guideline C.\nWhile the Judge\u2019s analysis of the case was somewhat broader under the whole person concept\nthan it was under her discussion of Guideline C, it still fails to address adequately the significance\nof Applicant\u2019s Australian citizenship and military service, and offers matters in mitigation that are\ninadequate to overcome the government\u2019s case against Applicant.  The Judge made much of the fact\nthat Applicant became an Australian citizen and joined its military not for personal financial gain,\nbut as a means to provide for his family.  While the preservation of his family may have been the\nnobler goal, the actions taken by Applicant to effectuate that goal nevertheless placed him in a\nposition where, over a period of many years, his personal interests and the interests of another\ncountry took priority over those of the United States.  The Judge\u2019s analysis on this point, which\nessentially treats Applicant\u2019s motive as an important matter in mitigation, fails to recognize that the\ndesire to provide for one\u2019s family can be a significant incentive for one to take actions adverse to\nU.S. interests.  Also,  the Judge mentions the fact that Applicant did not immediately renounce his\nAustralian citizenship upon his return to the U.S. and instead continued to use his Australian\npassport to visit his three children in Australia.  Assuming these facts are being proffered as matters\nin mitigation, the Judge fails to explain how Applicant\u2019s retention of Australian citizenship and use\nof an Australian passport for five years following his return to the United States, a period where his\nearlier concerns about holding his family together were rendered moot by changed circumstances,\ncould possibly alleviate any concerns about Applicant\u2019s manifestations of foreign preference.     \n3\n     \nUsing a whole person analysis, the Judge concluded that concerns over Applicant\u2019s decision\nto apply for Australian citizenship and join the Australian Army were \u201coutweighed by the actions\nhe has taken in the last 10 years, which show a preference for the U.S., not Australia.\u201d   This\n4\nconclusion is not supported by the record evidence.  As discussed in the preceding paragraph, for\nnearly half of that ten year period, Applicant maintained his Australian citizenship and possessed and\nused an Australian passport after reestablishing residency in the U.S.  Thus, the record contains\nobjective evidence indicating that Applicant was equivocal or ambivalent about where his\npreferences lay for a significant period of time.  The record also indicates that Applicant took no\nsteps to renounce his Australian citizenship or surrender the Australian passport until these actions\nbecame a condition precedent to maintaining employment in a contractor position with a U.S. federal\nagency.   These facts undercut the Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant has demonstrated a preference\n5\nfor the U.S. during the last ten years.\n\n7\nThere is insufficient evidence in this case to sustain a conclusion that Applicant has mitigated\nhis numerous actions indicating a foreign preference.  The overall record raises significant doubts\nthat the Judge should have resolved in favor of the national security.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 98-\n0331 at 8 (App. Bd. May 26, 1999).  The Judge\u2019s favorable decision is not sustainable.\nOrder\nThe decision of the Administrative Judge granting Applicant a security clearance is REVERSED.\n     \nSigned: Michael Y.

On December 10,\n2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of\nReasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline C. The action was taken\nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for\nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApril 24, 2009\n\nW hen  SOR allegations are controverted, the government bears the burden of producing evidence sufficient\n1\nto prove controverted allegations. Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.14. That burden has two components. First, the\ngovernment must establish by substantial evidence that the facts and events alleged in the SOR indeed took\nplace. Second, the government must establish a nexus between the existence of the established facts and\nevents and a legitimate security concern. See ISCR Case No. 07-18525 (App. Bd. Feb. 18, 2009), (concurring\nand dissenting, in part).\nGE 1 (e-QIP) at 6, 11-14; Tr. 20-21.\n2\n2\nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on December 30, 2008. He\nanswered the SOR in writing on January 22, 2009, and requested a hearing before an\nadministrative judge. DOHA received the request on January 26, 2009. Department\nCounsel was prepared to proceed on February 27, 2009, and I received the case\nassignment on March 3, 2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on March 9, 2009, and\nI convened the hearing as scheduled on March 30, 2009. The government offered two\nexhibits (GE) 1 and 2, which were received and admitted into evidence without\nobjection. Applicant testified on his own behalf. He submitted three exhibits (AE) A\nthrough C, which were received and admitted into evidence without objection. DOHA\nreceived the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on April 3, 2009. I held the record open until\nApril 14, 2009, for the submission of additional matters.  Applicant timely submitted the\nadditional evidence, which is marked as AE D and admitted into the record without\nobjection. The record closed on April 14, 2009.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nMotion to Amend SOR\nAt the end of testimony, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR to add a\nnew Guideline E allegation. (Tr. 84-93.) Applicant objected to the motion, arguing that\nhe had not received prior notice and had not prepared to defend the new allegation. I\ndenied the motion under due process considerations because Applicant had no prior\nnotice of this new allegation. I also concluded that since the government had notice of\nthis potential issue as of January 21, 2009, it had sufficient time to prepare an amended\nSOR, which would have given Applicant an opportunity to prepare a response to the\nallegation at the hearing. (Tr. 94.)\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated January 21, 2009, Applicant admitted the factual\nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, and 1.e of the SOR, with explanations. He denied the\nfactual allegations in \u00b6 1.c of the SOR.  He also provided additional information to\n1\nsupport his request for eligibility for a security clearance.  \nApplicant, who is 49 years old, was born and raised in the United States (U.S.)\nHe currently works for a Department of Defense contractor as a managing consultant in\nsecurity. He began working as a federal contractor in 2003 for another company. His\ncurrent employer requested that he apply for a security clearance.2\n\nGE 1, supra note 2, at 27-30; Tr. 20, 50-54.\n3\nGE 1, supra note 2, at 19-20; Tr. 55-57; 66-67.\n4\nGE 1, supra note 2, at 22; Tr. 59-61.\n5\n8 USCS \u00a7 1481 et seq addresses when a U.S. citizen may loss citizenship status and the government\u2019s\n6\nburden of proof in such cases.\nGE 2; Tr. 22-32.\n7\n3\nApplicant graduated from high school. In July 1978 at age 18, he enlisted in the\nU.S. Army. He served on active duty from 1978 until 1981. During this time, the Army\nassigned Applicant to a tour of duty in Turkey. Although he was a military policeman in\nTurkey, he held a sensitive compartmented information (SCI) clearance. In 1981, he\njoined the Army reserves and began attending a two-year military college as a cadet.\nAlthough the Army reserves paid him as an E-5, the Army did not pay for this education.\nHe paid for his college through the GI bill and with his money. Applicant received an\nAssociate of Arts degree in statistics in May 1983.3\nApplicant married his first wife, who was an Australian citizen, in December 1983,\nwhile a junior in college. He received his bachelors degree in May 1985. Shortly after his\ncollege graduation, he returned to active duty in the Army as a Second Lieutenant.  He\nserved on active duty from August 1985 until November 1988. During this time, he\nserved an unaccompanied year in Korea and was promoted to First Lieutenant. He also\nheld a secret clearance as an officer.4\nApplicant\u2019s first wife gave birth to a daughter in October 1985. His first wife\nbecame very homesick. She told him she intended to return to Australia with their\ndaughter. To preserve his family, Applicant agreed to move to Australia. The Army\nhonorably discharged him in November 1988, and two weeks later he moved to\nAustralia with his family.5\nWhen he arrived in Australia, Applicant and his family lived with his in-laws, while\nhe sought employment. He could not find permanent employment quickly. In late\nDecember 1988, Applicant contacted the Australian Army recruiting office and asked\nabout joining the military. As a condition for his commission, the Australian Army\nrequired him to apply for Australian citizenship, which he did.  Upon proof of his\n6\napplication, the Australian Army commissioned him in February 1989. His son was born\nin 1989 in Australia. Australia granted him citizenship in November 1990. He never\nrenounced his U.S. citizenship; rather he maintained dual citizenship with the U.S. and\nAustralia. He also maintained both a U.S. and Australian passport.  \n7\nWhile in the Australian Army, Applicant attended graduate school, earning a\nmasters degree in business computing. The Australian Army paid for this education and\nrequired him to serve an additional 18 months of military service. During his years in the\nAustralian Army, Applicant served as a section commander in artillery guns, a unit\n\nGE 2, supra note 7; Tr. 67-69.\n8\nTr. -38-39, 46-49, 77-80.\n9\nTr. 19-20, 41-43, 69-70, \n10\nId. at 41-44.\n11\n4\nwhich used American made guns; a parachute jumper as he did in the American Army,\nand as the assistance administrator for the Australian Joint Intelligence Center. He held\na top secret clearance while in the Australian Army. He described the Australian Army in\nwhich he served as not a nuclear capable military.  \n8\nAs a citizen of Australia, Applicant paid taxes. He also voted in Australian\nelections, because voting is compulsory for Australian citizens. Applicant never owned\nproperty in Australia. He and his family lived in Army housing. While in the Australian\nArmy, Applicant contributed money to a superannuation program, a program similar to a\n401k. The Australian Army also contributed to this program. At age 55, Applicant is\nentitled to take a lump sum payment from the program, which he plans to do. As of\nJanuary 11, 2009, this retirement fund was valued at $87,255. He will not receive a\nmonthly retirement benefit from the Australian government or military.9\n \nIn 1996, his third child, a daughter was born. Less than six months after her birth,\nhe and his first wife separated. He remained in Australian and in the Australian Army for\ntwo more years. In the summer of 1998, he resigned from the Australian Army at the\nrank of Major and returned to the United States. He and his first wife divorced in 2001.\nApplicant married his second wife, who was born and raised in the U.S., six weeks after\nhis divorce. They have two sons, ages 7 and 4, who were born in the U.S. He lives in\nthe U.S. with his second family. His three children from his first marriage live in\nAustralia. His two daughters are dual citizens of the U.S. and Australia. His son is an\nAustralian citizen. He is working towards obtaining U.S. citizenship for his son. He wants\nhis three older children to have U.S. citizenship in addition to their Australian\ncitizenship.10\nAs an Australian citizen, Applicant held an Australian passport along with his U.S.\npassport. For many years and because of the ease afforded to him, he used his\nAustralian passport to enter and exit Australia and his U.S. passport to enter and exit\nthe U.S. Since leaving Australia, he returned several times to visit his children. His last\nvisit occurred in March 2007, when he returned to Australia for the funeral of a friend.\nHis daughters have U.S. and Australian passports.11\nSince returning to the U.S., Applicant worked as a consultant and as a federal\ngovernment contractor. He also voted in U.S. elections. In 2003, he held a contractor\nposition with a federal agency. When the agency learned that he claimed dual\ncitizenship, it advised him that he could not work for them unless he renounced his\nAustralian citizen. Within a week, Applicant notified the Australian embassy that he\nwanted to renounce his Australian citizen and turned in his passport. Australia formally\n\nAE D; Tr. 40-46 72-74. \n12\nAE A; AE B; AE C: Tr. 27, 92-93.\n13\n5\naccepted his renunciation and declared him not a citizen of Australia on June 20, 2003.\nHis Australian passport immediately became invalid. Once he renounced his Australian\ncitizenship, he returned to his federal contractor job.  \n12\nApplicant credibly testified that he believed he was not going against the U.S. by\njoining the Australian Army. He always considered himself a U.S. citizen and the U.S.\nhis homeland. He wants his three older children to have dual citizenship with Australia\nand the U.S. His former military commander and a former military co-worker wrote a\nstrong letters of recommendation on his behalf, indicating that the only reason Applicant\njoined the Australian Army was to keep his family together. A more recent co-worker\nalso wrote a strong letter of recommendation on his behalf. All believe that he would\nnever betray classified information and do not doubt his allegiance to the U.S.13\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\n\nAfter any decision, the losing party has a right to appeal the case to the Defense Office of Hearings and\n14\nAppeals  Appeal Board. The Appeal Board\u2019s review authority is limited to determining whether three tests are\nmet:\nE3.1.32.1. The Administrative Judge\u2019s findings of fact are supported by such relevant\nevidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of\nall the contrary evidence in the same record. In making this review, the Appeal Board shall\ngive deference to the credibility determinations of the Administrative Judge:\nE#.a.32.2. The Administrative Judge adhered to the procedures required by E.O. 10865\n(enclosure 1) and this Directive: or\nE3.1.32.3. The Administrative Judge\u2019s rulings or conclusions are arbitrary, capricious, or\ncontrary to law.\nThe Appeal Board does not conduct a \u201cde novo determination\u201d, recognizing that its members have\nno opportunity to observe witnesses and make credibility determinations. The Supreme Court in United States\nv. Raddatz, 447 U.S. 667, 690 (1980) succinctly defined the phrase \u201cde novo determination\u201d:\n[This legal term] has an accepted meaning in the law. It means an independent determination\nof a controversy that accords no deference to any prior resolution of the same controversy.\nThus, in Renegotiation Board v. Bannercraft Clothing Co., 415 U.S. 1, 23 [(1974)], the Court\nhad occasion to define \u201cde novo proceeding\u201d as a review that was \u201cunfettered by any\nprejudice from the [prior] agency proceeding and free from any claim that the [agency\u2019s]\ndetermination is supported by substantial evidence.\u201d In United States v. First City National\nBank, 386 U.S. 361,368 [(1967)], this Court observed that \u201creview de novo\u201d means \u201cthat the\ncourt should make an independent determination of the issues\u201d and should not give any\nspecial weight to the [prior] determination of the administrative agency.\n(Internal footnotes omitted). See ISCR Case No. 07-10396 (App. Bd., Oct. 2, 2008) and ISCR Case No. 07-\n07144 (App. Bd., Oct. 7, 2008). In ISCR Case No. 05-01820 (App. Bd. Dec 14, 2006), the Appeal Board\ncriticized the administrative judge\u2019s analysis, supporting grant of a clearance for a PRC-related Applicant, and\nthen decided the case itself. Judge W hite\u2019s dissenting opinion cogently explains why credibility determinations\nand ultimately the decision whether to grant or deny a clearance should be left to the judge who makes\nwitness credibility determinations. Id. at 5-7. See also ISCR Case No. 04-06386 at 10-11 (App. Bd. Aug. 25,\n2006)(Harvey, J., dissenting) (discussing limitations on Appeal Board\u2019s authority to reverse hearing-level\njudicial decisions and recommending remand of cases to resolve material, prejudicial error) and ISCR Case\nNo. 07-03307 (App. Bd. Sept. 29, 2008). Compliance with the Agency\u2019s rules and regulations is required. See\nUnited States ex. rel. Acardi  v. Shaughnessy, 347 U.S. 260, 268 (1954); Lopez v. FAA, 318 F.3d 242, 247-\n248 (D.C. Cir 2003); Nickelson  v. United States, 284 F. Supp.2d 387, 390 (E.D. Va. 2003)( explaining\nstandard of review).\n6\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.  \n14\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\n\n7\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline C, Foreign Preference\nUnder AG \u00b6 9 the security concern involving foreign preference arises, \u201c[W]hen\nan individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over\nthe United States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or make\ndecisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.\u201d\nAG \u00b6 10 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying:\n(a) exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after\nbecoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family\nmember.  This includes but is not limited to:\n(1) possession of a current foreign passport;\n(2) military service or a willingness to bear arms for a foreign\ncountry;\n(3) accepting educational, medical, retirement, social\nwelfare, or other such benefits from a foreign country;\n(4) residence in a foreign country to meet citizenship requirements;\nand\n(7) voting in a foreign election;\n(b) action to acquire or obtain recognition of a foreign citizenship by an\nAmerican citizen;\nApplicant moved to Australia in 1988. He applied for Australian citizenship when\nhe joined the Australian Army in 1989. Australia granted him citizenship in November\n1990 and he became a dual citizen of the U.S. and Australia. He served in the\nAustralian Army for nearly 10 years. He will receive money from a superannuation\nprogram, to which he contributed funds when he was in the Australian Army. As a\n\n8\ncitizen of Australia, he was required to vote in elections and did. The government has\nestablished a security concern under AG \u00b6\u00b6 10(a)(1)-(4), 10(a)(7), and 10(b).\nAG \u00b6 11 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. In this case,\nthe potential applicable mitigating conditions are:\n(b) the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship; and\n(e) the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant\nsecurity authority, or otherwise invalidated.\nApplicant left Australia almost 11 years ago. Since that time, he has not\nexercised right of citizenship except to hold and use his Australian passport when\nvisiting Australia. Six years ago, Applicant renounced his Australian citizenship when he\nlearned it would impede his employment as a contractor at a federal facility. As of June\n2003, Australia no longer considered him a citizen and his Australian passport became\ninvalid. Since returning to the U.S., Applicant has exercised his rights of U.S. citizenship\nby voting in U.S. elections, paying taxes, and holding a U.S. passport. His recent\nactions support his testimony that he always considered himself a U.S. citizen and\nindicate his preference for the U.S. Applicant has mitigated the government\u2019s security\nconcerns.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. The decision to grant or\ndeny a security clearance requires a careful weighing of all relevant factors, both\nfavorable and unfavorable. In so doing, an administrative judge must review all the\nevidence of record, not a single item in isolation, to determine if a security concern is\nestablished and then whether it is mitigated. A determination of an applicant\u2019s eligibility\nfor a security clearance should not be made as punishment for specific past conduct,\n\n9\nbut on a reasonable and careful evaluation of all the evidence of record to decide if a\nnexus exists between established facts and a legitimate security concern. \nThe mitigating evidence under the whole person concept is more substantial. In\nreaching a conclusion, I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case, even if not\nspecifically discussed. Applicant married an Australian-born woman in 1983 and their\nfirst daughter was born in 1985. His wife became very homesick and decided to return\nto Australia with their daughter, with or without Applicant. To preserve his family,\nApplicant resigned his commission in the U.S. Army and moved to Australia, a drastic\nmove because at the time, it appeared it would be a permanent change of country. He\nwould no longer live in the U.S., his homeland. \nApplicant did not immediately find permanent work in corporate Australia. He\ntalked with the Australian Army about joining based on his nearly 10 years of military\nexperience in the U.S. Army. As a condition to joining the Australian Army, he applied\nfor Australian citizenship, which Australia granted to him in November 1990. He made\nthis decision, not for personal financial gain, but as a means to provide for his family\nand not be dependent upon his wife\u2019 parents for housing and other essentials of life. He\nwanted to be responsible for his family and he could take care of his family with a job in\nthe Australian Army.\nApplicant remained in Australia for nearly 10 years, working in the Australian\nArmy until he decided to return to the U.S. He and his wife separated in 1996. Two\nyears later, he decided to return to the U.S., his homeland. He did not immediately\nrenounce his Australian citizenship upon his return to the U.S. Rather, he continued to\nuse his Australian passport, a benefit of Australian citizenship, to visit his three children\nin Australia.  Since his return to the U.S., he has exercised his rights of U.S. citizenship,\nwhich shows a preference for the U.S. Other than maintenance of his Australian\npassport, Applicant did not exercise any rights of Australian citizenship after he returned\nto the U.S.\nIn 2003, Applicant renounced his Australian citizenship and returned his\nAustralian passport when he learned that his Australian citizenship interfered with his\ncontinued employment as a federal contractor. He made the decision to renounce his\nAustralian citizenship because he considered himself a U.S. citizen first. He returned to\nthe U.S. after his marriage ended because the U.S. was his homeland and his preferred\nplace of residence. Although his employment spurred his decision to renounce his\nAustralian citizenship, his renunciation was not purely for financial gain. Again, he\nneeded to work to support his family and he had skills which were beneficial to the U.S.\ngovernment. Prior to his renunciation, he had shown his preference for the U.S. by\nreturning to the U.S., by working in the U.S., by marrying a U.S. citizen, and by raising\nhis second family in the U.S. He has not indicated any intent to return to Australia.\nRather, he has successfully worked to obtain U.S. citizenship for his two daughters and\nhis still working towards U.S. citizenship for his son. His efforts to make sure his three\nolder children have U.S. citizenship indicate again his preference for the U.S. over\n\n10\nAustralia. While his decision 20 years ago to apply for Australian citizenship and join the\nAustralian Army raises some concerns about his eligibility to hold a security clearance,\nthese concerns are outweighed by the actions he has taken in the last 10 years, which\nshows a preference for the U.S., not Australia. The fact that he is entitled to a payment\nfrom a 401k type retirement program at age 55 does not show a preference for Australia\nover the U.S. He contributed money from his earnings to this program and will take the\nlump sum payment as soon as he is eligible to accept the payment. He invested his\nmoney in a retirement program and will receive a return on his investment at age 55.\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising under Guideline C. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline C:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Howry, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMASON, Paul J., Administrative Judge:\nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SCA, Item 4), on\nSeptember 12, 2007. On November 20, 2007, Applicant was interviewed by an\ninvestigator from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). The subject of the\ninterview was not filing federal or state tax returns since 1980. Applicant agreed with the\ncontents of this interview in his interrogatory answers (Item 6) dated July 31, 2009. On\nOctober 1, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under financial considerations\n(Guideline F). The action was taken pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and adjudicative guidelines (AG)\nMarch 23, 2010\n\n2\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and made effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued on or after September 1, 2006.\nApplicant submitted his answer to the SOR on October 12, 2009 (Item 3). He\nrequested a decision on the record in lieu of a hearing. A copy of the Government\u2019s File\nof Relevant Material (FORM), the government\u2019s evidence in support of the allegations of\nthe SOR, was sent to Applicant on November 23, 2009. Applicant received the FORM\non December 2, 2009. He provided his response to the FORM on December 7, 2009.\nHis response consists of two federal tax form worksheets filed for the years 2007 and\n2008. The case file was assigned to me on February 1, 2010. \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is 61 years old. He has never been married. He has lived in Arizona\nsince 1992. Applicant was hired permanently by his current employer (a defense\ncontractor) in August 2007 (SCA, Item 4). He is an engineering technician. According to\nhis SCA, he has never been investigated for a security clearance, and he has no\ncriminal record or financial problems (Id.). \nThe SOR alleges under financial considerations (Guideline F) that Applicant\nfailed to file federal and state tax returns between 1980 and 2007. Applicant admitted all\nthe allegations except for SOR 1.ccc., failure to file a federal return in 2007. He also\nadmitted he should have filed for 1995 because he earned more than $16,000.  \nDuring his November 11, 2007, interview, Applicant admitted he filed no federal\nor state returns since 1980 because he earned less than $10,000 a year during the\nperiod (Item 6, interrogatory answers, July 31, 2009 (containing his November 11, 2007-\ninterview)), which he claims are below the minimum amount necessary to require the\nfiling of tax returns. He claimed he was not trying to intentionally avoid paying taxes.\nSince 1992, Applicant has also been self-employed as a cabinetmaker in addition to\nother employment (SCA, Item 4). His other employment has included his current\nemployer (a defense contractor) on an as-needed basis. \nIn an attached statement to his answer to the SOR (Item 3, answer to SOR),\nApplicant explained \u201c. . . how and why tax returns have never been important to me and\nthus never filed.\u201d He entered the work force in 1965 (Item 3). He was employed by a\nnational appliance company, working his way up to a master technician position. He had\na comfortable lifestyle. He lost that job in 1975 because of his appearance. Applicant\npicked avocados for a time and traveled the country with a friend. By 1977, Applicant\nfound that he no longer had the same desires as he had earlier in his life (Id.). He\nappeared to be going through a transformation about what he considered important in\nlife. \nIn 1984, he rented a garage with his girlfriend, and began to devote more time to\nmaking wood products. In 1992, Applicant began self-employment as a cabinetmaker in\naddition to his other employment in other jobs. He bought an old car and spent much\n\n3\ntime at the beach. He also picked avocados and studied rattlesnakes. Also in 1992, he\nworked on a ranch and continued to study snakes. After some hands-on training,\nApplicant began working on several electrician jobs (Id.). \nIn 2005, he was offered a temporary job with his current employer. One of\nApplicant\u2019s previous employers told him that if he earned less than $10,000, he owed no\ntaxes. Since 1975, Applicant noted his earnings between $5,000 and $8,000 (Id.). In\n2009, after telling a friend he earned $16,000 in 2008, the friend urged Applicant to file a\nreturn. Applicant discovered he had overpaid the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) by\n$800, and received a tax refund for that amount (Id.; response to FORM).\nIn the last paragraph of his attached statement to the SOR, Applicant indicated\nhe was a free and honest man. He pays cash for everything and has never borrowed\nmoney (Id). In his response to the FORM, Applicant indicated he had no problems with\nmoney and he had no debts. \nAlso attached to Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR is a copy of his federal earnings\nrecord generated by the Social Security Administration (SSA) (Item 3). The record\nshows that between 1965 through 2008, his gross income was at least $9,350\n(minimum earning amount necessary to file an IRS tax return in 2009) in 1995 and 2008\n(Item 3). However, because of Applicant\u2019s self-employment since 1992 during his\nemployment at other jobs, his earning figures after 1991 must be questioned. \nItem 7 (tax instructions for 2009 filing tax returns) indicates at page 7 that a\ntaxpayer should file a return to get a refund of federal tax withheld. \nIn Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM dated December 7, 2007, he provided\ncompleted tax returns for 2007 and 2008. His 2007 tax return was filed in January 2008,\nand his 2008 tax return was filed in January 2009. His 2008 tax return reflects that he\nreceived a tax refund of approximately $700. Aside from his stated intentions to file\nfederal and state tax returns in the future, Applicant presented no other evidence of\nfiling federal or state tax returns for any other years identified in the SOR (response to\nFORM).  \nCharacter Evidence\nApplicant provided no statements or independent evidence regarding his job\nperformance and/or reputation in the community where he lives. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines\n\n4\nare applied in conjunction with the variables listed in the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The\nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person,\npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.\nReasonable doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security. In reaching this decision, I have\ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence\ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere\nspeculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nAnalysis\nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18. The Concern. \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy\ndebts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An\nindividual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to\ngenerate funds. Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes\nincluding espionage. Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is\nalso a security concern. It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal\nacts.\u201d\nThe disqualifying condition that is controlling in this case is AG \u00b6 19(g) (failure to\nfile annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns as required or the fraudulent filing\nof the same). \nEveryone has a duty to file federal and state tax returns, regardless of whether\nthey owe taxes or are entitled to a refund. The SOR alleges and Applicant admits he\nfiled neither file federal nor state income tax returns from 1980 through 2007.\nApplicant\u2019s failure to file tax returns over a 27-year period establishes disqualifying\nconduct under AG \u00b6 19(g). His failure to file returns is aggravated by the fact he filed no\nreturns for his self-employment business that he started in 1992. His Social Security\nearnings after 1991 must be questioned. Because of his continuing self-employment\nwhile working at other jobs, his taxable income could have been much more than the\nentries on his earnings record. \n\n5\nApplicant\u2019s failure to file tax returns may be mitigated by AG \u00b6 20(a) (the\nbehavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment); AG \u00b6 20 (b) (the conditions that resulted\nin the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control and the individual\nacted responsibly under the circumstances); AG \u00b6 20(c) (the person has received or is\nreceiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem\nis being resolved or is under control); and AG \u00b6 20(d) (the individual initiated a good-\nfaith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts). \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is inapplicable as Applicant\u2019s failed to file federal ands state tax\nreturns for 27 consecutive years. The pattern of conduct did not end until January 2008\nwhen he filed his 2007 tax return. The frequency of Applicant\u2019s failure to file and the fact\nthat he still has filed no federal or state tax returns for the other years identified in the\nSOR continue to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good\njudgment. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) applies to unforeseen circumstances that are largely beyond the\nindividual\u2019s control. Applicant provided no reason (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation) under this\ncondition to support his failure to file tax returns for 27 years. Even though he may have\nowed no taxes for any year in question, he still should have filed tax returns.\nAG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply as Applicant provided no evidence he has ever had\nfinancial counseling. While Applicant has filed his federal returns for 2007 and 2008, he\nhas not indicated whether he plans to file his federal and state tax returns for the other\nyears listed in the SOR. Without filed returns for the other years, there are no clear\nindications that Applicant\u2019s financial problems are being resolved or are under control. \nAG \u00b6 20(d), which applies to \u201ca good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors,\u201d does\nnot apply either. Having weighed the adverse evidence of not filing federal and state tax\nreturns for 27 years, Applicant\u2019s filing of federal tax returns for 2007 and 2008, coupled\nwith his promise to file returns in the future, I conclude that Applicant presented\ninsufficient evidence under the mitigating conditions to find his favor under the financial\nconsiderations guideline. \nWhole Person Concept (WPC) \nI have examined the evidence utilizing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions\nof the financial guideline. Even though I have resolved the guideline against Applicant,\nthe case still must be weighed within the context of nine variables known as the whole\nperson concept. In evaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the\nadministrative judge should consider the following factors: \nAG \u00b6 2(a) (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\n\n6\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich the participation was voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and, (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe first time Applicant failed to file his federal or state tax return was in 1981 (for\ntax year 1980) at the age of 32. Tax returns are always filed a year after the tax year in\nquestion. Yet for the next 27 years, Applicant filed no federal or state returns. In\naddition, he filed no tax returns for his self-employment that began after 1991. The fact\nthat Applicant earned less than $10,000 during all but two years of the period does not\nrise to the level of a \u201ccondition\u201d that mitigates his duty of failing to file federal and state\ntax returns. Though I do not believe Applicant was trying to hide tax information from the\ngovernment or that he was trying to protest payment of income taxes at the federal or\nstate level, he had a duty to file, and he breached his duty. See, 26 United States Code\n\u00a7 7203. \nApplicant indicated in his answer to the SOR and his response to the FORM that\nhe is an honest man without any money problems. The absence of money problems\nprovides no justification for his failure to file federal and state tax returns. The financial\nguideline is resolved against Applicant. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1 (Financial Considerations, Guideline F): AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a. through 1 bbb. \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.ccc. \nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.ddd. \nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n                       \nPaul J. Mason\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Hoffman, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nCURRY, Marc E., Administrative Judge:\nIn 2006, Applicant agreed to accept an administrative discharge from the U.S.\nNavy under other than honorable conditions rather than face a court-martial, after an\ninvestigator confiscated several marijuana plants from his home on base housing.\nApplicant mitigated the criminal conduct security concern generated by this incident, but\nfailed to mitigated the personal conduct security concern. Clearance is denied.\nOn December 10, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under\nGuidelines J and E. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nAugust 26, 2009\n\n2\nOn February 5, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR, admitting all of the\nallegations and requesting a hearing. The case was assigned to me on May 15, 2009.\nOn June 3, 2009, a notice of hearing was issued scheduling the case for June 22, 2009.\nThe hearing was held as scheduled. At the hearing, I received four government exhibits,\ntwo Applicant exhibits, and Applicant\u2019s testimony. The transcript was received on June\n29, 2009.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 31-year-old married man with one infant child and two stepchildren.\nA previous marriage ended in divorce. For the past three years, he has worked for a\ndefense contractor as a marine electrician, providing installation and maintenance for\nthe U.S. Navy fleet\u2019s phone and cable (Exhibit B). According to his supervisor, his\nperformance is consistently exceptional (Id.).\nShortly after graduating from high school in 1995, Applicant joined the U.S. Navy.\nHe received training as an interior communications technician, and spent most of his\ntenure in this field. (Exhibit A). He was a highly effective sailor. In February 2001, a\nsupervisor characterized him as his \u201cbest interior communications technician [who was]\nhighly motivated toward advancing his career\u201d (Exhibit A at 13). According to a\nsupervisor in 2005, Applicant was a superior manager and administrator whose\nperformance was \u201cabsolute[ly] stellar,\u201d and who excelled in subordinate development\n(Exhibit A at 4).\nApplicant met his current spouse in November 2002, and married her three years\nlater, in February 2005 (Exhibit 4 at 3). Approximately four months later, after\ndiscovering drug paraphernalia in their car, Applicant confronted her, and discovered\nshe was a marijuana user (Id.). They frequently argued about her marijuana usage over\nthe next several months. Ultimately, he \u201cturned a blind eye to it\u201d (Id.).\nApplicant and his wife were avid gardeners. They purchased materials during the\nwinter of 2006 to cultivate vegetable plants indoors, including heat lamps and reflective\nshields (Tr. 34). They then began growing the plants in a closet in the basement.\nApplicant\u2019s wife planted five or six marijuana plants along with the vegetables (Tr. 35).\nAt the hearing, Applicant testified that he did not discover she was growing marijuana\nuntil the early spring when he \u201cchecked up on everything\u201d in preparation for planting the\nvegetables outdoors (Tr. 35). Conversely, in his statement to a U.S. Naval Criminal\nInvestigative Service (NCIS) agent, he stated as follows:\nWhen we moved . . . this past January [she] got the idea to start growing\nher own marijuana . . .. It was her project, for her own personal use . . . I\nhad seen the setup in the downstairs closet but ignored it, because it was\nfor her own personal use (Exhibit 4 at 3). \nI find Applicant knew his wife was growing marijuana in their basement by January\n2006.\n\n3\nIn June 2006, Applicant and his wife hosted a party (Tr. 62). One of their friends\nwent downstairs, opened the closet door, discovered the marijuana, and reported it to\nthe police (Id.). A few weeks later, several Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS)\ninvestigators came to Applicant\u2019s home with a search warrant, and confiscated the\nmarijuana (Exhibit 2 at 3). Neither Applicant nor his wife was arrested or charged. They\nwere informed, however, that an investigation would be pending.\nAs part of the investigation, an NCIS agent interviewed Applicant\u2019s wife. She\nstated that Applicant was aware of her marijuana-growing scheme, but did not\nparticipate (Exhibit 4 at 6).\nLater, civil law enforcement authorities arrested and charged Applicant\u2019s wife\nwith wrongful use and possession of a controlled substance, a misdemeanor (Tr. 55).\nShe pleaded guilty, and was sentenced to 150 hours of community service, and fined\n$775 (Tr. 41). Also, she was ordered to attend counseling for three months (Tr. 40).\nApplicant\u2019s command gave him the option of either accepting a discharge under\nother than honorable conditions, or facing a court-martial under UCMJ Article 112(a) for\nwrongful use, possession, or manufacture of marijuana (Exhibit 2 at 3). Applicant chose\nthe former option, and was discharged in August 2006 (Exhibit 4). \nApplicant never used marijuana either before or after the incident (Tr. 47). His\nwife no longer uses marijuana (Tr. 41). Applicant is active in his church, providing\ndaycare for children during services, and helping to organize carolling sessions during\nthe holiday season (Tr. 65).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d \n\n4\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\nAnalysis\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nUnder this guideline, \u201ccriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness [and] by its very nature, . . . it calls into question a\nperson\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations\u201d (AG \u00b6 30). \nThe SOR alleges Applicant, while in the Navy, committed a crime by permitting\nhis wife to grow marijuana in their home located on base. Applicant asserts that he\nneither used nor approved of his wife\u2019s marijuana cultivation. He chose to ignore it only\nafter unsuccessfully admonishing her to stop. Under UCMJ Article 112(a), it is a crime\nto use, possess, or manufacture controlled substances. Possession includes \u201cthe power\nor authority to preclude control by others\u201d (UCMJ Article 112(c)). I conclude Applicant\u2019s\nconduct constituted a crime. AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a), \u201c a single serious crime or multiple lesser\noffenses,\u201d and 31(c), \u201callegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether\nthe person was formally charged, formally prosecuted, or convicted,\u201d apply.\nApplicant\u2019s criminal conduct was isolated and has not recurred. He has a good\nemployment record, and is active in his community. The vulnerability to coercion\nthrough his wife is minimized because she no longer abuses marijuana. AG \u00b6 32(d),\n\u201cthere is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited to, the passage\nof time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or\nhigher education, good employment record, or constructive community involvement,\u201d\napplies. Applicant has mitigated the criminal conduct security concern.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nUnder this guideline, \u201cconduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonest, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified\ninformation\u201d (AG \u00b6 15). Applicant, by allowing his wife to grow marijuana in the\nbasement of their home on base housing, subordinated his commitment to the U.S.\nNavy\u2019s core values. Consequently, although he mitigated the security concern regarding\nthe criminal nature of his conduct, the questionable judgment that he demonstrated\nremains in question. AG \u00b6 16(e), \u201cpersonal conduct, or concealment of information\nabout one\u2019s conduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress\n. . .\u201d applies. \n\n5\nApplicant\u2019s testimony regarding when he was aware that his wife was cultivating\nmarijuana in their basement contradicted his earlier signed, sworn statement to an NCIS\ninvestigator. This contradiction undermines his credibility, and renders any of the\nmitigating conditions inapplicable. Applicant has not mitigated the personal conduct\nsecurity concerns.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider\nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5)the  extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nApplicant\u2019s exceptional work performance both during and after his stint in the\nNavy, the isolated nature of his crime, and his history of volunteerism mitigates the\ncriminal conduct security concern. However, the personal conduct ramifications of\nApplicant\u2019s decision to ignore his wife\u2019s marijuana cultivation were compounded by his\nfailure to testify about it truthfully at the hearing. I conclude Applicant mitigated the\ncriminal conduct security concern, but failed to mitigate the personal conduct security\nconcern.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a - -1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline J:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\n\n6\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                             \nMARC E. CURRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Amendment of the SOR After Applicant testified, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR \u00b6 1.a by adding an allegation that Applicant exercised dual U.S.-Italian citizenship by voting in at least two Italian elections (Tr. 100-04).

Eligibility for access \nto classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on January 29, 2008. On \nDecember 5, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny her \napplication, citing security concerns under Guidelines C and B. The action was taken \nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President \non December 29, 2005.  \n \nMarch 30, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant received the SOR on December 12, 2008; answered it on answered in \non December 16. 2008; and requested an administrative determination on the record \nwithout a hearing before an administrative judge. DOHA received the request on \nDecember 18, 2008. Department Counsel requested a hearing on January 13, 2009 \n(Hearing Exhibit (HX) I), and was ready to proceed on February 2, 2009. The case was \nassigned to an administrative judge on February 3, 2009, and reassigned to me on \nFebruary 12, 2009, based on workload. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on February \n18, 2009, scheduling the hearing for March 5, 2009. I convened the hearing as \nscheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 3 were admitted in evidence without \nobjection. Applicant testified on her own behalf and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) \nA through D, which were admitted without objection.  \n \nI directed Department Counsel to submit documentary evidence to support my \ntaking of administrative notice of relevant facts about Italy not later than March 13, \n2009, and I permitted Applicant to submit additional documentary evidence during that \nsame period (Tr. 94-98). Department Counsel submitted a request to take \nadministrative notice, along with supporting materials, on March 9, 2009 (HX II). It is \ndiscussed below. Applicant timely submitted AX E through G, which were admitted \nwithout objection (HX III).  The record closed on March 13, 2009. DOHA received the \ntranscript (Tr.) on March 23, 2009. \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nAdministrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of relevant facts \nabout Italy. The request and the documents attached as enclosures were not admitted \nin evidence but are attached to the record as HX II. The facts administratively noticed \nare set out below in my findings of fact. \n \nAmendment of the SOR \n \n \nAfter Applicant testified, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR \u00b6 1.a by \nadding an allegation that Applicant exercised dual U.S.-Italian citizenship by voting in at \nleast two Italian elections (Tr. 100-04). The motion was based on Applicant\u2019s testimony, \nand she did not object to the amendment. I granted the motion and made a handwritten \nnotation on the SOR reflecting the amendment. \n \nRequest to Withdraw Security Clearance Application \n \n \nAfter the hearing, Applicant sent me a request to withdraw her application for a \nsecurity clearance (AX E). Notwithstanding her request, I have continued processing \nthis case in accordance with the Directive \u00b6 4.41, which provides that, \u201cActions pursuant \nto this Directive shall cease upon termination of the applicant\u2019s need for access to \nclassified information except in those cases in which . . . [a] hearing has commenced.\u201d \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn her answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in SOR, but \nshe denied having a preference for a foreign country or being vulnerable to pressure or \ncoercion by any foreign interest. Her admissions in her answer and at the hearing are \nincorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 59-year-old Italian linguist, working for a company that provides \ntranslators for the U.S. government. She has worked for her current employer since \nJanuary 2008. She has never held a security clearance.  \n \n \nApplicant received a degree in philosophy in Rome, Italy, in 1974. She came to \nthe U.S. in 1977 as a member of a religious organization, but she left the organization in \n1988 because of philosophical and theological differences (Tr. 50-51). She decided to \nstay in the U.S. because of the open-minded atmosphere she found in the U.S. (Tr. 88-\n89). She obtained a master\u2019s degree in theology from a U.S. university in August 1990. \nShe married a native-born U.S. citizen in August 1993, and she became a U.S. citizen \nin May 1999.  \n \n \nApplicant held an Italian passport that was issued in December 1997, and it \nexpired in December 2002. She renewed her Italian passport in October 2003. It will \nexpire in October 2013. She is unwilling to relinquish her Italian passport because she \nwants to preserve her Italian citizenship, especially if her husband predeceases her and \nshe wishes to return to Italy. She is unwilling to renounce her Italian citizenship because \nshe might not be able to regain it if there were future changes in the geopolitical \nsituation (GX 3 at 2). She is unwilling to relinquish her passport because it is her only \nproof of Italian citizenship; and it allows her to open a bank account, buy property, and \nlive in Italy part-time if she desires (GX 2 at 4; Tr. 79-80). Since becoming a U.S. citizen, \nshe has voted in Italian elections on three or four occasions, because she wants to \nparticipate in the Italian political process (Tr. 75-77, 91). She does not own any property \nor have any bank accounts in Italy (Tr. 75). She admitted at the hearing that she has \n\u201cone foot in each country.\u201d (Tr. 91-92.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s father, mother, two brothers, and two sisters are citizens and \nresidents of Italy. She visits her family annually, accompanied by her husband, and she \nusually stays three or four weeks (GX 3 at 1). Applicant usually uses her U.S. passport \nwhen she travels to Italy, but she has used her Italian passport two or three times (Tr. \n72-73). She talks to her parents by telephone about twice a week, her brothers four or \nfive times a year, one sister three or four times a year, and the other sister about once a \nyear (GX 3 at 2). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s father and mother are both retired employees of the Italian \ngovernment, and they both receive pensions from the Italian government. Her mother \nworked as a switchboard operator, and her father was in charge of the archives of the \nItalian Treasury Department (Tr. 54-55). One of her brothers works for a private \ninsurance company, and his wife works for a municipal housing department (Tr. 57-58). \n\n \n4 \n \n \nHer other brother works for a telephone company, and his wife is a stay-at-home \nhousewife (Tr. 60). One of her sisters is a public school teacher who is married to a \nretired bank employee (Tr. 62). Her other sister works for a regional government in Italy, \nand her husband recently retired from a senior position in the regional government (AX \nE, F 2, and G). Applicant knows little about this sister and her family because their \nrelationship is strained (Tr. 64-66). \n \n \nOne of Applicant\u2019s co-workers who has known her for more than 12 years \nsubmitted a letter on her behalf describing her as a perfectionist, a person of high \nintegrity, and a polite and calm person with an engaging personality (AX B). A member \nof her church considers her deeply religious, heavily involved in church activity, and a \nkind and courteous person (AX C). A U.S. government employee, who has known \nApplicant for 17 years, describes her as very conscientious, diligent, an \u201cunfailingly \npolite hostess,\u201d and a person of deep moral convictions (AX D).  \n \n \nI have taken administrative notice that Italy has been a constitutional republic \nsince 1948, with a bicameral legislature, a multiparty political system, and an \nindependent judiciary. The U.S. and Italy are NATO allies, and they enjoy warm and \nfriendly relations and cooperate on major economic and trade issues. Under \nlongstanding bilateral agreements, Italy hosts about 13,000 U.S. military personnel at \nvarious military installations in Italy. Italy was a founding member of the European \nUnion, firmly supports the United Nations, and is a leading partner of the U.S. in the war \nagainst terrorism. The administrative notice documents submitted by Department \nCounsel reflect no evidence that Italy conducts intelligence operations against the U.S. \nItaly has a generally good human rights record. Although there have been occasional \nepisodes of politically-motivated violence, attributed to organized crime and anarchist \nmovements, Italy remains largely free of terrorist incidents.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \ncontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no \nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference \n \n \nThe SOR, as amended, alleges Applicant exercised dual citizenship with Italy by \nobtaining an Italian passport and by voting in at least two Italian elections (SOR \u00b6 1.a). \nIt also alleges she traveled to Italy in June 2007, June 2006, May 2005, November \n2003, May 2002, and September 2000 (SOR \u00b6 1.b). The security concern under this \nguideline is as follows: \u201cWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a \npreference for a foreign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to \nprovide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United \nStates.\u201d AG \u00b6 9. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \nDual citizenship standing alone is not sufficient to warrant an adverse security \nclearance decision. ISCR Case No. 99-0454 at 5, 2000 WL 1805219 (App. Bd. Oct. 17, \n2000). Under Guideline C, \u201cthe issue is not whether an applicant is a dual national, but \nrather whether an applicant shows a preference for a foreign country through actions.\u201d  \nISCR Case No. 98-0252 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep 15, 1999). A disqualifying condition may \narise from \u201cexercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after \nbecoming a U.S. citizen,\u201d including but not limited to \u201cpossession of a current foreign \npassport\u201d or \u201cvoting in a foreign election.\u201d AG \u00b6 10(a)(1) and (7).  \n \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is not limited to countries hostile to the \nU.S. \u201cUnder the facts of a given case, an applicant\u2019s preference, explicit or implied, \neven for a nation with which the U.S. has enjoyed long and peaceful relations, might \npose a challenge to U.S. interests.\u201d ADP Case No. 07-14939 at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 11, \n2009). \n \nForeign travel is not an enumerated disqualifying condition, and it usually has no \nindependent security significance when the travel is solely to visit relatives in the \ncountry at issue. See ISCR Case No. 02-26978 at 6 (App. Bd. Sep 21, 2005). In this \ncase, however, Applicant\u2019s frequent travel to Italy is evidence of her strong affinity for \nthe country, independent of her bonds of affection for her family.  \n \nI conclude the evidence is sufficient to raise AG \u00b6 10(a)(1) and (7), shifting the \nburden to Applicant to produce evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).   \n \n \nSecurity concerns arising from foreign preference may be mitigated if \u201cthe \nindividual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship.\u201d AG \u00b6 11(b). \nSecurity concerns based on possession or use of a foreign passport may be mitigated if \n\u201cthe passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security authority, or \notherwise invalidated.\u201d AG \u00b6 11(e). Applicant intends to retain her dual citizenship and is \nunwilling to relinquish her Italian passport. Thus, AG \u00b6\u00b6 11(b) and (e) are not \nestablished. No other enumerated mitigating conditions are established. \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant\u2019s father, mother, two brothers, and two sisters are \ncitizens and residents of Italy (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b). The security concern under this \nguideline is set out in AG \u00b6 6 as follows:  \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \n\n \n7 \n \n \nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism. \n \n \nTwo disqualifying conditions under this guideline are relevant. First, a \ndisqualifying condition may be raised by \u201ccontact with a foreign family member, \nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident \nin a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.\u201d AG \u00b6 7(a). Second, a disqualifying \ncondition may be raised by \u201cconnections to a foreign person, group, government, or \ncountry that create a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign \nperson, group, or country by providing that information.\u201d AG \u00b6 7(b). The totality of an \napplicant\u2019s family ties to a foreign country as well as each individual family tie must be \nconsidered. ISCR Case No. 01-22693 at 7 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2003). \n \n \nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States.  \u201cThe United \nStates has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information \nfrom any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, \nregardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to \nthose of the United States.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004).  \n \n \nFurthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the United \nStates over matters they view as important to their vital interests or national security. \nFinally, we know friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the United States, \nespecially in the economic, scientific, and technical fields.  See ISCR Case No. 00-\n0317, 2002 DOHA LEXIS 83 at **15-16 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2002).  Nevertheless, the \nnature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the U.S., and its human rights \nrecord are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are \nvulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is \nsignificantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family \nmember is associated with or dependent upon the government, or the country is known \nto conduct intelligence operations against the U.S. In considering the nature of the \ngovernment, an administrative judge must also consider any terrorist activity in the \ncountry at issue. See generally ISCR Case No. 02-26130 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 7, 2006) \n(reversing decision to grant clearance where administrative judge did not consider \nterrorist activity in area where family members resided). \n \n \nAG \u00b6 7(a) requires substantial evidence of a \u201cheightened risk.\u201d The \u201cheightened \nrisk\u201d required to raise this disqualifying condition is relatively low. \u201cHeightened risk\u201d \ndenotes a risk greater than the normal risk inherent in having a family member living \nunder a foreign government. Italy is an ally and close friend of the U.S., with a generally \ngood human rights record. There is no evidence that Italy conducts intelligence \noperations against the U.S. Although Italy, like the U.S., has occasional episodes of \n\n \n8 \n \n \nviolence that is politically motivated or attributable to organized crime, it remains largely \nfree of terrorist incidents. I conclude the presence of Applicant\u2019s family members in Italy \ndoes not create a \u201cheightened risk\u201d of foreign influence. Thus, I conclude AG \u00b6 7(a) is \nnot raised by the evidence. \n \n \nOn the other hand, Applicant\u2019s close affinity for Italy and her close familial \nconnections in Italy raise the possibility of a conflict of interest. Thus, I conclude AG \u00b6 \n7(b) is raised. \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe \nnature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are \nlocated, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is \nunlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the \ninterests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of \nthe U.S.\u201d AG \u00b6 8(a). Applicant\u2019s family members currently employed in governmental \npositions are not involved in making political or military decisions and are not involved in \nintelligence or military activity. The current relationship between the U.S. and Italy \nmakes it unlikely that Applicant will find herself with a conflict of interest. I conclude AG \n\u00b6 8(a) is established.  \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing \u201cthere is \nno conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the \nforeign person, group, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such \ndeep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be \nexpected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d AG \u00b6 8(b). \nApplicant\u2019s affinity for and familial connections to Italy are strong. Although the \nlikelihood of a conflict of interest is low, I am not satisfied that Applicant would resolve \nany conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. Thus, I conclude that AG \u00b6 8(b) is not \nestablished. No other enumerated mitigating conditions are relevant. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines C and B in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors \nin AG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional \ncomment. \n \n \nApplicant presented herself as a very thoughtful, intelligent, independent-minded \nperson. Although she is close to her family members in Italy, she is not easily swayed or \nintimidated. She was very candid and sincere at the hearing. She readily admitted she \nhas one foot in the U.S. and one foot in Italy. She desires to keep open the possibility of \nreturning to Italy and living there. Her unwillingness to relinquish her Italian passport, \nher regular travel to Italy, and her concession that she might retire in Italy all raise \nsecurity concerns based on foreign preference. \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline C and \nB, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has mitigated the security concerns based on foreign influence, but she has \nnot mitigated the security concerns based on foreign preference. Accordingly, I \nconclude she has not carried her burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant her eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.25: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline C (Foreign Preference): \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline B (Foreign Influence):  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \n \n \n \nLeRoy F. Foreman \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Noel, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Chester H. Morgan, II, Esquire \n \n \n \n__________ \n \nDecision \n__________ \n \nHARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: \n \nFrom about 1997 to about 1999, Applicant filed forged certifications to receive \nabout $15,000 in reserve pay. In 2004, he received mental health treatment. In 2005, \ncourt-martial charges were preferred against him. In August 2006, he failed to disclose \nthe court-martial charges and mental health treatment on his security clearance \napplication. In October 2006, he disclosed the court-martial charges and mental health \ntreatment to an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator. However, he was \nnot fully candid at his hearing and to the OPM investigator. He mitigated security \nconcerns under Guideline E; however, he failed to mitigate concerns under Guideline J \nand the whole person concept. Access to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn August 25, 2006, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) or Security Clearance Application (SF 86) \n(Government Exhibit (GE) 1). On June 19, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant, pursuant to \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated \nFebruary 20, 1960, as amended and modified; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nMarch 25, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as \namended and modified; and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by \nthe President on December 29, 2005.  \n \nThe SOR alleges security concerns under Guidelines J (criminal conduct) and E \n(personal conduct) (Hearing Exhibit (HE) 3). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA \ncould not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for \nApplicant, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether \nApplicant\u2019s clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n \nOn July 16, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge (HE 4). On January 12, 2010, Department \nCounsel was ready to proceed on Applicant\u2019s case. On January 22, 2010, DOHA \nassigned Applicant\u2019s case to me. On January 25, 2010, DOHA issued a hearing notice, \nsetting the hearing for February 9, 2010 (HE 1). The hearing was delayed. On February \n19, 2010, DOHA issued a hearing notice, setting the hearing for March 4, 2010 (HE 1). \nOn March 4, 2010, Applicant\u2019s hearing was held. At the hearing, Department Counsel \noffered eight exhibits (GE 1-8) (Tr. 11), and Applicant offered four exhibits (Tr. 15-16; \nAE A-D). There were no objections, and I admitted GE 1-8 (Tr. 11), and AE A-D (Tr. \n16). Additionally, I admitted the hearing notices, SOR, and response to the SOR (HE 1-\n4). On March 16, 2010, I received the transcript.     \n \nFindings of Fact1 \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, he admitted the conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a, 2.b, and 2.c (HE 4). He admitted that he was charged with offenses under the \nUniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), which were referred to general courts-martial \n(HE 4). He also provided clarifications and explanations about the various SOR \nsubparagraphs, and provided other mitigating information (HE 4). His admissions are \nincorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the \nevidence of record, I make the following findings of fact.   \n \nApplicant is a 57-year-old employee of a defense contractor (Tr. 17, 19).2 He has \nbeen employed doing competitive analysis since August 2002 (Tr. 18). He has one son, \nwho is in the Navy (Tr. 27). His son recently completed his second tour in Iraq (Tr. 27). \nHis son is an E-6 (Tr. 28). In August 2000, he became divorced (Tr. 28; GE 2 at 4). He \nsaid he has two adult stepdaughters (Tr. 28). \n \nThree months after graduating from high school, Applicant joined the Army (Tr. \n19). He served in the Army for 42 months as a linguist (Tr. 19). After leaving the Army, \n \n1Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits. \n  \n2Unless stated otherwise, the facts in this section are from Applicant\u2019s September 7, 2005, \nsecurity clearance application (GE 1). \n\n \n3 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nhe attended college and joined the reserve officers training corps (Tr. 20). After \ngraduation, he served in the Air Force until 1992, when he accepted a separation bonus \nand left active service (Tr. 21-23). He stayed in the Air Force reserves until 2005. In \n1994, he became a defense contractor (Tr. 26).  \n \nDriving under the influence of alcohol in 2007 \n \nOn July 21, 2007, Applicant was drinking beer and whiskey at home (Tr. 30, 66, \n73-74). His former spouse invited him to come to her residence for a visit (Tr. 29, 67). \nHe decided to drive to her residence, which was about 10 miles away (Tr. 29). He fell \nasleep or passed out while driving and went off the road (Tr. 30, 67, 71-72; GE 4). The \npolice arrested Applicant for driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI) (Tr. 29). His \nbreath-alcohol test was .174 (Tr. 114). On November 14, 2007, he pleaded guilty to \ndriving while ability impaired, and the court sentenced him to $400 in fees and costs, 48 \nhours community service, 36 hours of substance abuse training, and 15 months of \nprobation (Tr. 29-30; HE 3, 4). He does not drive after consuming alcohol (Tr. 31, 75). \nFour months ago, the breath-alcohol test device or ignition interlock device was \nremoved from his truck (Tr. 32; GE 4 at 6). He went to Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) \nmeetings for awhile; however, he has stopped his AA attendance (Tr. 75). He has not \nconsumed alcohol for about three months (Tr. 75). \n \nFalse certifications of reserve duty, court-martial charges, excess pay, and \nretirement \n \n \nIn the 1997 to 1999 timeframe, when Applicant completed reserve duty, he \nsigned an Air Force Form (AFF) 40a (Tr. 32, 36). Then his supervisor, a Lieutenant \nColonel was supposed to sign the AFF 40a, certifying that Applicant completed the \nreserve duty (Tr. 32, 34; GE 5). Then Applicant was supposed to take the certified AFF \n40a to the administrative section for processing (Tr. 32).  \n \n \nFrom November 30, 2000 to April 30, 2002, the Air Force Office of Special \nInvestigations (OSI) investigated Applicant for false official statements, forgery, and \nfrauds against the United States, in violation of Articles 107, 123, and 132, Uniform \nCode of Military Justice, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 907, 923, and 932 (GE 5). The OSI report listed \nthe loss to the government of $15,603 in pay for the dates in question (GE 5 at 3, 16). \nThe Defense Finance and Accounting Office (DFAS) is not listed as an addressee to \nreceive the OSI report of investigation (ROI) (GE 5 at 1).   \n \n \nFor six months, Applicant worked as a contractor at a location about 1,000 miles \nfrom his residence in state M (Tr. 40-41). He also performed his weekend reserve duty \nin that same vicinity (Tr. 40-41). When the Air Force investigated Applicant for \nsubmitting fraudulent claims, they were unable to locate anyone who remembered \nApplicant performing duties at his reserve location during those six months (Tr. 41). \nApplicant said he only performed about three full days of duties in state M (Tr. 42).   \n  \n\n \n4 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nApplicant was doing shift work and did not actually work with Lieutenant Colonel \nC (Tr. 33). Applicant left an AFF 40a for his supervisor to sign, and then later Applicant \nwould pick it up and take the AFF 40a to the administrative section (Tr. 33).    \n \nApplicant claimed he had some pre-signed AFF 40a\u2019s (Tr. 34). He photocopied \nthe forms (Tr. 76). He said he was authorized to fill them out and turn them in to the \nadministrative section (Tr. 34). Applicant explained: \n \n[T]he procedures we were using, the procedure we agreed upon was a \ngentleman\u2019s agreement, but it\u2019s not strictly legal. Well, I shouldn\u2019t say \n\u201clegal\u201d but it was improper. And I \u2014 I absolutely did all the time I claimed, \nand it was \u2014 but that improper agreement was an agreement between \nactive duty officers and myself. \n \nTr. 52. On October 27, 2006, Applicant told an OPM investigator under oath: \n \nOn approximately six of those requests to be paid, [Applicant] forged the \nsignature of the U.S. Army lieutenant colonel on the form.3 [Applicant] \nadvised he forged the signature of the lieutenant colonel because it was \ncommon practice to do this. [Applicant] had to do the work and it was \ndifficult to find the lieutenant colonel to have the form signed so he forged \nthe signature of the lieutenant colonel. \n \n(Tr. 77-80; GE 2 at 1-2). He initialed each page of the statement, and made corrections \non some pages of his statement (GE 2). At his hearing, however, Applicant denied that \nhe told the OPM investigators that he forged the signatures on the AFF 40a and he \ndenied that he made his supervisor\u2019s signatures on the AFF 40as (Tr. 80). He did not \nhave an explanation for why he swore, initialed, and signed the OPM investigative \nstatement (Tr. 81).   \n \nApplicant accused three active duty colonels or lieutenant colonels of allowing \nApplicant to use pre-signed AFF 40as to obtain credit for his reserve duty (Tr. 53, 76). \nApplicant emphasized the OSI never interviewed Lieutenant Colonel C (Tr. 108, 111-\n112). Applicant\u2019s lawyer never obtained a statement from Lieutenant Colonel C (Tr. \n112). None of his supervisors signed statements admitting to authorizing Applicant to fill \nout and submit AFF 40as in this manner (Tr. 110). The OSI report of investigation \nindicates three of five potential victims of forgery were interviewed and they indicated \nthey believed their signatures to be forged (Tr. 110; GE 5 at 3). Applicant never \nobtained witness statements showing he was present for duty when he claimed in state \nM (Tr. 112). Applicant denied that he fraudulently claimed hours for work he did not do \n(Tr. 35, 42, 99). Applicant also denied forging any signatures (Tr. 35, 98-99). He said \n \n3 Under military law, uttering a forged document can constitute forgery under Article 123, UCMJ. \nApplicant\u2019s lawyer has suggested that Applicant\u2019s forgery is actually by uttering an improperly completed \nAFF 40a, rather than by actually writing the certification officer\u2019s signature on the AFF 40A (Tr. 98-99).  \n \n\n \n5 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nthere was either a copied signature or an original signature on a blank AFF 40a that he \nused to file for credit for reserve duty (Tr. 35).  \n \nIn 2000, the allegations of making and submitting false claims surfaced (Tr. 52). \nThe case was delayed, and Applicant\u2019s active duty orders ended (Tr. 55). In February \n2005, Applicant was recalled to active duty for two months, and then he was released \nfrom active duty and permitted to go on excess leave (Tr. 55, 106). A September 12, \n2006 letter from the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) indicates that \nApplicant owes $9,976 for pay from May 4, 2004, to July 1, 2004, because he was in \nno-pay status (GE 7 at 1). Applicant said DFAS paid him from May 4, 2004, to July 1, \n2004, erroneously (Tr. 106). A DFAS printout indicates the $9,976 debt  \n \nis to recoup the period of 09/01/2005 to 09/30/2005 due to non-\nperformance. A review of your master pay account shows that you were \npaid for these periods, and your unit later reported that this period was not \nperformed. If you have official certification of performance of this period, \nforward it to this office for review. (GE 7).4 \n \nApplicant said he was on excess leave from September 1, 2005, to September \n30, 2005 (Tr. 55-56,105). Applicant said he tried to stop the checks while he was on \nexcess leave; however, they continued (Tr. 56). Applicant set the checks aside and did \nnot cash them until it was time to pay the money back (Tr. 56, 84). Applicant did not \nhave any documentation showing he attempted to stop the DFAS overpayments (Tr. \n82). He does not have any documentation showing he tried to pay the money back (Tr. \n83). Applicant did eventually pay the money back (Tr. 57).  \n \nApplicant said he was charged with submitting false AFF 40a\u2019s or claims, in \nviolation of Article 132, UCMJ (Tr. 76, 107). On October 27, 2006, he told an OPM \ninvestigator he was charged with conduct unbecoming an officer, a violation of Article \n133, UCMJ (GE 2). The AFF 40a\u2019s contained the names of two supervisors, Lieutenant \nColonel L and Lieutenant Colonel D (HE 3, 4). Applicant said he did not remember the \nnumber of specifications, and he did not have a copy of the charge sheet (Tr. 107). He \ndid not remember if he had an Article 32 investigation or waived it (Tr. 112-113). He \nsaid he threw all of the records away (Tr. 107). Applicant\u2019s lawyer made a motion to \ndismiss the charges based on lack of jurisdiction and the judge agreed (Tr. 53). Most \nlikely, Applicant successfully argued that the government could not prove Applicant \nsubmitted the false claims while he was on active duty; however, the precise basis for \nthe dismissal of the charges is unclear because the transcript from the trial is not part of \nthe evidence and Applicant said he was unsure of the rationale for the lack of \njurisdiction (Tr. 81-82).  \n \n \n4Despite the OSI report of investigation indicating Applicant submitted forged certifications on his \nAFF 40a\u2019s in the 1997 to 1999 time frame, Applicant said DFAS never sought repayment and there is no \nevidence that the Air Force recalculated his retirement benefit based on the findings of the OSI report of \ninvestigation (Tr. 105).  \n\n \n6 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nApplicant submitted a request to retire, and on September 12, 2005, his request \nto retire as a reserve officer was approved in the grade of lieutenant colonel (Tr. 54; HE \n4). Applicant becomes eligible to receive retired pay at age 60; however, he has to pay \nback the severance pay he received in 1992 (Tr. 54).   \n \nFalse information on security clearance application \n \nOn August 25, 2006, Applicant completed his SF 86. Section 21 asks, Your \nMedical Record. In the last 7 years, have you consulted with a mental health \nprofessional (psychiatrist, psychologist, counselor, etc.) or have you consulted with \nanother health care provider about a mental health related condition?\u201d Applicant \nanswered, \u201cNo\u201d (GE 1). From February to March 2004, Applicant was treated at a \nmental health facility (SOR \u00b6 2.a; GE 2 at 3; HE 3, 4).  \n \nApplicant said he did not disclose his mental health treatment because he did not \nbelieve his clearance would be approved (Tr. 59, 85). Applicant was committed to a \nmental treatment facility for 30 days (Tr. 60). Applicant disclosed the information to the \nOPM investigator, and he did not believe the OPM investigator was already aware of it \n(Tr. 60-61). As an inpatient, he received treatment and counseling as well as anti-\ndepressant medication (Tr. 61). After he was released from the mental health institution, \nhe was allowed to go on excess leave and return to his civilian employment (Tr. 61). \n \nOn Applicant\u2019s August 25, 2006 SF 86, Section 23 asks: \u201cYour Police Record. a. \nHave you ever been charged with or convicted of any felony offense? (Include those \nunder Uniform Code of Military Justice)\u201d and \u201ce. In the last 7 years, have you been \nsubject to court martial or other disciplinary proceedings under the Uniform Code of \nMilitary Justice? (include non-judicial, Captain\u2019s mast, etc.)\u201d (GE 1). Applicant \nanswered, \u201cNo\u201d (Tr. 90-91; GE 1; SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b, 2.c; HE 3, 4). He did not disclose his \ncourt-martial charges on his SF 86. At his hearing, he said he did not disclose the court-\nmartial charges because they were dismissed (Tr. 92). Applicant explained: \n \nI had been charged. That was\u2014that was, honestly, it was a \nmisunderstanding on my part. Because the charges were dismissed I \nviewed it as not having been\u2014been charged in the first place. You know, I \nmean, if somebody had ever explained that to me, that if you have to fill \nout an SF 86 again, yes, you have been charged, and fill out a yes. But I \ndidn\u2019t realize that, so I\u2014I said no. \n \n(Tr. 57; HE 4). On October 27, 2006, Applicant told an OPM investigator under \noath that he did not reveal the information about his court-martial charges because he \ndid not want his employer\u2019s security officer to know about it (Tr. 92-93; GE 2 at 2). \nApplicant said that he disclosed the court-martial charges at the outset of his interview \nin 2007 (Tr. 58).5 He said he made a mental list before the OPM interview of matters he \nwanted to disclose to the OPM investigator (Tr. 95-96). He did not think the OPM \n \n5Actually, the court-martial charges are discussed in his OPM interview on October 27, 2006 (GE \n2 at 1-2). \n\n \n7 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \ninvestigator was aware of the DUI, court-martial charges, or mental health treatment \nprior to his interview (Tr. 95). He disclosed his DUI, mental health treatment, and court-\nmartial charges to the OPM investigator (Tr. 31). The investigator did not have the \nprivacy waiver forms, which is an indication he did not already know about the \nallegations (Tr. 58-59). He said he never intended to deceive anyone and he did not \ndefraud the government (Tr. 115). \n \nWhen the investigation began concerning the submission of false claims, \nApplicant\u2019s clearance was revoked and it was never restored (Tr. 96). The government \ntook his badges and denied him access to the building where he worked (Tr. 102). He \nwas not allowed access to places where classified information was stored or used (Tr. \n102-103). However, Applicant erroneously failed to indicate that his clearance was \ndenied, suspended, or revoked in response to Section 26 (Tr. 96-97; GE 1). The SOR \ndid not allege he failed to disclose on his SF 86 the denial, suspension, or revocation of \nhis security clearance (HE 3).  \n \nApplicant has held a security clearance in the past beginning in the early 1970s \n(Tr. 84-85). He was very familiar with the security clearance process and completion of \nsecurity clearance applications (Tr. 84-86). He was well aware of the purpose of \ncompletion of security clearance applications and nevertheless deliberately chose not to \nreveal relevant information on his SF 86 (Tr. 86-87). At the time he completed his SF \n86, he was unsure whether he would be interviewed (Tr. 88, 89). The security office was \naware of Applicant\u2019s mental health treatment (Tr. 89). On October 27, 2006, Applicant \ntold an OPM investigator under oath that he did not reveal the information about his \nmental health treatment because he did not want the security officer at his employer to \nknow about it due to embarrassment (Tr. 90; GE 2 at 3). However, he provided a \nstatement from his supervisor indicating he knew about Applicant\u2019s court-martial \ncharges and mental health treatment because Applicant kept him informed of his status \n(Tr. 90, 100-101; AE C). His supervisor informed the security office and personnel \nofficer about Applicant\u2019s status and charges (AE C). He attributed the errors in his OPM \nstatement to careless mistakes and asserted there was no intent to deceive (Tr. 90-94).     \n \n \n \nApplicant is not concerned about public disclosure of the information about his \npast (Tr. 64). He would not compromise classified information to avoid disclosure of his \npast conduct or psychiatric treatment (Tr. 64-65).     \n \nApplicant\u2019s officer evaluation or effectiveness reports document his contributions \nto the national defense over more than 20 years (AE D). They also show his law-abiding \ncharacter and integrity (AE D). \n  \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \n\n \n8 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, \nnothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, \nin whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to applicant\u2019s allegiance, \nloyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict \nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a \nclearance. \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n\n \n9 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security \nconcerns are under Guidelines J (criminal conduct) and E (personal conduct).  \n \nCriminal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct, \u201cCriminal \nactivity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its \nnature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules \nand regulations.\u201d AG \u00b6 31 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case:  \n \n(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses; and  \n \n(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the \nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted. \n \nAGs \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and 31(c) apply because from about 1997 to about 1999, Applicant \nsubmitted forged certifications and received about $15,000 from DFAS. There was \nsufficient evidence to cite him in an OSI report, prefer charges, and refer those charges \nto general court-martial. On July 21, 2007, Applicant drove while under the influence of \nalcohol (DUI). On October 27, 2006, Applicant signed a confession to forging his \nsupervisor\u2019s signature on the certification document. He received mental health \ntreatment in February to March 2004. When he completed his SF 86 on August 25, \n2006, he falsely denied that he had had court-martial charges preferred against him and \nmental health treatment, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001. He admitted he deliberately \nfailed to disclose this information on his SF 86. Although Applicant was not convicted of \nany offenses except for DUI, there is substantial evidence he committed these three \ncriminal offenses.    \n \nAG \u00b6 32 provides four conditions that could potentially mitigate security concerns: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n \n(b) the person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those \npressures are no longer present in the person's life; \n \n(c) evidence that the person did not commit the offense; and \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \n\n \n10 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or \nconstructive community involvement. \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions fully apply to all of the offenses. AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(b) \nand 32(c) do not apply because Applicant admitted the offenses and no one pressured \nhim into committing the offenses. AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and 32(d) are similar and partially \napplicable. Applicant's earliest offenses, the 1997 to 1999 forgeries and presenting \nforged documents, occurred more than 10 years ago. This offense is mitigated by the \npassage of time (SOR \u00b6 1.b).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s July 21, 2007, DUI is mitigated because of Applicant\u2019s extensive \nmitigating efforts. He paid his fine, served his community service, and completed his \nprobation. He presented strong evidence of remorse, job training, and a good \nemployment record. His demonstrated intent not to commit future crimes is \nencompassed in these two mitigating conditions. He has accepted responsibility and \nculpability for his DUI. I am convinced he will not commit any future DUIs (SOR \u00b6 1.a).  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c alleges Applicant wrongfully accepted payment of $10,557. This \nallegation is not substantiated, and is therefore mitigated under AG \u00b6 32(c).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s deliberate falsification of his August 25, 2006 SF 86 is more \nproblematic. He deliberately and intentionally falsified his SF 86 by not disclosing his \nmental health treatment and court-martial charges because he wanted to deceive the \ngovernment into giving him a security clearance. He understood the importance of \nproviding accurate information on his 2006 SF 86. He was not fully truthful at his \nhearing and when he made a statement to an OPM investigator on October 27, 2006.6 \nHe said that he did not disclose his court-martial charges because they were dismissed. \nI do not believe this was his true rationale for failing to disclose this derogatory \ninformation at the time he completed his SF 86. As a lieutenant colonel with charges \nreferred to general court-martial, and clearly an experienced and intelligent person, he \nwas aware of the difference between never being charged and being charged and then \nhaving those charges dismissed, especially without a determination of his culpability. He \nknew the referral of court-martial charges for fraudulent activity, less than two years \nbefore he completed his SF 86, was highly relevant information.   \n \n6The SOR did not allege that Applicant failed to disclose the suspension or revocation of his \nsecurity clearance on his 2006 SF 86. The SOR did not allege that he provided false information to the \nOPM investigator about why he failed to disclose his court-martial charges on his SF 86. In ISCR Case \nNo. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) the Appeal Board listed five circumstances in which conduct \nnot alleged in an SOR may be considered stating:  \n \n(a) to assess an applicant\u2019s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant\u2019s evidence of \nextenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether an applicant \nhas demonstrated successful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular provision of \nthe Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person \nanalysis under Directive Section 6.3.  \n \n(citing ISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-0633 at 3 (App. Bd. \nOct. 24, 2003)). I have considered the non-SOR misconduct for the five above purposes. \n\n \n11 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nMore progress is necessary to assure Applicant has the reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment necessary to safeguard classified information. His \nfailure to be fully candid and forthright at his hearing about his frame of mind when he \ncompleted his SF 86, shows poor judgment and militates against approval of a security \nclearance. His minimization of his culpability when he forged the certifications, as \nopposed to his more credible admissions to an OPM investigator, also shows poor \njudgment. At his hearing, he accused several of his supervisors of lying to the OSI or \nfailing to disclose that they gave him permission to submit certifications with their \nsignatures on the documents without their review of the completed documents. I do not \nfind his statements about having their permission to violate the certification rules to be \ncredible. He did not want to accept full responsibility for his misconduct.   \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying with respect to the alleged falsifications of documents used to process the \nadjudication of Applicant\u2019s security clearance in this case: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning \nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent \nmedical authority, or other official government representative.7 \n \n7The Appeal Board has cogently explained the process for analyzing falsification cases, stating:\n \n(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has the burden of \nproving falsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove \nan applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the omission occurred; and (c) a Judge must \nconsider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or \ncircumstantial evidence concerning the applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the \nomission occurred. [Moreover], it was legally permissible for the Judge to conclude \nDepartment Counsel had established a prima facie case under Guideline E and the \nburden of persuasion had shifted to the applicant to present evidence to explain the \nomission.  \n \n\n \n12 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                                                                                                                            \nOn August 25, 2006, Applicant signed his SF 86. He falsely denied that he did \nnot receive mental health treatment, and he did not have any court-martial charges. \nApplicant knew he was an inpatient for mental health treatment for a month in February-\nMarch 2004. He knew he had been charged and his charges were referred to general \ncourt-martial. He had sufficient military experience, and knowledge of security clearance \nmatters to realize the significance of providing accurate information on his SF 86. His \nstatement that he did not know the court-martial charges were reportable on his security \nclearance application is not credible. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) and 16(b) apply. \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides seven conditions that could mitigate security concerns in this \ncase: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress;  \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or \noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules \nand regulations. \n  \n \nISCR Case No. 03-10380 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 6, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-23133 (App. Bd. June 9, \n2004)). \n\n \n13 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nAG \u00b6 17(a) fully applies to the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a to 2.c. On October 8, \n2006, Applicant disclosed his mental health treatment and court-martial charges to an \nOPM investigator, which constituted a prompt, good-faith effort to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts.  \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.d alleges Applicant admitted to an OPM investigator that he deliberately \nlied when failed to disclose the court-martial charges and mental health treatment on his \nSF 86. SOR \u00b6 2.d essentially alleges the mitigating conduct in AG \u00b6 17(a), and as such \nis unsubstantiated as a disqualifying condition.   \n \nAG \u00b6 17(e) applies. Applicant has disclosed his court-martial charges and his \nmental health treatment to his employer and security officials. He has eliminated the \npossibility that he will be exploited, or manipulated by disclosure to the public of this \ninformation.  \n  \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines J and E in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) \nwere addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nThere is some evidence supporting approval of Applicant\u2019s access to classified \ninformation. He has only committed two criminal offenses involving judicial action. He \nsubmitted forged certifications in about 1997 and about 1999 to received about $15,000 \nin reserve pay, and he committed a DUI on July 21, 2007. The first offense is not recent, \nand the second offense is mitigated through his rehabilitative efforts. He served on \nactive and reserve duty for more than 20 years and received positive supporting \nendorsements from his rating chain. Applicant significantly contributed to the national \ndefense. Reliable military personnel serving with him laud his duty performance and \ncontributions to mission accomplishment. He has made contributions to national \nsecurity. All these circumstances demonstrate that Applicant will recognize, resist, and \n\n \n14 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nreport any attempts by a foreign power, terrorist group, or insurgent group at coercion or \nexploitation. There is no evidence of disloyalty. There is no evidence that he would \nintentionally violate national security, or that he would deliberately fail to safeguard \nsensitive or classified information. His character and good work performance show \nsubstantial responsibility, rehabilitation, and mitigation.    \n \nThe evidence against approval of Applicant\u2019s clearance is more substantial.  The \nimportance of providing accurate information on a security clearance application is \nmanifest. It is even more important that an applicant provide accurate information at his \nor her security clearance hearing. Applicant received notice in the SOR that the \nDepartment of Defense might deny his clearance because in the past he was not \ntruthful and candid when he denied or omitted potentially disqualifying information from \nhis security clearance application. Nevertheless, he intentionally and falsely denied at \nhis hearing that was aware he was required to report his court-martial charges, \nasserting he thought they were not reportable because they were dismissed. I also \nbelieve, contrary to his statement at his hearing, and consistent with his statement to \nthe OPM investigator, that he forged the signatures of his supervisors on some of his \ncertification statements. At his hearing, he had an opportunity to correct his previous \nfalse statement to the OPM investigator about his rationale for failing to disclose his \ncourt-martial charges, and to admit that he intentionally provided false information on \nhis security clearance application about why he failed to disclose his court-martial \ncharges. Instead, he continued his pattern of failing to take full responsibility for his \nconduct. \n \nApplicant\u2019s false statement on his 2006 SF 86 that he was not charged with \nfelony-level court-martial charges constituted a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001. Even if \nthis felonious false statement was mitigated because of his disclosure of the court-\nmartial charges to an OPM investigator on October 27, 2006, I would not mitigate his \nconduct under the whole person concept because of his failure to be completely candid \nat his hearing. Applicant failed to disclose on his August 25, 2006 SF 86 that his \nsecurity clearance was suspended or revoked when he was investigated for filing false \ncertifications of his reserve duty. He did not disclose the suspension of his security \nclearance to the OPM investigator on October 27, 2006. Applicant is 57 years old and \nsufficiently mature to be fully responsible for his conduct. His false statements show \nlack of judgment and a failure to abide by the law. Such conduct establishes a serious \nsecurity concern, and access to classified information is not warranted at this time. After \nweighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and circumstances \nin the context of the whole person, I conclude he has mitigated the security concerns \npertaining to personal conduct for the reasons stated under that adjudicative guideline. \nHowever, he has not mitigated the security concerns relating to criminal conduct.     \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d8 and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \n \n8See ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd. June 28, 2006).  \n\n \n15 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nhas not mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I \nconclude he is not currently eligible for access to classified information.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:   \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.c: \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:    \n \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a to 2.d: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nMARK HARVEY \nAdministrative Judge \n",

He is employed by a defense contractor as an Engineering Manager, and is applying for a security clearance in connection with his employment. Paragraph 1 (Guideline J - Criminal Conduct). The Government alleges that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he engaged in criminal conduct. Paragraph 2 (Guideline H - Drug Involvement). The Government alleges that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he abuses illegal drugs. The Applicant denied each of the allegations set forth under these guidelines. He has held a security clearance since 1982/83, and has never had a security violation. (Tr. p. 74). The Applicant explained that in 2002, he was going through a horrible divorce and child custody battle.

Howry, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Alan V. Edmunds, Attorney At Law\nMarch 31, 2010\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLOKEY ANDERSON, Darlene D., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Questionnaire for Sensitive Positions (SF-86) on October\n7, 2007.  (Government Exhibit 1).  On March 30, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings\nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security\nconcerns under Guidelines J, E and H for Applicant. The action was taken under\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February\n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended\n(Directive), and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on\nDecember 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued\nafter September 1, 2006. \n \nThe Applicant responded to the SOR on April 30, 2009, and he requested a\nhearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.  This case was originally assigned to\nanother Administrative Judge on October 2, 2009.  The matter was transferred to the\nundersigned on October 19, 2009.  That same day, a notice of hearing was issued\nscheduling the hearing for November 10, 2009.  At the hearing the Government\npresented four exhibits, referred to Government Exhibits 1 to 4.  The Applicant called\nthree witnesses and presented seventeen exhibits, referred to as Applicant's Exhibits A\n\n2\nthrough Q.  He also testified on his own behalf.  The official transcript (Tr.) was received\non November 19, 2009.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and\ntestimony, eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe Applicant is 49 years old and unmarried.  He is employed by a defense\ncontractor as an Engineering Manager, and is applying for a security clearance in\nconnection with his employment.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline J - Criminal Conduct).  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he engaged in criminal conduct.\nParagraph 2 (Guideline H - Drug Involvement). The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he abuses illegal drugs.\nThe Applicant denied each of the allegations set forth under these guidelines.\nHe has held a security clearance since 1982/83, and has never had a security violation. \n(Tr. p. 74).  \nThe Applicant explained that in 2002, he was going through a horrible divorce\nand child custody battle.  During the process, his ex-wife engaged in many\nunscrupulous tactics in an effort to malign his character and place him in a false light\nbefore the court.  She wanted custody of the children and the child support that went\nwith it.  Among many false allegations, she accused him of being a drug addict.  The\nresults of the tribulations eventually brought about the divorce, and he was granted full\ncustody of their two children.  \nIn October 2002, the Applicant was arrested for (1) Driving Under the Influence of\na Controlled Substance and (2) Domestic Violence, Non-Criminal.  (Applicant's Exhibit\nA).  The charges were dismissed.  Applicant explained that he and his wife had been\narguing about who their children should live with.  The Applicant did come home after\nwork, but was waiting until his wife left for work to do so.  He noticed a friend of his wife\nfollowing him.  When he came home, his wife had taken their two children to a friend\u2019s\nhouse.  She then called 911 reporting that the Applicant had pulled the telephones our\nof the wall and was threatening her with a gun.  Applicant was upstairs getting ready for\nbed when the telephone rang and the sheriff\u2019s department ordered him to come out with\nhis hands up and guns were pointed at him. Applicant was then taken into custody and\narrested.   Applicant was given a drug test, it was determined that he was not under the\ninfluence, and the charges were dismissed.  (Tr. p. 64-65).    \nThree months later, in January 2003, the Applicant was arrested for violation of a\nProtective Order for an incident the occurred in December 2002.  Applicant testified that\nin December 2002, while at his son's basketball game, his wife came in and sat behind\nhim.  She then followed him to his car and called 911, reporting that he had violated the\nongoing Protective Order requiring that he remain at least 100 yards away from her.\n\n3\nThe Applicant discovered that his car had been keyed and he suspected that his wife\nhad done it.  A month later, he was arrested.  The matter was subsequently dismissed.  \nIn June 2007, the Applicant was arrested for Possession of Marijuana.  He\nexplained that his brother had called him from a bar to come pick him.  Applicant went\ninto the bar and had a few beers.  He then drove his brother home.  On his way home,\nhe pulled over to use his cell phone and did not realize that he had pulled over at the\naqueduct entrance.  At that point, he noticed something floating around in his car that\nhad fallen to the floor.  He picked it up and realized that it was marijuana.  He then\ntucked the bag in his pocket, with the intent of returning it to his brother.  A sheriff\nquickly pulled up shining his light on the car and saw another bag of marijuana in the\nseat.  Applicant was then arrested.  Applicant stated that none of the marijuana was not\nhis and he did not know it had been stashed in his car.  Applicant later learned that the\nmarijuana was his brothers.  Applicant hired an attorney to represent him in hopes of\ngetting the case dismissed.  For a first offender, he was required to attended 24\nNarcotics Anonymous meetings and the charge was dismissed.  Applicant has satisfied\nthe courts requirement.  (Applicant's Exhibit E).  In hopes of getting the charge\ndismissed, the Applicant did not immediately report the incident to his Facility Security\nOfficer.  Approximately a month after the incident, the Applicant reported the arrest to\nhis Facility Security Officer.  \nApplicant's brother testified that on the evening in question in June 2007, he had\nbeen consuming alcohol at a bar.  While at the bar, he purchased marijuana from a\nfriend.  He called his brother, the Applicant, to come pick him up to give him a ride\nhome.  Once in the Applicant's car, he stashed the marijuana down the side of the seat.\nHe did not tell the Applicant about it, and inadvertently left it in the Applicant's vehicle.\nApplicant's brother further testified that the Applicant, to his knowledge, has never used\nmarijuana.  (Tr. pp. 42-45)    \nApplicant presented a written statement of intent under penalty of perjury stating\nthat he has no intentions to ever use illegal drugs of any sort, and if he does his security\nclearance will be subject to immediate revocation.  (Applicant's Exhibit Q).\nParagraph 3 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct).  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he intentionally falsified material aspects of\nhis personal background during the clearance screening process.\nIn 1982, the Applicant completed a security clearance application, and did not\ndisclose his infrequent use of marijuana in college from 1978 to 1981 on the application.\nApplicant admits that he answered the question falsely, but argues that he was young\nand did not understand the seriousness of falsifying the document at the time.  He is\nnow much more mature and understands the implications of his actions.  He has not\nused marijuana or any other drug since then.  He also more fully understands the\nresponsibility of being honest and candid with the Government at all times.    \nApplicant's Program Manager and a past supervisor, who have both evaluated\nhis Applicant's work performance for several years between the period from 2001\n\n4\nthrough 2007, testified that Applicant is a wonderful worker, who has always received\ngood ratings at the \"meets\" or \"exceeds\" company standards.  They consider the\nApplicant sufficiently trustworthy for access to classified information.  (Tr. pp. 32-34).\nApplicant's  experience, great knowledge and technical expertise, have been the\nreasons he was promoted from Flight Test to take the Lead position overseas.  (Tr. p.\n55).  \nApplicant's work performance evaluations for 2006 through 2008, overall reflect\nthat he \"meets\" or \"exceeds requirements\".  (Applicant's Exhibit H).  Applicant has also\nreceived a number of achievement awards for his work performance.  (Applicant's\nExhibit I).\nFour letters of recommendation from individuals who have worked with the\nApplicant and/or know him well, attest to his hard working nature, dedication to his job\nand reliability.  They describe him as professional, a good team leader, with excellent\ntechnical abilities, integrity and loyalty, and a person of high ethics.  (Applicant's Exhibits\nB, C, F and K). \n   \nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies\ndivided into \"Disqualifying Factors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying\nFactors and Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:\nGuideline J (Criminal Conduct)\n30.  The Concern.  Criminal activity creates a doubt about a person's judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness.  By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n31.(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses;\n31.(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the\nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted.\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n32.(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not\ncast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;\n32.(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to\nthe passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job\n\n5\ntraining or higher education, good employment record, or constructive community\ninvolvement.\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct)\n15.  The Concern.  Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers\nduring the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security\nclearance process.\nCondition that could raise a security concern:\n16.(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any\npersonnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to\nconduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities.\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n17.(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so\ninfrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\nGuideline H (Drug Involvement)\n24.  The Concern. Use of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise\nquestions about an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may\nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person's ability or willingness\nto comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n25.(a) any drug abuse;\n25.(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture,\npurchase, sale or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia;\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n26.(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under\nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual's\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;\n26.(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any illegal drugs in the future, such as:\n\n6\n(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for\nany violation.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 18-19,  in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\na.  The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct;\nb. The circumstances surrounding the conduct;\nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct;\nd.  The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct;\ne.  The extent to which participation is voluntary;\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavior\nchanges;\ng.  The motivation for the conduct; \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress; and \ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \"clearly consistent with the\nnational interest\" to grant an Applicant's request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \"The adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\nan acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicated\nupon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative\nprocess is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person\nconcept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable\nand unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\" The Administrative\nJudge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record. \nThe Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence which is\nspeculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in\nExecutive Order 10865, \"Any determination under this order . . . shall be a\ndetermination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination\nas to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned.\"\n\n7\nCONCLUSION\nIn the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to\ncivilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information\ntwenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore\nappropriately concerned when available information indicates that an Applicant for\nclearance may be involved in criminal conduct, drug abuse and/or dishonesty that\ndemonstrates poor judgment or unreliability.\nIt is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant's conduct and the\ncontinued holding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the\nburden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation\nor mitigation, which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government's case.  The\nApplicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant him a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the\nApplicant has engaged in criminal conduct, (Guideline J) that he falsified his security\nclearance application (Guideline E), and he engaged in drug abuse, (Guideline H).  The\ntotality of this evidence indicates poor judgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on\nthe part of the Applicant.  Because of the scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I\nconclude there is a nexus or connection with his security clearance eligibility.\nConsidering all of the evidence, the Applicant has introduced persuasive evidence in\nrebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the Government's case\nunder Guidelines J, E and H of the SOR.\nThe evidence shows that while going through a bad divorce and custody battle,\nhe  was arrested and charged with Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol, Domestic\nViolence, violating a Protective Order, and Possession of a Controlled Substance.  All of\nthe charges were dismissed.  Two of the arrests occurred over seven years ago.  The\nmost recent occurred over three years ago.  Applicant fully explained the circumstances\nconcerning each incident and has provided persuasive evidence demonstrating that he\nhas put any such misconduct behind him.  He currently displays good judgment and\ntrustworthiness. \nUnder Guideline J, Criminal Conduct, Disqualifying Conditions, 31.(a) a single\nserious crime or multiple lesser offenses, and 31.(c) allegation or admission of criminal\nconduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or\nconvicted apply.  However, Mitigating Conditions 32.(a) so much time has elapsed since\nthe criminal behavior happened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that\nit is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment, and 32.(d) there is evidence of successful\nrehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time without recurrence of\ncriminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher education, good\nemployment record, or constructive community involvement also apply.  Under the\nparticular facts of this case, the Applicant's criminal conduct is in the distant past.  The\n\n8\ninstigators of the conduct have been removed from his life, and there is no chance that\nhe will engage in any such conduct in the future.  \nWith respect to the Applicant's failure to disclose his use of marijuana use on his\n1982 security clearance application, I find that it was intentional.  At that time, he was\nobviously too young and immature to meet security clearance eligibility.  However, given\nthe time that has passed, twenty-six years, without reoccurrence of the drug abuse or\nincidents of dishonesty, I find that the falsification is no longer of security significance.\nApplicant now understands the significance of holding a security clearance and the\nresponsibilities that come with it.  \nUnder Guideline E, Personal Conduct, Disqualifying Condition, 16.(a) deliberate\nomission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security\nquestionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct\ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities applies.  However, Mitigating Condition, 17.(c) the offense is so minor,\nor so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such\nunique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment also applies.  Under Guideline\nH, Drug Involvement, Disqualifying Conditions 25.(a) any drug abuse, 25.(c) illegal drug\npossession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale or\ndistribution, or possession of drug paraphernalia, apply.  However, Mitigating Conditions\n26.(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual's\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment, and 26.(b) a demonstrated intent\nnot to abuse any illegal drugs in the future, such as: (4) a signed statement of intent with\nautomatic revocation of clearance for any violation also apply.  Accordingly, I find for the\nApplicant under Guidelines J, Criminal Conduct, and H, Drug Involvement. \nAs stated above, I find that the Applicant deliberately falsified his security\nclearance application by concealing his marijuana use.  However, he has not used\nmarijuana for over twenty six years and has no intentions of ever using it again.  Under\nthe particular circumstances of this case, his past conduct no longer has security\nsignificance.  Accordingly, I find for the Applicant under Guideline E, Personal Conduct. \nI have also considered the \"whole person concept\" in evaluating the Applicant's\neligibility for access to classified information.  Under the particular facts of this case, the\ntotality of the conduct set forth under all of the guidelines viewed as a whole, support a\nwhole person assessment of good judgment, trustworthiness, reliability, candor and a\nwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, and/or other characteristics indicating\nthat the person may properly safeguard classified information.  \nThis Applicant has demonstrated that he is trustworthy, and meets the eligibility\nrequirements for access to classified information.  Accordingly, I find for the Applicant\nunder Guidelines J (Criminal Conduct),  H (Drug Involvement), and E (Personal\nConduct).  \n\n9\nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has overcome the Government's\ncase opposing his request for a  security clearance.  Accordingly, the evidence supports\na finding for the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary allegations expressed in\nParagraphs 1,  2 and 3 of the SOR.               \n                                                                                                                \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as required\nby Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: For the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.b.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.c.:\nFor the Applicant.\nParagraph 2: For the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  2.a.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  2.b.:\nFor the Applicant.\nParagraph 3: For the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  3.a.:\nFor the Applicant.\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant.\nDarlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact2 Applicant denied all of the SOR allegations in her SOR response without elaboration (GE 11). She did not make any admissions. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant\u2019s statement of reasons (SOR) listed 22 delinquent debts totaling $18,872. She has made $300 payments in August, September and October 2009, to address one SOR debt (Tr. 75-76). She has not made any other payments to any of her other SOR creditors. Applicant is a 60-year-old employee of a defense contractor (Tr. 7). She has been continuously employed by the same employer since June 1996 (Tr. 32; GE 1). From June 2005 to June 2006, she was employed by another large defense contractor (GE 1 at 3). Her primary work for the last several years has been as a software trainer. From January 2005 to June 2005, she was employed by another corporation (GE 1 at 3).

Hoffman, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n__________ \n \nDecision \n__________ \n \nHARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant failed to mitigate trustworthiness concerns regarding her delinquent \ndebts under Guideline F (financial considerations). She failed to adequately mitigate \neight debts totaling $15,012. Applicant\u2019s eligibility to occupy a public trust position is \ndenied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn June 25, 2005, Applicant completed a Questionnaire for Public Trust \nPositions (SF 85P) (Government Exhibit (GE) 2). On March 23, 2009, she completed an \nSF 85P (GE 1). On May 18, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to her (GE 10), pursuant to Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended, modified and revised; \nDepartment of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program, dated \n \n1 Department Counsel noted the case was an ADP case rather than an ISCR case. With consent \nof the parties, I changed the statement of reasons to indicate the case is an ADP case (Tr. 15-16). \nDecember 31, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nJan. 1987, as amended (Regulation); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005.  \n \nThe SOR alleges trustworthiness concerns under Guideline F (financial \nconsiderations). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary \naffirmative finding under the Regulation that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility to occupy a public trust position, which \nentails access to sensitive information. DOHA recommended referral to an \nadministrative judge to determine whether such access to sensitive information should \nbe granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n \nOn March 20, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations (GE 11). On \nSeptember 3, 2009, Department Counsel indicated he was ready to proceed. On \nSeptember 14, 2009, DOHA issued a hearing notice (GE 9). On October 14, 2009, the \nhearing was held as scheduled. At the hearing, Department Counsel offered eight \nexhibits (GE 1-8) (Tr. 19-22), and Applicant offered seven exhibits (Tr. 27-30; AE A-G). \nApplicant objected to the admissibility of four credit reports because she had \nsuccessfully disputed the accuracy of the credit reports (Tr. 22; GE 4-7; AG F). I \nadmitted the documents and noted the information about the successful disputes went \nto the weight rather than to the admissibility of documents (Tr. 24). There were no other \nobjections, and I admitted GE 1-8 (Tr. 24), and AE A-G (Tr. 30). Additionally, I admitted \nthe SOR, response to the SOR, and hearing notice (GE 9-11). I received the transcript \non October 22, 2009. On December 15, 2009, Department Counsel forwarded AE H to \nZ to me without objection, and I admitted AE H to Z into evidence.  I closed the record \non December 16, 2009. \n \nFindings of Fact2 \n \nApplicant denied all of the SOR allegations in her SOR response without \nelaboration (GE 11). She did not make any admissions. After a complete and thorough \nreview of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact.   \n \nApplicant\u2019s statement of reasons (SOR) listed 22 delinquent debts totaling \n$18,872. She has made $300 payments in August, September and October 2009, to \naddress one SOR debt (Tr. 75-76). She has not made any other payments to any of her \nother SOR creditors.  \n \nApplicant is a 60-year-old employee of a defense contractor (Tr. 7). She has \nbeen continuously employed by the same employer since June 1996 (Tr. 32; GE 1). \nFrom June 2005 to June 2006, she was employed by another large defense contractor \n(GE 1 at 3). Her primary work for the last several years has been as a software trainer. \nFrom January 2005 to June 2005, she was employed by another corporation (GE 1 at \n3). She has never served in the military (Tr. 34; GE 2).  \n \n2Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nIn 1967, Applicant graduated from high school (Tr. 7). She attended college from \n1967 to 1971 and majored in education (Tr. 8; GE 2). She subsequently completed \nsufficient college courses to maintain her teaching certificate (Tr. 32). She has not \nreceived a degree (Tr. 8, 37). She erroneously indicated on her 2005 SF 85P that she \nhad a bachelor of arts degree (Tr. 37; GE 2). The college she attended from 1967 to \n1971 has closed and she does not have her transcript (Tr. 38). She does not have the \nability to corroborate her attendance at college from 1967 to 1971 (Tr. 38). She has \nnever held a security clearance (Tr. 9). \n \nApplicant married in 1986, and she was divorced in 1988 (Tr. 7). She married the \nsecond time in 1989, and she was divorced in 1992 (Tr. 8).3 She has one child, a son, \nwho is 38 years old (Tr. 8; GE 2).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s file does not include any adverse information about her being fired \nfrom a job, leaving employment under adverse circumstances, or relating to police \ninvolvement. For example, there is no evidence she has ever been charged with a \nfelony or any firearms or explosives offense(s), or that she has any currently pending \ncharges. There is no evidence she has ever been charged with any offense related to \nalcohol or drugs. There is no evidence that she has abused alcohol or drugs. In the \nfinancial information section of her March 23, 2009, SF 85P, she disclosed that she had \ndebts currently delinquent over 90 days, and debts delinquent over 180 days in the last \nseven years (GE 1). She attached a credit report and a statement in which she denied \nreceiving notice of her delinquent debts and a judgment. Applicant did not list any \nperiods of unemployment in the last 12 years (GE 1, 2).     \n \nFinancial considerations \n \nThe SOR listed 22 delinquent debts, totaling $18,872 as follows: \u00b6 1.a ($169); \u00b6 \n1.b ($5,732); \u00b6 1.c ($1,410); \u00b6 1.d ($98); \u00b6 1.e ($3,250); \u00b6 1.f ($329); \u00b6 1.g ($188); \u00b6 1.h \n($1,238); \u00b6 1.i ($3,713); \u00b6 1.j ($471); \u00b6 1.k ($421); \u00b6 1.l ($266); \u00b6 1.m ($249); \u00b6 1.n \n($207); \u00b6 1.o ($40); \u00b6 1.p ($152); \u00b6 1.q ($110); \u00b6 1.r ($87); \u00b6 1.s ($151); \u00b6 1.t ($60); \u00b6 \n1.u ($139); and \u00b6 1.v ($392). \n \nIn the last few years, Applicant has never been unemployed for a significant \nperiod of time, and she has received a good salary (Tr. 129-130). She has traveled \nfrequently for work and did not take the time to ensure her creditors were paid or \ndisputed debts were resolved (Tr. 130). She had to move after she lost her last job, and \nthe move was expensive (Tr. 130). \n  \nApplicant contacted the credit reporting companies and disputed her delinquent \ndebts (Tr. 46). On February 17, 2009, TransUnion stated that Applicant had previously \ndisputed her debts with respect the account in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i ($3,713) and 1.k ($421) (AE \nB). Because her latest dispute did not include any new information, TransUnion \n \n3At her hearing Applicant said she was married twice to the same man, and once to another man \n(Tr. 60). When she completed her 2005 and 2009 SF 85Ps, she indicated she was divorced; however, \nshe did not list the name of her former spouse or the dates of her marriages or divorces (GE 1, GE 2).  \n\n \n4 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nconsidered the dispute to be frivolous (AE B). She did not provide any letters from \nTransUnion indicating any account information was disputed and removed from her \ncredit reports. \n \nCredit repair company (KCCS) \n \nOn September 23, 2008, Applicant signed an agreement with a credit repair \ncompany (KCCS) (AE K). She said she paid KCCS $1,000 to assist with correction of \nher credit reports (Tr. 48, 58, 126-127; GE 3 at 16; AE F).4 She provided her social \nsecurity number to KCCS (Tr. 59). She received an undated and unsigned letter from \nKCCS, advising Applicant that they had successfully removed 14 inaccurate items from \nher credit report (Tr. 48; AE F at 1). In October 2009, Applicant asked KCCS for a list of \nthe corrections (Tr. 47-48, 70). At her hearing, she conceded she had not set up any \npayment plans, except for the three payments to the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.h (Tr. 109). \nShe planned to change to a different credit repair company after she obtains the \ninformation about the inaccurate credit reports (Tr. 126, 151). I requested that she \nprovide a copy of her contract with KCCS after her hearing, and she provided part of it \n(Tr. 70-71, 146; AE K).5 Her KCCS contract does not authorize KCCS to negotiate with \ncreditors to set up payment plans, and is focused on removing obsolete or incorrect \ninformation from credit reports (AE K). Information is obsolete under the Fair Credit \nReporting Act after seven years (AE K at 3).  \n \nOn October 19, 2009, KCCS sent Applicant a brief email listing her debts and \ncreditors. The KCCS email listed five creditors and seven accounts (AE L). All five \ncreditors were listed on the SOR. The KCCS email did not provide specific information \nabout the amounts owed on those seven accounts or the account numbers for the \nseven accounts (AE L). The documentation from creditors or credit reporting companies \nsupporting the KCCS email was not provided. \n  \nSOR \u00b6 1.a ($169)\u2014SUBSTANTIATED, UNRESOLVED DEBT. Applicant\u2019s \nSeptember 20, 2007, and August 17, 2008, credit reports list a revolving credit card \naccount opened in 1993 with a balance of $169 (Tr. 42-45; GE 6 at 4; GE 3 at 37). The \ncreditor charged off $169 in July 2001 (GE 6 at 4). Applicant called this creditor and \nseveral others, and the creditors asked for Applicant\u2019s social security number to verify \nher identity (Tr. 44). Applicant declined to provide her social security number and the \ncreditor declined to provide information about Applicant\u2019s account (Tr. 44, 57-58). She \nwanted to verify that she signed a contract for a credit card with the creditor (Tr. 55). \nShe denied that she had an account with the creditor, and said she reviewed her \ncheckbook and was unable to locate any payments to the account (Tr. 55). \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b ($5,732)\u2014SUBSTANTIATED, UNRESOLVED DEBT. This debt \nrelated to business expenses charged on Applicant\u2019s credit card in 2005 and 2006 \nduring her employment that ended in June 2006 (Tr. 88-90; GE 1). Applicant charged \n \n4Applicant did not provide documentary proof of any payments to KCCS.   \n \n5The information from KCCS did not indicate how much she was supposed to pay KCCS (AE K).   \n\n \n5 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nabout $5,500 on a credit card, which was never paid. In 2006 and 2005, Applicant went \non numerous work-related trips (Tr. 39; GE 3 at 42-66). Her employer was supposed to \npay the creditor directly (Tr. 89). On November 25, 2006, Applicant emailed her \ncorporate supervisor and asked for help with two discrepancies, including one for \n$5,000, that were related to her travel account (Tr. 89-90; GE 3 at 44). On November \n28, 2006, her supervisor provided very detailed spreadsheets concerning her travel \nexpenses in 2005 and 2006, and suggested that Applicant identify any discrepancies \n(GE 3 at 42). Her supervisor asked Applicant to do her analysis as quickly as possible \nbecause the employer would soon not be able to assist with the reconciliation (GE 3 at \n42). The spreadsheet shows a delinquent amount of $5,973 (Tr. 90; GE 3 at 48 line \none). She said she sent her employer an expense report for $5,000 that was not \nincluded on her spreadsheet (Tr. 132-133); however, she did not describe the content of \nthe expense report. In the last several months, Applicant did not make any payments to \naddress this debt (Tr. 95). I asked her to provide her last expense report so that I could \ncompare it to her employer\u2019s spreadsheet and determine whether or not she received \ncredit for her expenses (Tr. 134). She was unable to locate a copy of her last expense \nreport and on October 29, 2009, she sent an email to her former employer seeking a \ncopy (AE M). She provided an email from another employee whose last expense claim \nwas not resolved for three years (AE P).  \n \nOn November 3, 2009, Applicant\u2019s former employer explained that Applicant \nfailed to submit her expenses for reimbursement within 90 days of the incur date (AE R \nat 3). She failed to complete the filing process early in 2007 to resolve the dispute (AE R \nat 3).6 The analysis indicated she failed to submit several hotel bills from April and May \n2006, with her claims (AE R at 4), and concluded that the related government contract \nis closed, making recovery of the costs from the government problematic (AE R at 6).  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c ($1,410)\u2014SUBSTANTIATED, UNRESOLVED DEBT. This debt \nrelated to Applicant declining to pay her credit card debt because she considered the \nfees and penalties for late payments to be excessive (Tr. 96-99). She opened her \naccount in 2000 (Tr. 102; GE 7 at 6). The creditor charged off $1,104 in October 2001 \n(Tr. 102-103; GE 7 at 6). Eventually the creditor doubled the amount she owed from \nfees, penalties, and interest (Tr. 101-102). She attempted to negotiate a settlement; \nhowever, she stated the creditor was unreasonable (Tr. 99-100).7  \n     \nSOR \u00b6 1.d ($98)\u2014DEBT NOT SUBSTANTIATED. This debt related to a \ntelecommunications account (Tr. 104-105; GE 7 at 11). She denied knowledge of the \naccount (GE 3 at 6). She sent the creditor a letter seeking authentication of the debt (Tr. \n \n6An email dated January 17, 2007, and spreadsheet from Applicant\u2019s employer notes that she \nmay not have filed about $6,500 in hotel expenses and suggests she obtain a receipt from a particular \nhotel and provide it to her employer (AE S, T). There is no evidence that Applicant provided the requested \nreceipt to her employer.   \n \n7This debt apparently does not appear in Applicant\u2019s current credit report because there has not \nbeen any activity on the account for more than seven years, and the information was deleted because it \nwas obsolete. See KCCS agreement (AE K).  \n\n \n6 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n105; letter is similar to the letter at AE C at 1). She did not receive a reply from the \ncreditor in SOR \u00b6 1.d (Tr. 105). She did not pay the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d (Tr. 106).   \n   \nSOR \u00b6 1.e ($3,250)\u2014SUBSTANTIATED, UNRESOLVED DEBT. This debt \nrelated to Applicant breaking her lease on an apartment in 2003 (Tr. 77-78, 81). Her \nfather was ill and she needed to move (Tr. 78). She failed to give the 60-day notice as \nrequired in her contract (Tr. 78). She admitted that she erroneously denied responsibility \nfor this debt in her SOR response (Tr. 79). She has not contacted the creditor (Tr. 80). \nShe believed KCCS would contact the creditor and discuss a settlement for perhaps \nless than $2,000 (Tr. 81). She has not paid anything to this creditor in the last six years \n(Tr. 82). \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f ($329)\u2014DEBT NOT SUBSTANTIATED. This debt was listed in \nApplicant\u2019s September 20, 2007 credit report (Tr. 106; GE 6 at 10). However, Applicant \ndid not recognize the name of the creditor and her 2007 credit report did not include an \naddress for contacting the creditor (Tr. 106; GE 3 at 9).  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.g ($188)\u2014DEBT NOT SUBSTANTIATED. Applicant\u2019s credit report \nindicates this debt is to a bank (Tr. 107). Applicant had an account with the bank (Tr. \n107). She did not contact the bank; however, she expected KCCS to do so (Tr. 108). \nShe did not know if KCCS had contacted the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.g, and she had not \npaid this debt (Tr. 108). \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.h ($1,238)\u2014PAYMENT PLAN. This debt related to Applicant breaking \na lease on an apartment (Tr. 82-83). An August 7, 2009, letter from the creditor states \nshe now owes $2,143 to the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.h for a May 15, 2008, judgment, and \nshe is accruing interest at the rate of 12% per month (AE D). According to her \nagreement with this creditor, the first monthly payment of $300 was due on August 17, \n2009, and $300 was due every 30 days thereafter until the debt was paid (AE D). She \nprovided photocopies of three $300 money orders dated in August, September, and \nOctober 2009, and indicated these three payments made this debt current (Tr. 83-84; \nAE E, I). When she responded to the SOR, she denied this debt because she took \nexception to some of the charges, such as clean-up costs (Tr. 84-87).  \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i to 1.v ($6,458)\u201410 DEBTS NOT SUBSTANTIATED, FOUR \nSUBSTANTIATED, UNRESOLVED DEBTS. These 14 SOR debts all related to medical \nservices Applicant allegedly received. Applicant said she always went to the same \ndoctor (Tr. 67). She believed that if she owed her doctor money he would stop providing \ncare for her (Tr. 67). She contended the 14 accounts should have been paid by her \ninsurance company, or were not her responsibility (Tr. 48-53). She said she submitted \nthe bills or invoices to her insurance company; however, the insurance company did not \npay their portion of the bill (Tr. 53-54). Applicant intended to dispute all 14 medical debts \n(Tr. 69). Applicant provided a February 17, 2009, TransUnion report, which indicated \ntwo medical debts were still valid despite her disputes: SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i ($3,713) and 1.k \n($421) (AE B). After her hearing, Applicant provided her October 30, 2009, Experian \nCredit Report which included the medical debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.n ($207) (AE O at 2) and \n1.q ($110).    \n\n \n7 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \n \nApplicant\u2019s net monthly salary after deductions is $3,526 (Tr. 110-113; GE 3 at \n10; AE J, X). Her monthly expenses are about $2,356,8 leaving about $1,170 to address \nher delinquent debts (Tr. 113-122; GE 3 at 10). After deducting her monthly debt \npayment of $300 to the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.h, her approximate remainder is $870 (Tr. \n124). Applicant rents her current residence (Tr. 32). Her rent is current (Tr. 109-110). In \nJuly 2009, she purchased a 2007 Honda vehicle, and her monthly vehicle payment is \n$450 (Tr. 117). She provides about $150 monthly to her elderly parents (Tr. 119).  Her \nutilities are current (Tr. 123). \n \n \nApplicant believed she would not have delinquent debts in the future because \nshe is no longer traveling due to her employment and has the time to ensure her debts \nare paid or resolved (Tr. 131). Sometimes she did not pay disputed debts because she \nbelieved they were unjust (Tr. 131). She has not incurred any delinquent debt in the last \nthree years (Tr. 151). She has not received credit counseling (Tr. 128). \n \nAfter her hearing, Applicant provided her October 30, 2009, Experian Credit \nReport which included the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b ($5,732) (AE O at 2), and a non-SOR \njudgment filed on May 15, 2008, for $1,753 (AE O at 1).    \n \nCharacter evidence \n \nOn January 25, 2009, Applicant received a superb rating from her supervisor (AE \nG). On a scale of one to five with five being the best rating, she received fives in all \nareas (AE G). She is outstanding in the areas of quality of work, knowledge, \ndependability, ability to improve, organization, problem solving, customer service, \ninterpersonal skills, and technical support skills (AE G). Her supervisor specifically \nnoted her organizational skills and superb ability to maintain pleasant, interpersonal \nrelationships (AE G).  \n   \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). The government\u2019s authority to restrict access to \nclassified information applies similarly in the protection of sensitive, unclassified \ninformation. As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control access \nto information bearing on national security or other sensitive information and to \ndetermine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such \ninformation. See Id. at 527.  \n \nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d  \nRegulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3. \u201cThe standard that must be met for . . . \nassignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the person\u2019s \n \n8Her expenses, excluding debt payments, totaled $1,565 (AE Q at 2). \n\n \n8 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nloyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to \nsensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d Regulation \u00b6 \nC6.1.1.1. Department of Defense contractor personnel are afforded the right to the \nprocedures contained in the Directive before any final unfavorable access determination \nmay be made. See Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.  \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, an \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the \nwhole person. An administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial \nand commonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nsensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard sensitive \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information.   \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant which may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security and trustworthiness suitability. See \nISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance \n[or access to sensitive information].\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, \n2002). The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. \nSee ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance [or \ntrustworthiness] determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, \n484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \n[sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d Section 7 of \nExecutive Order (EO) 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \n\n \n9 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly \nabove, I conclude the relevant trustworthiness concern is under Guideline F (financial \nconsiderations).  \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the trustworthiness concern relating to financial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified [and sensitive] information. An individual who is \nfinancially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to \ngenerate funds. \n  \n  \nAG \u00b6 19 provides two conditions that could raise a trustworthiness concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d; and \u201c(c) \na history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d The Appeal Board has noted, \u201cApplicant\u2019s \ncredit report was sufficient to establish the Government\u2019s prima facie case that \nApplicant had  .  .  .  delinquent [SOR] debts that are of security concern.\u201d ISCR Case \nNo. 03-20327 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006). The SOR listed 22 delinquent debts, \ntotaling $18,872. Applicant\u2019s history of delinquent debt is also documented in her credit \nreports and her oral statement at her hearing. She failed to ensure her creditors were \npaid as agreed. The government established the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) \nand 19(c). Further inquiry about the applicability of mitigating conditions is required.  \n   \n  \nFive mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n\n \n10 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant\u2019s conduct does not warrant full application of AG \u00b6 20(a) because she \ndid not act more aggressively and responsibly to resolve his delinquent debts. Her \ndelinquent debts are \u201ca continuing course of conduct\u201d under the Appeal Board\u2019s \njurisprudence. See ISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008) (citing ISCR \nCase No. 01-03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)). As indicated previously, the SOR listed \n22 delinquent debts, totaling $18,872. Despite some positive developments, Applicant\u2019s \nunresolved, delinquent debts continue to cast doubt on her current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment.  \n \nFour of the fourteen medical SOR debts are established. On February 17, 2009, \nTransUnion reiterated that Applicant still owed the medical debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i ($3,713) \nand 1.k ($421). Applicant provided her October 30, 2009, Experian Credit Report which \nincluded the medical debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.n ($207) and 1.q ($110). There is insufficient \nevidence to establish the other 10 medical debts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i, 1.l, 1.m, 1.o, 1.p, \nand 1.r to 1.v are owed.   \n \nApplicant\u2019s responsibility for four of the eight non-medical SOR debts in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a to \n1.h is established. The debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d ($98), 1.f ($329), and 1.g ($188) were not \nestablished. She denied knowledge of the creditors in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.f, and although \nshe had an account with the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.g, she was unaware of the $188 debt. \nApplicant admitted she did not make any payments on seven of the eight non-medical \nSOR debts. However, Applicant has made sufficient progress paying or resolving one \ndebt. The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.h ($1,238) relates to Applicant breaking a lease on an \napartment. An August 7, 2009, letter from the creditor states she now owes $2,143. \nFrom August to October 2009, she paid $900 to the creditor.  \n \nApplicant receives partial credit under AG \u00b6 20(b) because her financial problems \nwere aggravated when she left employment and was briefly unemployed, and had to \nmove to a different city to secure employment. Her 14 medical debts are another \nuncontrolled aspect of her financial situation.9 She does not receive full mitigating credit \n \n9\u201cEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances \noutside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a \nreasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. \nBd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 \n\n \n11 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                                                                                                                            \nbecause she did not establish that she acted with sufficient initiative and resolve to \naddress her delinquent debts. She did not provide sufficient documentation about her \nfinances to meet her burden and establish mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(b). \n   \nAG \u00b6 20(c) does not fully apply. Applicant did not receive financial counseling. \nAlthough she provided a personal financial statement and used a credit repair company \nto obtain changes to her credit reports, she could have benefited from financial \ncounseling. She did not carefully monitor the credit repair company\u2019s efforts on her \nbehalf. After she learned that she had not successfully disputed debts, she did not take \nthe next step to resolve the delinquent debt, that is, further investigation or negotiation \nof a payment plan. She seemed to have sufficient funds remaining after payment of her \nexpenses and debts to begin payment plans with her SOR creditors. She did not show a \nsufficient track record of reducing and resolving her debts. There are not \u201cclear \nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.\u201d She does not receive \nfull mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(d) because she did not establish good faith10 in the \nresolution of the SOR debts in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a to 1.c, 1.e, 1.i, 1.k, 1.n, and 1.q.   \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e) applies to the debts in 1.j, 1.l, 1.m, 1.o, 1.p, 1.r to 1.v. Applicant hired \na credit repair company to contest the information in her credit reports, and \nsubsequently received some information that 10 medical debts were removed from her \ncredit reports. Although there is minimal documentation supporting Applicant\u2019s dispute \nof any debts, under all the circumstances, I will mitigate these 10 medical debts. \nApplicant had health insurance, and always sought medical care from the same \nprovider. It is probable that her medical care provider failed to provide sufficient \ndocumentation to obtain payments from her insurance company, or her insurance \ncompany failed to adequately explain to her provider what is needed to perfect the \nprovider\u2019s claims. Removal of the medical debts from her credit reports is sufficient to \nshow they were successfully disputed. However, the four medical debts currently listed \non her credit reports (1.i, 1.k, 1.n, and 1.j) are not adequately disputed.  \n \nat 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is \nwhether the Applicant maintained contact with his or her creditors and attempted to negotiate partial \npayments to keep debts current. \n \n10The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant \nmust present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \nsome other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does \nnot define the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the concept of \ngood-faith \u2018requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 Accordingly, an applicant must \ndo more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as \nbankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d \nmitigating condition]. \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \n \n\n \n12 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nSome of Applicant\u2019s non-medical, SOR debts do not appear on the two credit \nreports she provided. However, her credit repair company has disputed some of her \ndebts because they were over seven years old, asserting the debt information was \nobsolete. Under the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence, debts that are beyond the statute of \nlimitations for collections cannot be mitigated solely because they are not collectable.11 \nThere is insufficient evidence to establish she was never responsible for the non-\nmedical debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a to 1.h.       \n \nIn sum, Applicant should have been more diligent and made greater efforts \nsooner to resolve her delinquent debts. Her financial situation was adversely affected by \nher changing employment, needing to move to a different city, and medical debts. Some \ndebts were not paid because she was traveling extensively for her employer. His SOR \nlisted 22 delinquent debts, totaling $18,872. Ten medical debts totaling $2,007 were \nsufficiently disputed and mitigated, and the SOR debt to \u00b6 1.h ($1,238) was in a \npayment plan. Eight SOR debts for $15,012 were not mitigated. I am not confident she \nwill pay these eight delinquent SOR debts because of her insufficient track record of \nfinancial progress on her SOR debts shown over the last three years.     \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance or assignment to a public trust position by \nconsidering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The \nadministrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 \n2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance or assignment to a public trust position must be an overall commonsense \njudgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person \nconcept. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole person \n \n11The statute of limitations clearly and unequivocally ends an Applicant\u2019s legal responsibility to \npay the creditor after the passage of a certain amount of time, as specified in state law. In a series of \ndecisions the Appeal Board has rejected the statute of limitations for debts generated through contracts, \nwhich is the law in all 50 states, as automatically mitigating financial considerations concerns under AG \u00b6 \n20(d). See ISCR Case No. 08-01122 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 9, 2009); ADP Case No. 06-14616 at 3 (App. \nBd. Oct. 18, 2007); ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008); ADP Case No. 07-13041 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Sep. 19, 2008); ISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 29, 2008). See also n. 10, supra.         \n\n \n13 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nanalysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed under that guideline, but \nsome warrant additional comment. \n \n \nAlthough the rationale for reinstating Applicant\u2019s clearance or assignment to a \npublic trust position is insufficient at this time, there are several factors tending to \nsupport approval of her access to sensitive information. Applicant deserves substantial \ncredit for volunteering to support the Department of Defense as an employee of a \ndefense contractor. She provided a superb employee evaluation. There is no evidence \nthat she has a criminal record or has ever violated security rules. There is every \nindication that she is loyal to the United States, the Department of Defense, her \nemployer. She does not abuse alcohol or illegal drugs. She has never been fired from a \njob or left employment under adverse circumstances. Her file does not contain any \nadverse information relating to police involvement. Her changes in employment and \nmedical treatment contributed to her financial woes. She paid $900 towards one of her \nSOR debts, and successfully disputed other adverse financial information. These \nfactors show some responsibility, rehabilitation, and mitigation. \n \nThe whole person factors against continuation of Applicant\u2019s access to sensitive \ninformation are more substantial at this time. Failure to pay or resolve her just debts is \nnot prudent or responsible. Applicant has a lengthy history of financial problems. Some \nof her debts became delinquent more than five years ago. On September 18, 2008, she \nresponded to DOHA interrogatories, and on July 20, 2009, she responded to the SOR. \nShe had ample opportunity to contact her SOR creditors and to make greater progress \nin the resolution of her SOR debts. She did not pay, start payments, adequately dispute, \nor otherwise resolve eight of her SOR debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a to 1.c, 1.e, 1.i, 1.k, 1.n, and \n1.q), which total $15,012. Although she made three, $300 payments to one SOR \ncreditor, her personal financial statement indicates she had sufficient funds after \nexpenses to address more of her delinquent SOR debts.   \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and \ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not \nmitigated trustworthiness concerns pertaining to financial circumstances. I take this \nposition based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 \n(1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d and supporting evidence, \nmy application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative Process, and my \ninterpretation of my responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant has failed to \nmitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I conclude she is \nnot eligible to occupy a public trust position at this time. \n \n\n \n14 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.c: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant  \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.f to 1.h:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.i:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.j:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.k:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.l and 1.m: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.n: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.o and 1.p: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.q: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.r to 1.v: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n  \nConclusion \n   \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant or continue Applicant eligibility for a \npublic trust position.

She admitted using and purchasing marijuana with varying frequency from about November 2006 until November 2007. While employed by a defense contractor and holding a security clearance, Applicant was ordered by her employer to take a drug urinalysis in November 2007 that tested positive. Applicant purchased marijuana about six times from a casual acquaintance she had known for more than 20 years. Her purchases were for her personal use. She paid about $40 each time she purchased marijuana. She smoked the marijuana with a pipe she obtained from the acquaintance. She used it alone and at her home.1 Approximately a week or two after the positive drug test and admitting to her supervisor her marijuana use, Applicant injured her shoulder and was placed on medical leave.2 Applicant had surgery for her injury in January 2008. Applicant was interviewed by an investigator from the Office of Personnel Management on February 20, 2008, and explained she used marijuana because she was under a great deal of stress due to being place in a supervisory position.

Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \nOn November 7, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on November 25, 2008, and elected to \nhave her case decided on the written record. Department Counsel submitted the \nGovernment\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) on January 8, 2009. The FORM was \nmailed to Applicant and it was received on January 27, 2009. Applicant was afforded an \nopportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. \n \n1 \n \n \nMarch 23, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                          \nApplicant did not object to the FORM and did not submit additional material. The case \nwas assigned to me on March 12, 2009.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR. After a thorough and careful \nreview of the pleadings, exhibits, and statements submitted, I make the following \nfindings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is a 46-year-old employee for a defense contractor. She admitted using \nand purchasing marijuana with varying frequency from about November 2006 until \nNovember 2007. While employed by a defense contractor and holding a security \nclearance, Applicant was ordered by her employer to take a drug urinalysis in \nNovember 2007 that tested positive.  \n \n \nApplicant purchased marijuana about six times from a casual acquaintance she \nhad known for more than 20 years. Her purchases were for her personal use. She paid \nabout $40 each time she purchased marijuana. She smoked the marijuana with a pipe \nshe obtained from the acquaintance. She used it alone and at her home.1  \n \n \nApproximately a week or two after the positive drug test and admitting to her \nsupervisor her marijuana use, Applicant injured her shoulder and was placed on \nmedical leave.2 Applicant had surgery for her injury in January 2008.  \n \n \nApplicant was interviewed by an investigator from the Office of Personnel \nManagement on February 20, 2008, and explained she used marijuana because she \nwas under a great deal of stress due to being place in a supervisory position. The use of \nmarijuana made her relax and relieved the stress.3 In her answer to the SOR, she \nexplained she used marijuana because she was \u201cunder a great deal of stress and \npain.\u201d4 Applicant was aware of her employer\u2019s drug policy.  \n \n \nApplicant had anticipated attending a substance abuse program after her \ninterview, but it was delayed until her doctor released her from medical leave. Applicant \nreturned to work on May 19, 2008. She began a drug treatment program in July 2008 \nand completed it in October 2008. She indicated that she was required to take random \nurinalyses and attend narcotics anonymous meetings twice a week and attend classes \nthree times a week.5 She provided a certificate of completion for \u201cPhase I Intensive \n \n1 GE 6. \n \n2 Id. \n \n3 Id. \n \n4 GE 3. \n \n5 GE 6. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                                          \nOutpatient Program Chemical Dependency Treatment\u201d dated October 14, 2008.6 No \nother information was provided about this program. No information was provided as to \nwhether there was a diagnosis or a prognosis regarding Applicant\u2019s drug use. Applicant \nindicated in her answer that she is enrolled in the Employee Assistance Program (EAP) \nthrough her company and she is in compliance with the requirements. No independent \ninformation was provided from the EAP as to what the requirements were and her \ncompliance record. She indicated that from October 24, 2008 to the present she was in \nPhase II of an aftercare treatment program. No information was provided as to what this \ninvolves or the credentials of the program or its counselors. She indicated she will \ncontinue to take random drug tests and will comply with all treatment necessary.7 In \nanswers to interrogatories dated September 15, 2008, Applicant indicated her last use \nof illegal drugs was on November 26, 2007. She also indicated she did not intend to use \nillegal drugs in the future. She also indicated she had learned her lesson and would like \nto put this embarrassment behind her.8 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201dThe applicant is \n \n6 GE 3. \n \n7 Id. \n \n8 GE 6. \n\n \n4 \n \n \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \n \n \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement: \n \nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may \nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.  \n \n \nI have considered all of the evidence in this case and the disqualifying conditions \nunder Drug Involvement AG \u00b6 25 and especially considered the following: \n \n(a) any drug abuse; \n \n(b) testing positive for illegal drug use; \n \n(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, \npurchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia, and \n \n(g) any illegal drug use after being granted a security clearance. \n \n \nApplicant used illegal drugs while holding a security clearance from \napproximately November 2006 to November 2007. She purchased marijuana for her \npersonal use approximately six times. She tested positive for marijuana use while \nemployed by a defense contractor. I find all of the above disqualifying conditions apply. \n\n \n5 \n \n \nI have considered all of the evidence in this case and the mitigating conditions \nunder Drug Involvement AG \u00b6 26 and especially considered the following: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were used; (3) an appropriate \nperiod of abstinence; (4) a signed statement of intent with automatic \nrevocation of clearance for any violation; \n \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness \nduring which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended, \nand \n \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding but not limited to rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s illegal drug use from November 2006 to November 2007 was \nfrequent. She admitted to using marijuana because she felt stress from her job. She has \nnot provided any convincing evidence that these conditions are unlikely to recur. It has \nbeen approximately a year and a half since her last drug use. I do not have any \nevidence other than Applicant\u2019s written response to confirm her abstinence. In addition, \nconsidering Applicant repeated use of illegal drugs while holding a security clearance, I \nfind that her actions cast doubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness and good \njudgment. Therefore, I find (a) does not apply.  \n \n \nThe burden shifted to Applicant to mitigate the security concerns raised by her \nillegal drug use. She did not provide sufficient evidence to substantiate a demonstrated \nintent not to use drugs in the future. There were no records from her drug treatment \nprogram or EAP to substantiate any of her written assertions. Although Applicant \nprovided a certificate of completion for Phase I of a drug treatment program, there was \nminimal information provided as to what Phase I included, what was the extent of the \ntreatment she actually received, whether her drugs test were all negative, whether she \nwas diagnosed as drug dependent or otherwise, or if there was a prognosis for her by a \nduly qualified medical professional or a recommendation for further treatment. No \ninformation was provided as to the accreditation of the program she attended and what, \nif any, the credentials were for counselors she may have seen. No information was \nprovided as to whether Applicant still has an association with the person who supplied \nher marijuana or if she has learned an alternative way to deal with her stress. She did \nnot provide a signed statement of intent not to use illegal drugs with automatic \nrevocation of clearance if she violated it. Applicant provided a certificate of completion \n\n \n6 \n \n \nof some type of drug treatment program; however, without additional independent \ninformation to verify that she is drug free, the certificate is insufficient to mitigate the \nsecurity concerns regarding her drug involvement. I find none of the above mitigating \nconditions apply. \n \nWhole Person\u201d Analysis  \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all \nthe circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security clearance \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant began using marijuana to \nrelieve stress from her job. She continued to use it for approximately a year and while \nholding a secret security clearance. She attended a drug treatment program and \ncompleted Phase I of it, but no specific information was provided about this program or \na prognosis by a duly qualified medical professional. Applicant has the burden of \npersuasion and failed to provide convincing mitigation. For all these reasons, I conclude \nAppellant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from her drug involvement. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nCarol G.
