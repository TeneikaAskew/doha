Minster, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nHOGAN, Erin C., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted a questionnaire for sensitive positions (SF 86) on September \n30, 2008. On March 31, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline \nF, Financial Considerations, to Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn April 21 and 28, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR and requested his case \nbe decided on the written record. Department Counsel prepared a File of Relevant \nMaterial (FORM) on June 26, 2009. The FORM was forwarded to Applicant on June 29, \n2009.  Applicant received the FORM on July 13, 2009. He had 30 days to submit a \nresponse to the FORM. He did not submit a response. On October 8, 2009, the FORM \nwas forwarded to the hearing office. The FORM was assigned to me on that same date. \nOctober 30, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admits all of the allegations in the SOR. \n(Item 4) \n \n \nApplicant is a 36-year-old employee with a Department of Defense contractor \nseeking a security clearance.  He has been employed as a senior engineer since April \n2008. He served on active duty in the United States Air Force from April 1995 to \nSeptember 2006. He separated as an E-5 with an honorable discharge. He is married \nand has three children. He indicates on his SF 86 that he has held a Top Secret \nclearance but does not indicate when he held the clearance and if his security clearance \nis still active. (Item 6)   \n \nApplicant\u2019s security clearance background investigation revealed the following \ndelinquent accounts: a $710 cell phone account placed for collection in May 2008 (SOR \n\u00b6 1.a: Item 8 at 1); a $2,126 credit card account that was charged off in February 2004 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.b: Item 6 at 11; Item 8 at 2; Item 9 at 6); a $2,828 account placed for \ncollection in February 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.c: Item 6 at 11; Item 8 at 3; Item 9 at 10); a \n$11,569 debt owed after an automobile repossession in October 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.d: Item \n6 at 12; Item 8 at 3; Item 9 at 13); a $1,978 credit card account that was placed for \ncollection in September 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.e: Item 6 at 11; Item 8 at 2, 4; Item 9 at 4); and \na $1,750 account placed for collection in October 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.f: Item 6 at 12; Item 8 \nat 2; Item 9 at 13). \n \nIn December 2001, Applicant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. He listed total \nassets of $21,690 and total liabilities of $32,756. His dischargeable debts were \ndischarged by the bankruptcy court on August 13, 2002. (SOR \u00b6 1.g: Item 7; Item 8 at 1; \nItem 9 at 3)  \n \nOther than his admissions, Applicant provided no further evidence in response to \nthe SOR. He did not respond to the FORM. The record does not have information as to \nthe status of Applicant\u2019s current financial situation.  Applicant did not explain the cause \nof his financial problems. He did not provide information about his work performance.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \n\n \n4 \n \n \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. I find Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) &19(a) (an \ninability or unwillingness to satisfy debts); and FC DC &19(c), (a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations); apply to Applicant\u2019s case. The SOR alleges six delinquent \naccounts, an approximate total of $20,961. Applicant\u2019s Chapter 7 bankruptcy that was \nfiled in December 2001 reveals that he has a history of not meeting financial obligations.    \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. There are several Financial Considerations \nMitigating Conditions (FC MC) that have the potential to apply to Applicant\u2019s case. They \nare:  \n \nFC MC \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment);  \n \n \nFC MC & 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances);  \n \n     \nFC MC \u00b620(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol);  \n \nFC MC &20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts);  \n  \nFC MC \u00b620(e) (the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of \nthe past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to \nsubstantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the \nissue).  \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply. Applicant provided no mitigating \nevidence. He had the burden to mitigate the security concern raised under financial \nconsiderations.  He did not meet his burden.  The financial considerations concern is \nfound against Applicant.   \n \n \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has had difficulties \nmeeting his financial obligations since 2001 when he filed for bankruptcy. He received a \nfinancial fresh start when his debts were discharged in August 2002. He continues to \nhave difficulty with his finances and provided no evidence explaining the cause of his \nfinancial problems and what steps he is taking to resolve the situation.  Applicant did not \nprovide enough evidence to support mitigation of the financial considerations concern.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n                                           \n \n \n \n_________________ \nERIN C. HOGAN \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Murphy, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nCURRY, Marc E., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant fell behind on his debt payments in 2006. By early 2007, he had\naccrued approximately $45,000 of delinquent debt. In September 2007, he filed for\nChapter 13 bankruptcy protection. Since then, he has satisfied nearly half of the SOR\ndelinquencies through the plan in steady, monthly payments. Applicant has mitigated\nthe financial considerations security concern. Clearance is granted.\nOn April 1, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline\nF, Financial Considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.\nSeptember 21, 2009\n\n2\nApplicant answered the SOR on April 29, 2009, admitted all of the allegations,\nand requested a hearing. The case was assigned to me on May 27, 2009. On June 11,\n2009, a notice of hearing was issued scheduling the case for July 7, 2009. The hearing\nwas conducted as scheduled. I received seven government exhibits, one Applicant\nexhibit, and Applicant\u2019s testimony. The transcript was received on July 15, 2009.\nPreliminary Ruling\nSOR subparagraph 1.i, alleges as follows: \nYou are indebted to [home mortgage company] on an account that was\nplaced for collection in the approximate amount of $243,000.\nAt the hearing, Department Counsel moved to amend the allegation, as follows:\nYou are indebted to [home mortgage company] on an account in the\napproximate amount of $243,000. As of March 10, 2009, a monthly\nmortgage payment of approximately $2,086 was approximately 30 days\npast due, and had been referred for collection (Tr. 9).\nApplicant did not object to the proposed amendment, and I granted the motion.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 43-year-old single man who lives with his elderly mother. He\nearned a bachelor of science degree in engineering technology in 1989 (Tr. 16). For the\npast nine years, he has worked for a defense contractor as the lead material engineer\nfor an aircraft carrier (Tr. 28). His job duties include designing and overseeing the\ninstallation of high-efficiency lighting fixtures on aircraft carriers (Tr. 17).\nIn the mid-2000s, Applicant decided to finance extensive home renovations.\nAlso, he spent between ten and twelve thousand dollars on new furniture, (Tr. 52). In\n2006, he purchased several more \u201cbig-ticket\u201d items including a car, a flat screen\ntelevision, and some jewelry (Tr. 37, 61).\nApplicant gradually became financially overextended. He then began using\npayday loans to satisfy his debts (Tr. 42). Each time his finances \u201ccame up short,\u201d he\nobtained another payday loan (Id.). Also, he refinanced his home multiple times,\ncashing out the equity to supplement his income (Tr. 62). Each time he refinanced, the\nmortgage\u2019s interest rate increased (Tr. 59). By 2009, the interest rate had increased to\n10.3 per cent (Tr. 45, 67).\nBy early 2007, Applicant had accrued approximately $45,000 of delinquent debt,\nas listed in the SOR (see generally, Answer). In May 2007, Applicant filed for Chapter\n13 bankruptcy protection (Answer at 1). The court dismissed the case in July 2007 after\nApplicant failed to make a payment on time (Exhibit 3 at 7).\n\n3\nApplicant re-filed the Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition in September 2007 (Id. at\n24; Tr. 57). The bankruptcy petition included all of the SOR debts. Under the new\nChapter 13 plan, Applicant was to pay approximately $70,000, including the SOR debts,\nother debts not listed in the SOR, and miscellaneous fees (Id. at 37-45). Between\nSeptember 2007 and April 2008, Applicant paid $9,500 into the plan through regular,\nmonthly payments (Id. at 46). \nOn March 26, 2008, Applicant filed a motion to modify the bankruptcy petition to\nenable him to pay automatically through monthly wage garnishments (Id. at 28). The\ncourt granted the motion. Since then, he has paid $1,692 per month through wage\ngarnishments under the plan, and any income tax refunds have been applied to the plan\n(Id. at 46; Exhibit A). Also, he has made approximately $3,000 of periodic payments in\naddition to the wage garnishment payments (Id.). By the hearing date, he had paid,\napproximately $31,500 into the Chapter 13 bankruptcy plan. \nAs part of the bankruptcy process, the court required Applicant to attend a\nfinancial counseling session in mid-2007 (Tr. 43, 55). He learned how to organize a\nbudget, and to develop strategies to control his spending (Tr. 43). \nAt some point during the past two years, Applicant missed a property tax\npayment (Tr. 63-64). At or about that time, the state where Applicant resides, increased\nthe property tax rate (Tr. 63). Before this time, Applicant had been paying his property\ntaxes separately from his mortgage. After Applicant missed the property tax payment,\nthe mortgagor increased the escrow portion of Applicant\u2019s monthly mortgage payments\nto include property taxes (Id.; Exhibit 3 at 4). Applicant was unable to afford the\nincreased mortgage payment. By March 2009, his mortgage payments became\ndelinquent (Exhibit 3 at 15).\nIn May 2009, Applicant retained an attorney to negotiate a loan modification (Tr.\n47). Through his attorney, Applicant is working to consolidate the delinquent amount\ninto the amount due under the modified loan (Tr. 65). His attorney has notified the\nmortgage company that Applicant will not be making any additional mortgage payments\nuntil the loan modification is completed (Tr. 63, 67).\nApplicant earns $62,000 annually (Tr. 44). He has no credit cards (Tr. 50). To\nsupplement his income, Applicant obtained a part-time job in 2007 (Tr. 29; 67). Also, he\nearns additional income as a blood plasma donor (Tr. 67). He has altered his lifestyle,\nspending less on entertainment. He has approximately $200 of after-expense monthly\nincome (Tr. 50). \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\n\n4\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a\nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d\nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nUnder this guideline, \u201cfailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information\u201d (AG\n\u00b6 18). Applicant\u2019s history of financial problems triggers the application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a),\n\u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial\nobligations.\u201d\nApplicant readily acknowledges that irresponsible spending caused his financial\ndelinquencies. Further, he is still satisfying his delinquencies through the Chapter 13\nbankruptcy process. Neither AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so\ninfrequent, or occurred under such circumstance that it is unlikely to recur and does not\ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d nor\n20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the\nperson\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical\nemergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), and the individual acted responsibly\nunder the circumstances,\u201d apply.\nApplicant has been satisfying his delinquencies with substantial monthly\npayments through the bankruptcy process for two years. He has paid approximately\n$31,500 into the plan, nearly half the amount due. In the past 18 months, he has made\n\n5\napproximately $3,000 of payments in excess of the payments required under the\ngarnishment. He has internalized the lessons learned from the court\u2019s mandatory\nfinancial counseling session, budgeting his money, altering his lifestyle, and obtaining a\npart-time job to supplement his income. \nApplicant\u2019s accrual of a mortgage delinquency while the Chapter 13 bankruptcy\npayment plan is still ongoing raises a concern as to whether he has truly rehabilitated\nhis finances. This concern is outweighed by the amount of time Applicant has been\nsatisfying his debts through the Chapter 13 plan, the amount of debt paid through the\nplan, the efforts Applicant has taken to supplement his income, and the steps Applicant\nhas taken to resolve the mortgage delinquency. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c), \u201cthe person has received\nor is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the\nproblem is being resolved or is under control,\u201d and 20(d), \u201cthe individual initiated a good-\nfaith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts,\u201d apply.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nApplicant accrued substantial debt purchasing luxury items such as flat-screen\ntelevisions and furniture. As his debt became unmanageable, he compounded the\nproblem by obtaining payday loans. The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct\nis significant.\nThe nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct is outweighed by the\npresence of rehabilitation, however. Applicant filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection\nand has paid $31,500 into the bankruptcy plan through consistent monthly payments for\ntwo years. Applicant\u2019s current, delinquent mortgage status does not alter this\nconclusion. He has confronted his debts aggressively through the Chapter 13 process,\npaying $3,000 more than the plan\u2019s scheduled payments. Moreover, the mortgage\ndelinquency was caused in part by an increase in the escrow portion of the mortgage\ngenerated by a state property tax increase. Also, the mortgage delinquency has\nremained outstanding at Applicant\u2019s attorney\u2019s instruction while loan modification\n\n6\nnegotiations are pending. Once the modification is finalized, Applicant\u2019s delinquency will\nbe consolidated into the amount due under the modified loan. \nApplicant has made permanent behavioral changes, cutting back on\nentertainment expenses and foregoing credit cards. He has obtained a part-time job to\nsupplement his income. Upon considering the relevant disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions in light of the whole person concept, I conclude the likelihood of continuation\nor recurrence of Applicant\u2019s financial problems is minimal. Applicant has mitigated the\nfinancial considerations security concern.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFor APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.o:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

On July 23, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under\nGuideline F. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nOn August 26, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing. I\nreceived the case on September 18, 2009. On October 1, 2009, a Notice of Hearing\nwas issued scheduling the hearing for October 30, 2009. The hearing was convened as\nscheduled. Department Counsel submitted five exhibits (GE) 1-5, without objection.\nApplicant introduced four exhibits (AE) A-D, without objection. The documents were\nadmitted into the record. Applicant testified on his own behalf. I left the record open until\nDecember 18, 2009\n\n2\nNovember 6, 2009, so that Applicant could submit additional information. He submitted\nan additional packet which was marked as AE E, without objection. The transcript (Tr.)\nwas received on November 9, 2009. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings,\nexhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant denied the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a\nthrough 1.p of the SOR with explanation. \nApplicant is a 57-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He served in the\nUnited States Air Force from 1970 until 1991, when he retired (AE E). Since April 2008,\nApplicant has been employed as a Facility Manager with his current employer (Tr.18).\nHe has held a top secret clearance since 1988 (Tr. 19). Applicant has more than 30\nyears of employment in his field. He is married and has four stepchildren (GE 1). \nIn 2005, Hurricane Katrina devastated the area where Applicant worked as a\nproject manager. For two years, Applicant stayed with his 68 employees who lost\nalmost everything. As a result of the devastation, his wife, who is older and has some\nhealth issues, left the area and moved to another state. During those two years (until\nJune 2007) he provided for himself and his wife living in another state (Tr. 21). This\ncreated financial difficulties above and beyond the havoc that the hurricane created. His\nwife was retired and living on a fixed income. Applicant was supporting her and paying\nhousehold expenses for two residences.\nApplicant used a credit card to help pay for expenses. He was not able to pay his\nbills in a timely manner. Prior to July 2005, Applicant had no difficulties with his financial\nsituation. He had no debt and was earning a good salary (Tr. 23). His credit was good.\nApplicant\u2019s mother and father died during this very difficult time. His mother died\nright before Katrina. His father died in 2007. He explained that he was taught how to be\nresponsible and was not happy with the situation that occurred with his finances. \nApplicant was candid explaining the horror that occurred after the hurricane. He\ntried to help his employees, three of whom had nowhere to live. The interruption of daily\nlife was incredible. He expended most of his energy trying to stabilize his employees\nand to help the work project. He arranged for donations from his family around the\ncountry for some employees in an amount of $2,000 (Tr. 44). He attempted to carry on\na daily existence despite the living nightmare. He admitted that some mail that he\nreceived was thrown away. He had a difficult time paying attention to bills in the mail\nwhen he did receive them (Tr. 20). He does not believe this excuses him, but he was\nconcerned about the lives of the people around him (Tr. 20). The priority was to survive.\nWhen his wife left, he was distraught and even threw away mail. His accounts became\ndelinquent.\n\n3\nIn 2007, Applicant\u2019s wife sold the house she was living in. When Applicant moved\nto be with her, they rented an apartment. Applicant found employment when he\nrelocated to be with his wife, but took a $30,000 pay cut. It was not until 2008, when he\nobtained his current employment, that he recovered the reduction in wages. In 2008,\nApplicant\u2019s wife required surgery.\nThe SOR alleges delinquent debts totaling approximately $79,000 (GE 5).\nApplicant contacted Consumer Credit Counseling in April 2008, immediately after he\nwas hired by his current employer. He attended financial counseling and created a\nbudget. He had already contacted the counseling organization earlier but did not have\nthe money to implement the payment plan (Tr. 26). He chose this organization because\nthey do not require an exorbitant up-front fee (Tr. 27). He met with them and arranged a\npayment plan to cover his debts. In June 2008, the first funds were automatically\ntransferred from his checking account (AE C). This agency does not negotiate away\ninterest and late fees, thus the amount of money owed does not reflect the original\namount of debt that Applicant owed to creditors. Applicant has paid two other debts that\nare not listed on the SOR. The debts were for a line of credit from a credit union. He\npaid approximately $4,000 (Tr. 28). He also paid $4,500 for federal tax due from tax\nyear 2005.  \nThe current status of Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts is as follows: Applicant pays\n$1,610 a month through the Consumer Credit Counseling payment plan for accounts\nlisted in the SOR (AE C). Applicant pays a monthly amount of $315 for the account\nlisted in SOR \u00b6 1.c. The balance is approximately $11,000 down $4,000. The accounts\nlisted in SOR \u00b6 1.e, 1.f, 1.m and 1.n are paid in full. Three additional accounts will be\npaid in full by the end of December 2009. Applicant will apply the extra money to other\naccounts (Tr. 38). Applicant has paid more than half the original delinquent amount\nalleged in the SOR. He estimates that he owes $36,000 in delinquent debt.\nApplicant\u2019s net monthly income is approximately $5,943, which includes his\nmilitary retirement income (GE 2). He is current with his monthly expenses of $3,425\n(AE D). He has no credit cards (Tr. 31). Applicant has a retirement account and saves\nan amount of money each month. He does not have a car loan.\nApplicant received many decorations and awards during his 21 year career in the\nmilitary. His awards and medals include an Air Force Commendation with an Oak Leaf\nCluster, Air Force Achievement Medals, Air Force Good Conduct Medal with four Oak\nLeaf Clusters and an Air Force Longevity Service Medal with four Oak Leaf Clusters. He\nearned an Air Force Overseas Service Short Tour Ribbon with one Oak Leaf Cluster.\nHe retired as a Master Sergeant in 1991.\nApplicant is described by his supervisor as an outstanding and dedicated\nemployee (AE E). In 2008, he received an award and Certificate of Appreciation for\noutstanding job performance (AE E).\n\n4\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2,\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).\n  \n\n5\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated delinquent debts on many accounts for\nseveral years. He owed approximately $79,000. He did not make any payments in 2005\nor 2006. His credit reports confirm the debts. The evidence is sufficient to raise these\ndisqualifying conditions.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the concern may be\nmitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant had no\ndifficulty with his finances until Hurricane Katrina devastated the state in summer 2005.\nHe attempted to help his employees through this horrific time. He did not make\npayments on his bills. He stayed in the state to help with the project. His wife left the\nstate and he had additional expenses. His judgment may have been clouded with the\nterrible waste and devastation that occurred. This was not typical behavior for this\ncareer military man. He has addressed the delinquent debts and did not shirk his\nresponsibility when he was able to concentrate on life in 2007. His lower pay caused\nsome delay in his payment plan, but he has been consistent with his payments since\nApril 2008. His judgment and reliability are not at issue at this time. This mitigating\ncondition applies. \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ This mitigating condition\napplies in part based on the reasoning above. In addition, his wife was ill and this\ncaused an additional hardship. \n\n6\nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the\nevidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant received financial counseling, and created a budget.\nHe began his repayment plan and has an organized plan to resolve the remaining\ndebts. He has paid more than half of the original debt. His efforts are sufficient to carry\nhis burden in this case. I conclude these mitigating conditions apply.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant served in the military for\n21 years and received many awards and decorations. He has worked for defense\ncontractors for many years. He has held a top secret security clearance since 1988\nwithout any problem. He is rated as outstanding by his employer. He served his\nemployer during Katrina and remained at the site after the hurricane to help. He had\npersonal hardship at the time as well. He was very distressed at the overall situation\nand tried to handle things as best as he could given the horrible situation.\nApplicant obtained counseling and started to repay his creditors prior to the SOR.\nHe has consistently paid a monthly amount of $1,610 since obtaining his current\nposition. Several account are already paid in full. He is saving money. He is responsible\nand has the ability to pay his debts.  \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\n\n7\nconclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising under the financial\nconsiderations security guideline. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.p.\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                              \n_________________\nNOREEN A. LYNCH\nAdministrative Judge\n",

In his\ninterrogatory answers submitted to the Government on August 7, 2009, Applicant\nagreed with the investigator\u2019s summary of his October 2010 interview, and\nacknowledged the interview summary could be used in a security clearance hearing to\ndetermine his security suitability. On January 21, 2011, DOHA issued a Statement of\nReasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under alcohol consumption (Guideline G).\nThe action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nOctober 13, 2011\n\n GE 5.\n1\n SOR 1.d alleges the charge occurred while Applicant was in the Air Force. Applicant indicated he was\n2\ndischarged from the Air Force in December 1998. (SCA at 7) \n2\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG),\nimplemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006. \nApplicant furnished his answer to the SOR on February 24, 2011. DOHA issued\na notice of hearing on July 1, 2011, for a hearing on July 19, 2011. The hearing was\nheld as scheduled. At the hearing, eight exhibits (GE I through 8) were admitted in\nevidence without objection to support the government's case. Applicant and a witness\ntestified. Applicant\u2019s five exhibits were admitted into evidence without objection. DOHA\nreceived the transcript on August 3, 2011. The record closed on August 3, 2011. \nFindings of Fact\nThe SOR, dated January 21, 2011, consists of 13 factual allegations under the\nalcohol consumption guideline (Guideline G). Applicant admitted all allegations. \nApplicant is 36 years old and single. He attended three semesters of college. He\nserved in the United States Air Force from December 1994 to December 1998, and\nUnited States Coast Guard from March 2001 to August 2004. He has been employed by\nhis current employer since January 2007. \nHistory of Alcohol Consumption \nApplicant began drinking alcohol when he was 11 years old. He drank to\nintoxication for the first time when he was 16 years old. He continued to regularly\nconsume alcohol between the age of 16 and 21. When he joined the Air Force in 1994,\nhis drinking increased to 12 cans of beer and five shots of whiskey about three times a\nweek. \nWhile in the Air Force, Applicant admitted public intoxication charges in 1995 and\n1999. In July 1996, he received non-judicial punishment (NJC) under Article 111 of the\nUniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) for physically controlling a vehicle with a blood\nalcohol content of .15 grams per 210 liters.  His punishment was a reduction in grade,\n1\n21 days extra duty, and forfeiture of $490 pay for two months. After his discharge from\nthe Air Force, Applicant was charged with public intoxication in 1999.  \n2\nIn March 2001, Applicant joined the United States Coast Guard because he\nmissed the military. In 2002, he was screened by a medical clinic for an alcohol-related\nincident at work. In August 2003, Applicant was charged with public intoxication. \n\n GE 4 at 5. (page numbers are handwritten and located in the lower right corner of the page)\n3\n Id. at 7. \n4\n Id. at 4-5.\n5\n GE 3. at 5.\n6\n Tr. 38-42.\n7\n3\nIn March 2004, Applicant was charged with pubic intoxication. He and a friend\nhad gotten \u201cdrunk\u201d at a bar. Applicant consumed approximately six cans of beer and\nthree single shots of whiskey. He and his friend decided to walk back to the installation.\nOn the way, a group of individuals began bothering them. Before the altercation\nescalated, local police arrived on the scene and resolved the situation. When Applicant\nindicated he was in the Coast Guard, the police waited for Applicant\u2019s command to take\nhim back to the Coast Guard installation. The police did not charge him.\nApplicant received non-judicial punishment for public intoxication under the\nUCMJ for the March 2004 incident. The punishment consisted of forfeiture of one-half\nmonth\u2019s pay, a $500 fine, and an order to complete an alcohol screening and\ncounseling program. Applicant was willing to attend treatment, but did not want to\nabstain from alcohol.  \n3\nFrom March to May 2004, Applicant received treatment at the Substance Abuse\nRehabilitation Program (SARP). Medical health professionals reviewed Applicant\u2019s\nreasons for treatment, his chemical history, and his emotional and behavioral history.\nBased on his screening questionnaire, his medical and service record, his command\ninformation package, and the clinical interview, it was decided by qualified medical\nprofessionals (psychologist, certified substance abuse counselor of recognized alcohol\ntreatment program) that Applicant met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental\ndisorders (DSM IV) criteria for alcohol dependence.4\nApplicant was advised to attend a 30-day outpatient program that consisted of\ngroup and individual counseling eight hours a day and Alcoholics Anonymous (AA)\nmeetings at night.  Applicant did not believe that he should have to participate in this\n5\nprogram because he was never charged with a crime in civilian court system. After\napproximately two weeks into the program, Applicant missed a group meeting in the\nmorning. He lied to the counselor by stating he was at the group meeting, but could not\nidentify the topic that was discussed that day. The counselor reviewed Applicant\u2019s file\nand stated his attitude was \u201cdisruptive towards his successful completion of the\nprogram.\u201d  Applicant\u2019s command informed him that his removal from the rehabilitation\n6\nprogram would probably limit Applicant\u2019s chances for promotion. Rather than remaining\nin the Coast Guard, Applicant chose his command\u2019s second option to accept an\nhonorable discharge.  Applicant\u2019s Department of Defense (DD) Form 214 indicates that\n7\nin August 2004, he received an honorable discharge based on alcohol rehabilitation\nfailure. \n\n No additional information was provided regarding the finding of guilt in absentia. \n8\n Id. at 6\n9\n GE 8 at 2. The page number appear in the upper right hand corner of the page.\n10\n On October 8, 2008 (day of interview with OPM), Applicant was still on probation. (GE 3 at 7) \n11\n GE 3 at 7.\n12\n4\nIn December 2004, Applicant was employed as a bartender. He became\nintoxicated at a holiday party located on one of the floors of a hotel. He took off part of\nhis tuxedo and went to the hotel lobby. A police officer told Applicant to return to his\nhotel room, but Applicant did not comply and continued talking to hotel guests. When\nasked his name by the arresting officer, Applicant responded \u201cElvis,\u201d the name used by\nhis friends. Applicant surmised the officer considered Applicant\u2019s reply disrespectful,\nand arrested him for appearing in public while intoxicated. He was found guilty in\nabsentia. (GE 6)  He was fined $380. \n8\nIn January 2005, Applicant attended a party at a bar. During the evening of the\nparty, Applicant decided to walk home. A police officer arrested him for being drunk in\npublic. Applicant was found guilty and fined $250 and court costs. \nIn August 2008, Applicant was arrested for disorderly conduct on the premises of\na business (bar). Applicant and his girlfriend had been drinking at several bars all day.\nAt some time during the evening, he and his girlfriend separated and he continued to go\nfrom bar to bar. He encountered some friends, and began horse playing with one of\nthem. The bar security thought they were really fighting each other. Applicant recalled\nbeing very intoxicated at the time.  The arrest report reflects that he was \u201cextremely\n9\nintoxicated and staggered to walk.\u201d  Applicant pled no contest to disorderly conduct. He\n10\nwas fined $301, and placed on six months probation. He was ordered to attend an\nalcohol awareness class.  \n11\nWhen Applicant was interviewed by OPM in October 2008, he stated he was not\ndrinking during the week anymore. On the weekends, he was drinking up to 12 beers\nand three shots of whiskey about four times a month. He did not believe his drinking\ncaused financial problems. He admitted a pattern of alcohol abuse, particularly between\n2004 and 2006 where worked in the bar environment. \nApplicant also told the OPM investigator that since he began working for his\ncurrent employer in 2006, Applicant has been taking his job more seriously. He did not\nbelieve he had a problem with alcohol and had taken no steps to reduce his alcohol\nintake. Even though he considered he was a victim of circumstance in the cited alcohol-\nrelated incidents, he planned to avoid future incidents that could potentially involve law\nenforcement. Applicant did not intend to seek counseling.12\n\n Tr. 33.\n13\n Tr. 27.\n14\n Tr. 29.\n15\n AE 14. \n16\n Id.\n17\n T. 31.\n18\n5\nAt the personal appearance, Applicant testified that he agreed with the alcohol\ndependence diagnosis that he received in April 2004, but does not believe the diagnosis\nis valid today.13\nApplicant still continues to consume alcohol, but in 2009, he became a social\ndrinker and drinks only with his colleagues.  He testified that he drinks only wine and a\n14\nbeer on occasion. He indicated that he stopped drinking liquor because it always got\nhim into trouble.15\nAt Applicant\u2019s request, his licensed clinical health counselor (LCHC) provided a\nstatement about treatment furnished to Applicant in 2009. The LMHC explained that\nApplicant provided him with the historical events surrounding Applicant\u2019s alcohol use.\nThe absence of more recent alcohol-related incidents after the termination of his\ntreatment in 2009, in the LMHC\u2019s opinion, confirmed Applicant\u2019s \u201ccommitment in\nexamining and effectively addressing the issues surrounding his alcohol use .... \u201d  The\n16\nLMHC also believed the lack of incidents reinforced his opinion that Applicant posed no\nrisk by having a security clearance.17\nIn his statement, Applicant\u2019s LMHC concluded his treatment of Applicant in 2009,\nand not in June 2010 as Applicant testified.  The LMHC supplied no reasons, except\n18\nthe clinical interview, for his opinions, specifically given Applicant\u2019s resumption of\nalcohol consumption following his diagnosis as alcohol dependent and treatment. \nCharacter Evidence\nApplicant supplied several certificates of training. On June 17. 2011, he received\na Security Reaction Force Certificate. (AE A) On February 23, 2007, Applicant received\na certificate signifying that he had completed a firearm instruction school. (AE B)\nApplicant\u2019s supervisor on site commended Applicant for being a real professional as an\ninstructor in antiterrorism. (AE C) The courses Applicant has either taught or is going to\nteach in July 2011, are listed in AE D.   \nMr. A testified that Applicant supervised him for about a year on a project they\nboth were assigned overseas. They shared an apartment during the year-long\nassignment. In Mr. A\u2019s view, Applicant is a very productive worker and worthy of a\n\n Tr. 54-55.\n19\n6\nposition of trust with the Government. Mr. A recalled Applicant drinking alcohol primarily\nat dinner. Since returning from their overseas assignment, Mr. A has observed\nApplicant drink wine and scotch.  \n19\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant's suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the AG. Each guideline lists potentially disqualifying\nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be used in evaluating an\napplicant's eligibility for access to classified information.\nThe administrative judge's ultimate goal is to reach a fair and impartial decision\nthat is based on commonsense. The decision should also include a careful, thorough\nevaluation of a significant period of a person\u2019s life that should be  weighed and balanced\nwith a number of variables known as the \"whole-person concept\" that brings together all\navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and\nunfavorable. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the\napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such\ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of the potential,\nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14., the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.l5., the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \"witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\" The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion for obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\nAnalysis\nAlcohol Consumption \nAG \u00b6 21 sets forth the security concern under alcohol consumption: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable\njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.\nAG \u00b6 22 has five conditions that may be disqualifying:\nAG \u00b6 22(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work regardless of\nwhether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol\ndependent.\n\n7\nAG \u00b6 22(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of\nimpaired judgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as\nan alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent;\nAG \u00b6 22(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional of alcohol\nabuse or alcohol dependence; \nAG \u00b6 22(e) evaluation of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence by a\nlicensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized\nalcohol treatment program; and\nAG \u00b6 22(f) relapse after diagnosis of alcohol abuse or dependence and\ncompletion of an alcohol rehabilitation program. \nThe Government has established a case of excessive alcohol consumption within\nthe scope of Guideline G. Applicant has committed at least eight alcohol-related\noffenses between 1995 and August 2008. Before most of the incidents, he was binge\ndrinking. He was diagnosed as alcohol dependent in April 2004 and was terminated\nfrom treatment in May 2004. He has continued to consume alcohol. AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a), 22(c),\n22(d), 22(e), and 22(f) apply. \nThere are three conditions that potentially mitigate Appellant\u2019s alcohol\nconsumption:\nAG \u00b6 23(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent,\nor it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to\nrecur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and\nAG \u00b6 23(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of\nalcohol abuse, provides evidence actions taken to overcome this problem,\nand has established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or\nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser).\nAG \u00b6 23(d) the individual has successfully completed an inpatient or\noutpatient treatment counseling or rehabilitation along with any required\nafter care, has demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified\nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment\nrecommendations, such as participation in meetings of AA or a similar\norganization and has received a favorable diagnosis by a duly qualified\nmedical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff\nmember of a recognized treatment program.\nAG \u00b6 23(a) does not apply. The passage of approximately three years since\nApplicant\u2019s last alcohol-related incident is not mitigating because of the pattern of\nalcohol-related conduct since 1996, Applicant\u2019s diagnosis of alcohol dependence in April\n\n8\n2004, and his continuing consumption of alcohol. In view of Applicant\u2019s alcohol history,\ndoubts remain about Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. \nAG \u00b6 23(b) does not apply. Although Applicant agreed with the alcohol\ndependence diagnosis he received in April 2004, his subsequent rejection of that\ndiagnosis is not persuasive. He has taken no positive steps to adjust his lifestyle to\ncreate an environment that facilitates sobriety. \nThe diagnosis of alcohol dependence rendered against Applicant in April 2004,\nhis failure to complete the outpatient treatment program in May 2004, and produce a\nclear and established pattern of abstinence since that time, removes AG \u00b6 23(d) from\nconsideration. The opinion by Applicant\u2019s LMHC has little probative value because the\ntreatment was for a relationship problem and not for alcohol dependency. Also, the\nopinion is based on nothing more than clinical interviews. Applicant\u2019s claim of reduced\ndrinking does not satisfactorily alleviate the potential for adverse alcohol-related conduct\nin the future. Applicant has the burden of demonstrating that the alcohol dependence\ndiagnosis is no longer valid, and he has not satisfied his burden. The alcohol\nconsumption guideline is resolved against Applicant.\nWhole-Person Concept \nI have examined the evidence under the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in\nmy ultimate finding against Applicant under the alcohol consumption guideline. I have\nalso weighed the circumstances within the context of nine variables known as the\nwhole-person concept. In evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the\nadministrative judge should consider the following factors:\nAG \u00b6 2(a) (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich the participation was voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and, (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThere is mitigating evidence that weighs in Applicant\u2019s favor. He is 36 years old\nand has served in the U.S. Air Force for four years and U.S. Coast Guard for more than\nthree years, receiving and honorable discharge August 2004. He has compiled a\nfavorable performance record since he began working for his current employer in\nJanuary 2007. He was straightforward in discussing his alcohol consumption and the\nalcohol-related incidents.\nApplicant\u2019s security clearance application is denied because he failed to\ndemonstrate that the diagnosis of alcohol dependence is no longer correct and that his\ncurrent alcohol consumption poses no security concerns. In addition, he does not\n\n9\nunderstand the full nature and scope of his excessive alcohol consumption. He was\ninvolved in at least eight alcohol-related incidents between 1996 and August 2008. In\nApril 2004, he was diagnosed alcohol dependent. Even though Applicant was ordered to\ncomplete treatment, he was terminated after about two weeks into treatment because\nhe missed a meeting and initially lied about his absence so he would not be removed.\nThere is no evidence in the record that suggests voluntary abstinence by Applicant at\nany time during his drinking history. \nAfter evaluating the evidence with the disqualifying and mitigating conditions\nunder the alcohol consumption guideline, and in the contest of the whole-person model,\nApplicant has not mitigated Guideline G. See AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a)(1) through 2(a)(9). \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1 (Guideline G):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a through 1.m: \nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n                      \nPaul J. Mason\nAdministrative Judge\n",

He seeks a security clearance, which \nis a requirement for his continued employment. (GE 1, Tr. 17.)  \n \nApplicant graduated from high school in June 1966. He attended community \ncollege from January 1985 to December 1986, and was awarded an Associate in \nScience degree. He subsequently was awarded a Bachelor of Science degree, date \nuncertain.

His two youngest sons live at home, and his oldest son \nis serving in the U.S. Marine Corps. (GE 1, 25-27.)  \n \n \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nApplicant\u2019s background investigation addressed his financial situation and \nincluded the review of his October 2008 e-QIP, his April and May 2009 responses to \nDOHA Interrogatories; as well as his November 2008, February 2009, June 2009, \nNovember 2009, and January 2010 credit reports. Applicant\u2019s SOR identified eight \nseparate debts totaling $39,218. (GE 1 \u2013 8, Tr. 12.) (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. \u2013 1.h.) \n \nApplicant has settled, paid, or otherwise resolved the eight debts alleged. A \nbrief summary of each debt follows. The debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. and 1.b. are \npast-due credit card accounts (same credit card company) in the amounts of $17,577 \nand $3,657, respectively.

(AE A, Tr. 40-44.)  \n \nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c. is a past-due credit card account in the amount \nof $893. Applicant settled this account for $475, which he paid in July 2009. (AE B, Tr. \n44-46.)  \n \nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d. is a past-due credit card account in the amount \nof $1,661. Applicant had been making monthly payments on this account for \napproximately one year before the hearing. Post-hearing, he settled the remaining \nbalance owed on this account for $601, which he paid in February 2010. (AE I, Tr. 46-\n48.)  \n \nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e. is a past-due credit card account in the amount \nof $7,773. Applicant settled this account with the creditor for approximately $3,000. In \nDecember, the creditor issued the Applicant a Form 1099C, Cancellation of Debt, for \n$4,602.36. Applicant reported this amount when he filed his income tax return. (AE C, \nTr. 49-51.) \n \nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f. is for a past-due credit card in the amount of \n$1,219. Applicant settled this account for $605.93, which he paid in May 2009. (AE D, \nTr. 53-54.)  \n \nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g. is for a past-due medical bill in the amount of \n$170, which Applicant paid in full in September 2009. (AE E, Tr. 54-55.) \n \nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h. is for a past-due credit card in the amount of \n$6,268. Applicant has been making monthly payments by allotment in the amount of \n$203.81 since mid-2009. The account is current. (AE F, Tr. 55-59.) \n \nPost-hearing, Applicant submitted documentation that he paid off two past-due \nmedical bills that were not alleged in the SOR. (AE G, AE H, Tr. 59-60.) \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant attributes his financial problems to the fact that his small business \nfailed in 2008 as a result of the recent economic downturn. From 1996 to 2008, \nApplicant owned an ice cream distributorship and a mobile vending business in the \noff-road areas in his county of residence. (GE 2, Tr. 30-32.) When the economy failed, \nthe off-road vehicle community significantly reduced its off-road vehicle use. With little \nor no income, Applicant resorted to using his credit cards to make ends meet. He \nreached a point where his business was doing so poorly and he was so deep in debt \nthat he was forced to close his business in the latter part of 2008. He is actively \nlooking for buyers to purchase his business assets. (GE 3, Tr. 33-37.) Applicant \nestimates that his business assets are worth $50,000 to $60,000; however, \u201c[he \nwould] be willing to take [$20,000] for [them] if [he] could get that.\u201d (Tr. 64.) \n \nIn conclusion, Applicant has paid, settled, made good-faith efforts to repay \noverdue creditors, or resolved all debts alleged. Applicant remains current on the rest \nof his monthly bills. His budget further demonstrates that he maintains a modest \nlifestyle and is living within his means.   \n \nCharacter Evidence \n \nAfter Applicant retired from the Navy, he became very active and involved in his \ncommunity. He served as a city councilman for seven years, and during those seven \nyears served as mayor for two terms. He served on his city planning commission, \nserved as a board member of his state league of cities for a one-year term, and is \ncurrently the president of the board of directors of his county school district, serving a \nsecond four-year term. (GE 2, Tr. 62-64.) \n \nApplicant called four character witnesses to testify on his behalf, a grocery \nstore and ice plant owner, his contract site manager, his immediate supervisor, and a \nco-worker. The first witness spoke of Applicant\u2019s integrity and honesty and \nemphasized that Applicant was a \u201cman of his word.\u201d He verified the business downturn \nthat Applicant experienced. The remaining three work-related witnesses described \nApplicant as \u201ca real professional,\u201d \u201chonest,\u201d \u201cdependable,\u201d \u201cvery good character,\u201d \u201cvery \nsmart,\u201d and an asset to their company. All the witnesses recommended that Applicant \nbe granted a security clearance. (Tr. 66-94.) \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to \nbrief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \n\n \n5 \n \n \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration \nof the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly \nabove, I conclude that a relevant security concern exists under Guideline F (financial \nconsiderations). AG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial \nproblems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \n\n \n6 \n \n \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n  \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides two financial considerations disqualifying conditions that \ncould raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s history of delinquent debt is established by his admissions and the \nevidence presented. As indicated in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. to 1.h., he had eight delinquent \ndebts totaling $39,218 that were in various states of delinquency since at least 2008. \nThe Government established the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c).   \n \n  \nFive financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)-(e) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), \nand \nthe \nindividual \nacted \nresponsibly \nunder \nthe \ncircumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant\u2019s conduct does not warrant full application of AG \u00b6 20(a) because \nthere is more than one delinquent debt and his financial problems are not isolated. It \nwas not until recently that these debts were paid or resolved. Therefore, his debt is \u201ca \ncontinuing course of conduct\u201d under the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence. See ISCR \nCase No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-03695 \n(App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)). He receives partial credit under AG \u00b6 20(a) because the \ndebt \u201coccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \n\n \n7 \n \n \n                                                          \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d  Under \nAG \u00b6 20(b), he receives full credit because the downfall in the economy was largely \nbeyond his control and he acted responsibly under the circumstances.1  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is not applicable because Applicant did not seek financial \ncounseling. He has, however, produced evidence that reflects he is living within his \nmeans and regained financial responsibility. Furthermore, there is sufficient \ninformation to establish full mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(d).2 Applicant has paid, is \npaying, or has otherwise resolved his debts. AG \u00b6 20(e) is not applicable because \nApplicant did not dispute the legitimacy of any of his debts.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \n \n1\u201cEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside \nhis [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable \nmanner when dealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. \n12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is \nwhether he maintained contact with his creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep \nhis debts current. \n \n2The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood-faith\u201d effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant \nmust present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \nsome other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive \ndoes not define the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the \nconcept of good-faith \u2018requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows \nreasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 Accordingly, \nan applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available \noption (such as bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating \ncondition].  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \n\n \n8 \n \n \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence.  \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must \nbe an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole-person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c).  \nThere is evidence against mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct. The SOR lists eight \ndebts totalling $39,218 that were at one time or another in various states of \ndelinquency. For two years, he failed to keep his accounts current or negotiate lesser \npayments, showing financial irresponsibility and lack of judgment. His lack of success \nin resolving delinquent debt until recently raises sufficient security concerns to merit \nfurther inquiry.   \n \nThe mitigating evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. \nApplicant\u2019s record of military service, community involvement, and good employment \nweighs in his favor. There is no evidence of any security violation during the time \nApplicant may have held a security clearance. He is a law-abiding citizen. All of his \nSOR debts are paid or resolved. His monthly expenses are current. The Appeal Board \nhas addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in financial cases, stating: \n \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201c\u2018meaningful track record\u2019\u201d necessarily includes evidence of \nactual debt reduction through payment of debts.\u201d However, an applicant \nis not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each \nand every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he has \u201c. . . established a plan to resolve his financial \nproblems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d The \nJudge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation and his actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant\u2019s \nplan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and \nrealistic. See Directive \u00b6  E2.2(a) (\u201cAvailable, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be \nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u201d) There is no requirement that a \nplan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. \nRather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for \nthe payment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no \nrequirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a \nreasonable debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. \n \nISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations omitted). \nApplicant is making a significant contribution to the national defense. His company \nfully supports him and recommends him for a security clearance. He made mistakes, \nand debts became delinquent. There is, however, simply no reason not to trust him. \nHe has paid his debts. Furthermore, he has established a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d of \ndebt payments. These factors show responsibility, rehabilitation, and mitigation. After \n\n \n9 \n \n \nweighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and \ncircumstances in the context of the whole person, I conclude he has mitigated the \nfinancial considerations security concerns.  \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful consideration of the whole person factors and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the adjudicative \nprocess, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the adjudicative guidelines. \nApplicant has fully mitigated or overcome the Government\u2019s case. For the reasons \nstated, I conclude he is eligible for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the \nSOR, as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. to 1.h.: \n For Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor a security clearance. Eligibility for a security clearance is granted. \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nRobert J. Tuider \nAdministrative Judge \n \n \n \n \n",

Accordingly, her request for a security clearance is granted. \n \n \nApplicant requested a security clearance by submitting an Electronic \nQuestionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) on November 13, 2008. After \nreviewing the results of the ensuing background investigation, adjudicators for the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) were unable to make a preliminary \naffirmative finding1 that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nApplicant\u2019s request.  \n \n1 Required by Executive Order 10865 and by DoD Directive 5220.6 (Directive), as amended. \nDecember 4, 2009\n\n \n \n2\n                                                \n \nOn June 30, 2009, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \nthat specified the basis for its decision: security concerns addressed in the Directive \nunder Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines \n(AG).2 Applicant signed her notarized Answer on July 20, 2009. She admitted to all \nallegations in the SOR except allegation 1.e. (see Procedural matters, below). She also \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel was prepared \nto proceed on August 31, 2009, and the case was assigned to me on September 4, \n2009. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on October 5, 2009, and I convened the \nhearing as scheduled on October 27, 2009. \n \nDuring the hearing, the government offered four exhibits, which I admitted as \nGovernment Exhibit (GE) 1 through 4. The government also offered a chart indicating \nthe status of Applicant's debts, which I marked as Hearing Exhibit I. Applicant testified \nand offered nine exhibits, admitted as Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AE) A through I. DOHA \nreceived the transcript (Tr.) on November 4, 2009. \n \nProcedural Matters \n \nApplicant\u2019s answer to the SOR did not indicate a response to allegation 1.e. At \nthe hearing, she admitted to the debt listed at \u00b6 1.e. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions to SOR allegations 1.a. through 1.f. are admitted as fact. \nAfter a thorough review of the pleadings, Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, and the \nrecord evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. \n \nApplicant, 42 years old, married in 1987 and divorced in 1993. She remarried in \n1997, and has two children, five and seven years of age, from her second marriage. \nBoth children live with Applicant and her husband. She is currently taking the final \ncourses to complete a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2010. She was unemployed until she and \nher husband started their own mortgage business in 2007. In 2008, after the business \nfailed, she worked for a private company in customer service, and shortly thereafter, \nbegan working for her current employer, a defense contractor, as a staff assistant (GE \n1; Tr. 43-44). \n \nWhile Applicant's husband worked as a realtor for approximately eight years, \ntheir credit rating was stable. In April 2007, Applicant and her husband started their own \n \n2 Adjudication of this case is controlled by the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, approved by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005,which were implemented by the Department of Defense on September \n1, 2006. The Revised Adjudicative Guidelines supersede the guidelines listed in Enclosure 2 to the \nDirective, and they apply to all adjudications or trustworthiness determinations in which an SOR was \nissued on or after September 1, 2006. \n\n \n \n3\n                                                \nmortgage loan business. They operated a small company, handling about six mortgage \napplications per month. The business was their sole source of income, and initially, it \ndid well. However, within a few months it started to founder because of the housing \nmarket crash, and the resulting economic crisis. When the business began to fail, \nApplicant and her husband liquidated their retirement account to pay their bills. They \nthen used cash advances on their credit cards to pay for their mortgage, utilities, and \nother expenses (GE 1, 4; AE B, E; Tr. 24, 42, 45-48). \n \nIn April 2008, Applicant's husband and two children were broadsided while \ndriving in their car. The children were not injured, but Applicant's husband suffered a \nback injury. He required several months of medical treatment and physical therapy and \nwas unable to work. They did not have medical insurance and paid for his medical \nexpenses out-of-pocket. Although the other party was found to be at fault, they have yet \nto be reimbursed for the medical expenses.3 Their insurance company paid the \nremaining balance on the wrecked car, but provided no additional funds to replace the \ncar. They were forced to purchase another car, and bought a used sedan; both of \nApplicant's cars are seven years old. During his medical treatment, Applicant's husband \nwas unable to participate in operating their mortgage business or caring for the children. \nApplicant tried to care for the home and children, and also operate the business (GE 1, \n2, 4; AE B, C; Tr. 59-62). \n \nApplicant and her husband were able to pay their mortgage and car loans. \nHowever, they could not also keep abreast of their credit card payments, and their credit \nreport started to show delinquencies in May 2008. The allegations in the SOR reflect \nthese unpaid accounts, which amount to approximately $77,000. Applicant contacted \nthe credit card company listed at \u00b6 1.a. and explained that she would not be able to pay \nanything in light of their limited income. She also tried to negotiate a settlement with the \ncredit card company at \u00b6 1.c., but was unsuccessful because, at the time, her husband \nwas not employed and she \u201cwas a one-income household.\u201d (Tr. 51, 70). \n \nEventually, the financial difficulties started to affect Applicant's ability to keep up \nwith payments on her first and second mortgages as well. However, she kept in touch \nwith the lender. In February 2009, she was able to negotiate a modification of the \nmortgage loan, which reduced her monthly payment by approximately $245 per month. \nHer payments have not been late since then. Her car loan payment has also been \ntimely since at least February 2009. Applicant does not use credit cards (GE 3, 4; AE G; \nTr. 25, 27, 65-69).  \n \nApplicant and her husband tried to keep their company operating, but could not. \nIn June 2008, she found employment, which provided medical benefits and an annual \nsalary of $30,000. Several months later, she accepted an offer at her current company \nfor a position that paid $41,600. Applicant is currently taking college courses, using her \ncompany\u2019s 100 percent tuition reimbursement benefit. After the next three courses, she \n \n3 The unreimbursed medical expenses are in Applicant's husband\u2019s name and are not alleged in the \nSOR (Tr. 62). \n\n \n \n4\nwill complete requirements for her bachelor\u2019s degree, which will qualify her to pursue \nhigher-paying positions within her company (GE 3; AE C; Tr. 26, 38, 42, 58-59). \n \nThe downturn in the real estate industry led Applicant's husband to change \ncareers. Although he began a nursing degree a few years ago, he has been unable to \ncomplete it, given the family\u2019s financial constraints. However, he recently completed \ntraining as a Certified Nursing Assistant (CNA). In September 2009, one month before \nthe hearing, he began employment at a local hospital. He plans to use the tuition \nreimbursement benefit from his current employer to complete his degree (Tr. 29-30, 88). \n \nApplicant's mother has provided financial assistance. She received funds from a \nwrongful death suit after her husband died from mesothelioma. She shared these funds \nwith her children, including Applicant. Over a period of about seven months, Applicant \nhas received gifts ranging from $600 to $2,500 from her mother. She used these funds \nto help pay the family\u2019s living expenses (Tr. 27-29). \n \nIn 2009, Applicant and her husband considered whether to file for bankruptcy. \nThey reviewed their income and debts, and decided that the best course for the family \nwould be to file a Chapter 7 petition. In January 2009, they paid a partial retainer to an \nattorney, and were able to pay the balance during the summer. As of October 16, 2009, \nthe attorney planned to file the petition within the month (AE E; Tr. 30, 33, 79).  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s base salary is $41,600. Her gross earnings for 2009 will be $46,000, \nwhich includes overtime hours. When she began working for a private employer (June \nto September 2008), her net monthly income was $1,981. Her net monthly expenses \nwere $3,649, leaving a net monthly remainder of negative $1,668. In her current job, \nshe earns $2,878 net per month, which leaves a net monthly remainder of negative \n$771. However, her husband\u2019s new job adds net monthly income of $1,380. With this \nadditional income, Applicant's monthly net remainder is now $609. Applicant's \nhusband\u2019s job, which began in September 2009, pays approximately $22,000 per year. \nTheir joint net annual income is approximately $50,000 (AE F; Tr. 78).  \n \nApplicant received several awards for her work during her first year of \nemployment. Character reference letters from her manager and traffic/logistics lead \nattest to her competence, timeliness, and commitment to her job. She was also cited for \nher security awareness during an on-site security inspection in September 2009. \nApplicant\u2019s security manager noted that Applicant initiated a discussion with him about \nher financial difficulties from the start of her security processing. She kept him aware of \nher debts payments and was forthcoming at all times (AE H, I). \n \nPolicies \n \n \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the Revised \n\n \n \n5\n                                                \nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG).4 Decisions must also reflect consideration of the \u201cwhole \nperson\u201d factors listed in \u00b6 2(a) of the Guidelines. \n \n \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an Applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. In this case, the pleadings and the information presented by the parties \nrequire consideration of the security concerns and adjudicative factors addressed under \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations).   \n \n \nA security clearance decision is intended only to resolve the questions of whether \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest5 for an Applicant to either receive or \ncontinue to have access to classified information. The government bears the initial \nburden of producing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision \nto deny or revoke a security clearance for an Applicant. Additionally, the government \nmust be able to prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets \nits burden, it then falls to the Applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s \ncase. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an Applicant bears a heavy \nburden of persuasion.6 A person who has access to classified information enters into a \nfiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the \ngovernment has a compelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the \nrequisite judgment, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national \ninterests as his or her own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard \ncompels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in \nfavor of the government.7 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) \n \nAG \u00b618 expresses the security concern pertaining to financial considerations: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \n \n4 Directive. 6.3. \n5 See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988). \n6 See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531. \n7 See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b). \n\n \n \n6\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially over-\nextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nCompulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes \nincluding espionage. Affluence that cannot be explained by known \nsources of income is also a security concern. It may indicate proceeds \nfrom financially profitable criminal acts. \n \n \nApplicant had good credit until her business failed as a result of the recent \nmortgage crisis. She used credit card cash advances to pay living expenses and was \nunable to repay them timely. Applicant\u2018s credit reports show that she has had \ndelinquencies since May 2008. Both disqualifying conditions AG \u00b619(a) (inability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts) and AG \u00b619(c) (a history of not meeting financial \nobligations) apply. The record contains no evidence of other disqualifying conditions \nsuch as frivolous spending, or debts related to alcoholism, gambling or deceptive \npractices.  \n \n \nThe Financial Considerations guideline also contains conditions that can \nmitigate security concerns. In this case, AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and 20(b) are relevant. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) applies. Applicant's \ndelinquencies, which began in 2008, are recent. However, lack of recency is not the \nonly element that mitigates under AG \u00b6 20(a). Applicant's inability to pay arose from \none of the worst financial crises in recent memory, and it is unlikely that she will find \nherself in such circumstances in the future. Moreover, Applicant had solid credit before \nthe mortgage crisis, she made diligent efforts to keep as many of her accounts up-to-\ndate as she could, and she did not spend money in a negligent or frivolous manner. \nApplicant's response to her delinquencies showed good judgment, and her \ntrustworthiness is not in doubt.  \n \n \n \nApplicant chose to start a mortgage lending business just before the mortgage \ncrisis began. She had no way to foresee or control that event, which played havoc with \nher finances. In addition, Applicant's husband sustained a back injury in a car accident. \nShe could not have foreseen this event, or the unexpected medical expenses, months \nof therapy, and lost capability that resulted from it. Applicant has acted responsibly: she \nimmediately obtained employment, enabling her to pay her mortgage and car loan, so \nthat she could keep her family in the home, and have reliable transportation to her job. \nWhen she received funds from her mother, she used them to pay bills. She obtained a \nmodification of her mortgage, which reduced her monthly payment considerably. Her \nsalary, along with the income from her husband\u2019s new job, has brought her from a \nnegative monthly remainder to a positive remainder within approximately 18 months. \nApplicant has provided sufficient evidence that she has not ignored her financial \nobligations and has acted responsibly over the past year-and-a-half. AG \u00b6 20(b) \napplies (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the \n\n \n \n7\nperson's control [e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation], and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances).  \n \nWhole Person Analysis \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate the \nApplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s conduct and \nall the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 2(c) requires that the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. Under each guideline, I \nconsidered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts \nand circumstances surrounding this case.  \n \n \nApplicant's delinquencies stem from factors beyond her control. Until 2008, \nApplicant had no delinquent debts. However, she and her husband chose to start a \nmortgage business just before the start of the national mortgage crisis. Along with \nmillions of others, they did not foresee what was coming. Another unforeseeable event \noccurred when Applicant's husband was injured in an automobile accident and required \nseveral months of therapy. Trying to support her family initially on the income from a \nfailing mortgage business, and with an unemployed spouse, and later, on one salary of \n$30,000 per year, was not possible without incurring delinquencies.  \n \n \nOver the past year-and-a-half, Applicant has taken numerous steps to resolve \nthe situation: she obtained employment to ensure steady income and to obtain medical \nbenefits. When it did not pay enough, she secured a higher paying job. Currently, she \nis using the free tuition benefit to earn a degree to further increase her future earning \npotential. Her husband is employed in a new field, and plans to use the free tuition \nbenefit through his current employer to complete his nursing degree. Applicant \nnegotiated a mortgage loan modification, and is now paying lower monthly payments. \nShe has, with her husband, turned their negative net remainder to a positive cash flow. \nFinally, she hired an attorney to assist her in resolving her debts through bankruptcy. \nApplicant has made significant improvements in her financial situation in the past 18 \n\n \n \n8\nmonths, despite supporting four people on approximately $50,000 per year. Applicant \nwas also candid and forthright with her security manager about her financial problems, \nand her coworkers attest to her reliability and sense of responsibility.  \n \n \nOverall, the record evidence satisfies the doubts raised about Applicant\u2019s \nsuitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has \nmitigated the security concerns arising from the cited adjudicative guideline. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F  \n \n \nFOR Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. \u2013 1.f.  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, It is \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to allow Applicant access to \nclassified information.

The action was taken under\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February\n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2,1992), as amended\n(Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines (Ags) implemented by DoD on September 1,\n2006. \nApplicant responded to the SOR on December 19, 2009. The case was assigned\nto me on March 15, 2010, and was scheduled for hearing on April 15, 2010.  A hearing\nwas held on the scheduled date. At the hearing, the Government's case consisted of 13\nSeptember 28, 2010\n\n2\nexhibits (GE). Applicant relied on one witness (himself) and one exhibit (AE). All of the\nexhibits were received in evidence without objection. The transcript (Tr.) was received on\nApril 23, 2010. \nProcedural Issues and Rulings\nBefore the close of the hearing, Applicant requested the record be kept open to\nafford him the opportunity to supplement the record with a signed version of his pre-\nprosecution diversion program (PPD) acceptance and duration of the program, character\nreferences, and performance evaluations. For good cause shown, Applicant was granted\nseven days to supplement the record. The Government was afforded two days to\nrespond. Within the time permitted, Applicant provided a character reference from his\nsupervisor, a signed version of his PPD acceptance and order suspending criminal\nproceedings, community college enrollment records, civilian employer performance\nevaluations, and non-commissioned officer (NCO) fitness evaluations. Applicant\u2019s\nsubmissions were admitted as Applicant\u2019s exhibits B through G.\nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline J, Applicant allegedly was arrested on five different occasions\nbetween 1996 and July 2009 on assorted charges. Besides his arrests, he allegedly\naccepted Article 15 non-judicial punishment (NJP) for an improper relationship with a\ntrainee in August 2006. Under Guideline E, Applicant allegedly falsified his Electronic\nQuestionnaire for National Security Positions (e-QIP) he completed in September 2008,\nwhen he failed to list his alcohol-related arrest in December 2006. \nIn his December 2009 response to the SOR, Applicant admitted several of the\nallegations, but denied others.  He admitted his1996 marijuana possession arrest, his\ndriving under the influence arrest (DUI) in October 1997, his Article 15 punishment, and\nhis July 2009 arrest for child abuse, but denied each of the remaining allegations. He\ndenied any arrests for minor in possession or damage to private property while under the\ninfluence of alcohol. He also denied falsifying his e-QIP. He provided explanations for\neach of the alleged arrests and offenses in the SOR.\n      \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 32-year-old technician for a defense contractor who seeks a\nsecurity clearance.  The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by Applicant are\nadopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional findings follow.\nBackground and arrest history \nApplicant enlisted in the Army a short time after he graduated from high school in\nMay 1996 (GE 1).  He was honorably discharged in August 2008. (GE 3)  He is married\nand has two children. (GE 2). Applicant is currently a full-time student at a local\ncommunity college. (See AE D; Tr. 56)  He documents excellent academic credits. \n\n3\nApplicant was arrested on a number of occasions between September 1996 and\nJuly 2009.  Records document his arrest for marijuana in possession in 1996 (GE 4; Tr.\n38-39), and his minor in possession arrest the same year. (GEs 4) Applicant claims both\ncharges were dismissed (Tr. 43-44), but provides no written proof. Government\nsubmissions provide no documentary proof of dispositions relative to either arrest.\nApplicant has not \u201ctouched\u201d or used marijuana since his 1996 arrest. (Tr. 39)\nIn October 1997, Applicant was arrested for DUI and traffic infractions.  Records\nshow that he was found guilty of all counts and sentenced to 12 months probation, 48\nhours of jail, and community service, and was fined. (GE 4) In March 2006, Applicant\naccepted the award of Article 15 NJP for an improper relationship with a trainee.  He was\nstripped in rank from sergeant to specialist, and had his pay reduced by one-half for two\nmonths. (GE  5) \nApplicant was arrested in December 2006 and charged with damage to private\nproperty while under the influence of alcohol. (GE ). Applicant and his wife had engaged\nin a verbal argument, and she locked him out of their base quarters. (Tr. 40-41) He\nresponded by attempting to force entry into the quarters, which resulted in a dented door\nand broken window. (See GE 7; Tr. 40). He had consumed a \u201ccouple of drinks that\nnight,\u201d but was not under the influence, and  was never administered a field sobriety or\nblood-alcohol (BAC) test. (Tr. 40)  Still, he attended a two-day alcohol education class as\nthe result of the incident. (Tr. 41)\nAfter the 2006 incident, Applicant went to a military police (MP) station on base\nand filed a written statement of what happened. (GE 7).  He was never informed of any\narrest or charges. When the investigating officer followed up on his report and came to\nhis quarters, Applicant told the officer what transpired between himself and his wife. After\ntaking a brief statement from Applicant, the officer transported him to another MP station,\nwhere he was processed and released to his unit. (GE 7)  Following his release,\nApplicant reported the incident to his security office. Records show that his reported\nincident was treated by his command as an alcohol-related incident. (GE 8) Based on\nwhat was reported, Applicant\u2019s command issued an oral reprimand to Applicant that was\ntreated as an adverse personnel action. (GE 8; Tr. 41-42)\nIn July 2009, Applicant was arrested and charged with two counts (felonies) of\nintentional child abuse (no death or great bodily harm). He was recovering from back\nsurgery, and used a belt to discipline his young daughters. (Tr. 54) The belt he struck his\ndaughters with left marks. (Tr. 53) \nApplicant agreed to deferred prosecution of the child abuse charges made against\nhim. The agreement he was asked to sign was conditioned on his accepting court-\nordered counseling and other conditions, at a cost of $30 a month. (AE A and C; Tr. 45-\n46, 53-54)  Applicant executed the pre-prosecution diversion (PPD) agreement with the\ndistrict attorney in March 2010. (See AEs A and C) He accepted the underlying felony\ncharges which can be used against him should he ever be terminated from the program.\nUnder the PPD program\u2019s terms, should applicant withdraw from the program at any\n\n4\ntime, the district attorney may resume prosecution at any time.  Violation of any terms of\nhis PPD program is grounds for his termination.  (AEs A and C)   \nUpon his acceptance of the terms and conditions of his PDD agreement, the court\nwith jurisdiction over the case entered an order suspending criminal proceedings. (AE D)\nIncluded in the order was a clause permitting the reopening of criminal proceedings in\nthe event Applicant\u2019s participation in his PPD program was terminated for cause. (AE D) \nApplicant is required to meet with his diversion counselor twice a month, and last\nmet with his counselor just before the hearing. (Tr. 54-55)  Applicant currently performs\ncommunity service and attends class for educational credits, as well as classes under\nthe court-supervised PPD program. He hopes to complete his approved diversion\nprogram within next 22 weeks. (Tr. 45) \nCourt documents confirm that Applicant was expected to complete at least six\nmonths of counseling and community service, and up to 24 months in the diversion\nprogram. (AEs A and C; Tr. 46)  Whether or not he will complete his diversion program in\n22 weeks cannot be determined from the documentation produced in this hearing. \nWhile several of the alleged charges involved drinking associated with the actions\nthat resulted in his arrests, only one of the charges involved documented alcohol abuse:\nhis 1997 DUI arrest for which he was found guilty. Applicant denies drinking at the\napartment where he was arrested with others in 1996, and there are no probative\nfindings in the record to challenge his claims. The balance of the evidentiary record lacks\nany probative evidence of Applicant\u2019s abusing alcohol since his 1997 DUI incident.\nE-QIP omissions\nAsked to complete a security clearance application in September 2008, Applicant\nomitted his 2006 damage to private property (alcohol) incident. Applicant denies any\nintent to omit his December 2006 incident, and assures he did not know he was arrested\nor charged with damage to private property. (Tr. 44) \nWhile the incident reports covering the underlying incident recite the details of\nApplicant\u2019s reported verbal altercation with his wife in December 2006, they do not\nrecord any arrest or indications of excessive alcohol consumption. (GEs 6 and 7) The\ncommander\u2019s report classifies the incident as damage to private property (alcohol), and\nnotes the issuance of an oral reprimand.  However, the commander\u2019s report does not\nprovide any information about whether Applicant was arrested and charged as the result\nof his reported incident. \nWhile Applicant\u2019s apprehension and processing by military investigating officers\ncan be treated as an arrest, there are no indications in the incident reports that Applicant\nwas notified of an arrest, and advised of his rights.  Applicant\u2019s claims that he was never\ntold by investigating officers that he was placed under arrest and charged with a crime\nare plausible under the circumstances and credible. His explanations are accepted.\n\n5\nEndorsements\nApplicant is well-regarded by his employer. His direct supervisor described\nApplicant as a valued member of his work team. (AE B)  His civilian performance\nevaluations and NCO military fitness reports covering his last six years of active duty\n(2003-2008) credit him with success in all phases of his assigned responsibilities and\ncovered elements. (AEs F and G). \nPolicies\nThe AGs list guidelines to be used by administrative judges in the decision-\nmaking process covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that\ncould create a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as\nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information. \nThese guidelines include \"[c]onditions that could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying\u201d (disqualifying conditions), if any, and many of the \"[c]onditions that\ncould mitigate security concerns.\u201d They must be considered before deciding whether or\nnot a security clearance should be granted, continued, or denied. The guidelines do not\nrequire administrative judges to place exclusive reliance on the enumerated disqualifying\nand mitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a decision. Each of the\nguidelines is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person in accordance with AG \u00b6\n2(c) \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, administrative judges must take into account the\npertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in AG \u00b6 2(a)\nof the revised AGs, which are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and\nimpartial commonsense decision based upon a careful consideration of the pertinent\nguidelines within the context of the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed\nto examine a sufficient period of an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be\nmade about whether the applicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be\nconsidered together with the following AG \u00b6 2(a) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and\nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral chances; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication\npolicy concerns are pertinent herein:\n\n6\nCriminal Conduct\nThe Concern: Criminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.  (AG \u00b6 30)\nPersonal Conduct\nThe Concern: Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness,\nunreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and\nregulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability\nto protect classified information.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and\ncandid answers during the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate\nwith the security clearance process.  (AG, \u00b6 15)\nAlcohol Consumption\nThe Concern: Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of\nquestionable judgment, or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. (AG, \u00b6 21)\nBurden of Proof\nUnder the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an applicant's request for\nsecurity clearance may be made only upon a threshold finding that to do so is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires administrative\njudges to make a commonsense appraisal of the evidence accumulated in the record,\nthe ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a security clearance depends, in\nlarge part, on the relevance and materiality of that evidence. As with all adversarial\nproceedings, the judge may draw only those inferences which have a reasonable and\nlogical basis from the evidence of record. \nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove by substantial\nevidence any controverted facts alleged in the SOR; and (2) it must demonstrate that the\nfacts proven have a material bearing to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a\nsecurity clearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, does not require\nthe Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled\nor abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security clearance.\nRather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant may\ndeliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the burden of proof shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or his security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or\nmitigation of the Government's case.  Because Executive Order 10865 requires that all\nsecurity clearances be clearly consistent with the national interest, \u201csecurity-clearance\ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d See Department of the\nNavy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\n\n7\nAnalysis  \nApplicant is a respected employee of a defense contractor who has a\nconsiderable history of arrests (one alcohol-related). Concerns are raised over\nApplicant\u2019s criminal arrest history, and particularly his most recent child abuse charges\nthat he admitted to as part of his court-diversion program.  Initial concerns are raised,\ntoo, over his e-QIP omissions of his alcohol-related arrests and the evidence of alcohol\nabuse associated with at least his 1997 DUI arrest and conviction.   \nCriminal conduct and alcohol concerns\nApplicant\u2019s arrest history (some alcohol-related) raises important concerns about\nhis risk of recurrent alcohol abuse. On the strength of the evidence presented, one\ndisqualifying condition (DC) of the AG for alcohol consumption (AG \u00b6 21) may be\napplied: DC \u00b6 22(a), \u201calcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while\nunder the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace or other\nincidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol\nabuser or alcohol dependent.\u201d \nBecause the offense is classed as a criminal offense, it is covered by DC \u00b6 31(a)\nof the criminal conduct guideline: \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses.\u201d\nAnd because Applicant is still on probation, DC \u00b6 31(d), \u201cindividual is currently on parole\nor probation,\u201d applies as well to his situation. Applicant\u2019s DUI offense would appear to\nqualify as a serious crime, but without a definition section in this guideline,  it is less than\nclear.\nDespite the seriousness of his October 1997 DUI offense, Applicant does not\nbelieve he is an alcohol abuser, and claims no involvement in alcohol-related incidents\nafter 1997.  Applicant\u2019s claims have some merit.  For outside of his 1997 DUI, there is\nscant proof of any alcohol involved with his 1996 and 2006 offenses, or in any other\ndocumented incident.  Since his DUI incident he assures he has not been involved in any\nother alcohol-related incident, and has not abused alcohol in any way since his 1997 DUI\noffense.  Absent firm evidence to the contrary, Applicant\u2019s assurances are accepted. \nBased on the isolated nature of his alcohol-related offense, Applicant may rely on\none of the mitigating conditions of the alcohol guideline: MC \u00b6 22(a), \u201c so much time has\npassed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it happened under such unusual\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d  MC \u00b6 32(a), \u201cso much time has elapsed\nsince the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances\nthat it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d of the criminal conduct guideline also applies to\nApplicant\u2019s situation.\nTaking into account Applicant\u2019s very limited history of alcohol abuse (defined by\nthe two proven alcohol-related incidents, conclusions warrant that his overall alcohol\nhistory reflect sufficient evidence of sustained commitment to responsible alcohol\nconsumption to ensure that he is not at any risk of recurrent alcohol abuse.  With little\n\n8\nhistory of alcohol abuse before his DUI incident and renewed commitments to avoiding\nany drinking and driving in the future, he is a sound risk not to repeat any of the mistakes\nthat contributed to his 1997 DUI offense.  Considering the record as a whole, Applicant\nmakes a convincing showing that he has the strength and stability to avert any recurrent\nproblems with judgment lapses related to alcohol.  Applicant\u2019s mitigation efforts are\nenough to warrant safe predictions that he is no longer at risk to judgment impairment\nassociated with alcohol abuse. Favorable conclusions warrant with respect to the\nallegations covered by the alcohol guidelines of the SOR. \nMore difficult to reconcile with minimum requirements of security clearance\neligibility are Applicant\u2019s admitted child abuse charges.  While prosecution of these\ncharges has been suspended (conditioned on his satisfactory participation in his court-\napproved PPD program), he admitted the underlying conduct which is covered by the\ntwo felony counts filed against him. Because he is still an active participant in the\ndiversion program, with some months to go before he can be credited with completion\nand eligibility for dismissal of the charges, it is premature to discount them.\nPotentially available mitigating conditions are MC \u00b632(a), \u201cso much time has\nelapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under such unusual\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d and MC \u00b632(d), \u201cthere is evidence of\nsuccessful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time without\nrecurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher education,\ngood employment record, or constructive community involvement.\u201d   Because of the\nnumber of criminal incidents in Applicant\u2019s past, and the relative recency and\nseriousness of his child abuse charges, these two mitigating conditions have limited\napplication to his situation.  \nEvaluating Applicant\u2019s actions under the criminal conduct guidelines, and from a\nwhole-person perspective, there is much to commend. He documents meritorious civilian\nand military service and exhibits good progress with his work and schooling. \nMoreover, Applicant\u2019s earlier 1996 and 1997 charges involve substance abuse\nand are quite old. Alcohol concerns associated with these offenses are mitigated, and\nthe risks of any recurrent incidents involving DUI offenses are very small. Applicant\u2019s\nArticle 15 punishment and reprimand stemming from his reported damage to property\nincident are also mitigated.  There have been no recurrent incidents involving similar\nbehavior and no arrests or charges arising out of his 2006 damage to property incident.\nMoreover, Applicant\u2019s overall military and civilian contributions warrant conclusions that\nthe conduct associated with allegations 1.a through 1.e are mitigated. \nMitigation is not available to Applicant, however, with respect to his child abuse\ncharges. The suspended child abuse charges are much too serious and recent to\nmitigate without a considerable period of seasoning to convince he has the strength and\nstability to avert any recurrent problems with judgment lapses related to criminal child\nabuse.  Unfavorable conclusions warrant with respect to the allegations covered by the\nsubparagraph 1.f of the criminal conduct  guideline of the SOR. \n\n9\nApplicant\u2019s omissions\nApplicant omitted his 2006 property damage (alcohol) incident from the e-QIP he\ncompleted in September 2008.  Applicant does not challenge the omission. But he does\ncontest the claim that an arrest and charge resulted from his reported incident.  The\nincident reports in evidence make no mention of an arrest or charge.  And Applicant\u2019s\nacceptance of a verbal reprimand is consistent with Applicant\u2019s claims that no arrest or\ncharge occurred.  \nTaking into account all of the circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s reported\n2006 damage to property incident, conclusions warrant that the allegations are\nunsubstantiated.  Favorable conclusions are warranted with respect to the allegations\ncovered by Guideline E. \nIn reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including\neach of the factors and conditions enumerated in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs.\nFormal Findings \nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR in the context of the findings of fact,\nconclusions, and the factors and conditions listed above, I make the following separate\nformal findings with respect to Applicant's eligibility for a security clearance.\nGUIDELINE J (CRIMINAL CONDUCT):           \nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparas 1.a through 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubpara  1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nGUIDELINE E (PERSONAL CONDUCT):\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubpara. 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nGUIDELINE G (ALCOHOL CONSIDERATIONS):\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubpara 3.a:\nFor Applicant\nConclusions\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant's security\nclearance.

Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance is granted. \n \nOn June 1, 2011, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline B. \nThe action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) \neffective within the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006. \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on June 17, 2011, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on July 29, 2011. DOHA issued \na Notice of Hearing on August 9, 2011. I convened the hearing as scheduled on August \n31, 2011. The Government offered Exhibit (GE) 1. Applicant did not object and it was \nadmitted into evidence. The Government requested administrative notice be taken of \n \n1 \n \n \nSeptember 23, 2011\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                          \nHearing Exhibit I.1 I granted the request.

DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on September 8, \n2011.  \n \nProcedural Matters \n \n \n \nDepartment Counsel withdrew SOR \u00b61.a. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR. I have included her \nadmission in my findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, \nexhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 52 years old. She worked for a federal contractor for six years as a \nlogistics manager. Applicant was born in Madagascar and met her husband there in \n1979. He was a U. S. Marine at the time serving with the Marine Security Guard at the \nU.S. embassy. Prior to him transferring in January 1981, Applicant applied for and was \ngranted a fianc\u00e9e visa so she could accompany him to the United States and they could \nlater marry. Applicant\u2019s husband reported to his new embassy assignment in Costa \nRica. Applicant lived with her husband\u2019s parents during this time awaiting their pending \nnuptials. Their plan was to marry in Costa Rica after he got settled. In March 1981, \nbefore they were married, Applicant\u2019s husband and other Marines were targeted by \nterrorists and a bomb exploded, hitting them on their way to work. Her husband suffered \nsevere injuries, including having both of his femurs shattered. They moved up their \nwedding date and were married in June 1981. Her husband was awarded the Purple \nHeart. After numerous operations he was medically retired in 1984 and receives \ndisability compensation. Applicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1988.2  \n \n \nApplicant and her husband have two daughters. Their eldest is 28 years old and \nthey have a 15-year-old adopted daughter. They also have two granddaughters. In \n1996, Applicant returned to Madagascar to attend the funeral of her sister. This is the \nonly time since she left in 1981 that she has returned. Her deceased sister had a baby \ndaughter who was 11 months old at the time. The father of the child was unable to care \nfor the baby and asked Applicant to adopt her. Applicant and her husband agreed to \nadopt the baby. They consulted with the U.S. embassy in Madagascar to ensure they \nfollowed the proper procedures. They were advised that they needed to complete the \nadoption before the child could obtain a U.S. visa. Applicant remained in Madagascar \nfor three to four months to complete the process. Once the child was legally adopted the \nproper visa and paperwork were issued, and Applicant and child returned to the United \nStates. Upon entry into the United States, Applicant and her husband filed a Petition of \n \n1 HE II is Applicant\u2019s written closing statement.  \n \n2 Tr.40-47, 61-62. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                                          \nU.S. Residency with the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service (USCIS).3 They were \ninformed by USCIS that they would receive additional documentation from the agency in \nthe future. They never received additional documentation from the USCIS. They made \nan appointment with USCIS in early 2011 and were advised that during the transition \nfrom the U.S. Immigration Service to USCIS their paperwork was lost, so they had to \nresubmit it and start over. Applicant and her husband have resubmitted the appropriate \ndocuments for permanent residence status for their adopted daughter. Applicant \nadmitted after they adopted their daughter and first submitted the required documents to \nUSCIS, they forgot about following through, and they moved on with their lives raising \ntheir daughters. They did not think about their daughter\u2019s citizenship status. Their \nadopted daughter is in the United States legally.4  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s father, stepmother, four brothers, and sister are citizens and residents \nof Madagascar. She has had minimal contact with all of them since leaving in 1981. She \ntelephones them on holidays and birthdays. The last time she visited any family \nmembers in Madagascar was in 1996 when she returned for her sister\u2019s funeral. She \nhas no plans to return there.5  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s father is a 78-year-old retired businessman. Before he retired he \nowned a hardware store. He recently had a stroke and Applicant has called him on the \ntelephone more often. Her father never served in the military and does not receive any \npension or benefit from the government. He has never visited Applicant in the United \nStates. Her father remarried seven years ago. His wife, Applicant\u2019s stepmother, is a 66-\nyear-old housewife. She never served in the military and does not receive any benefits \nfrom the government.6  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s brothers\u2019 ages are 57, 55, 51, and 44. Her eldest brother owns a \nrestaurant. He is married. His wife is a homemaker. They have one child, 18 years old. \nNeither he nor his wife has served in the military or receive government benefits.7  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s second brother is retired from the military. He is married. His wife is a \nhomemaker. They have two children, ages 19 and 17. He enlisted in the country\u2019s \nCoast Guard and served twenty years. He receives a military pension. He retired from \nthe military about ten years ago.

Except for his pension they do not receive any other benefit from \nthe government.8  \n \nApplicant\u2019s third brother sells cars. He is married and has two sons, ages, 25 and \n22. The sons are required to register with the country\u2019s selected service, but they have \nnot been called to serve in the military. His wife is a homemaker. Neither he nor his wife \nserved in the military and neither receives any benefit from the government.9  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s youngest brother sells cars. He is married and has three children, \nages 10, 8, and 5. Neither he nor his wife has served in the military. His wife works for \nthe government\u2019s Department of Agriculture as a land surveyor.10  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s sister is a homemaker. Applicant does not know her sister\u2019s \nhusband\u2019s occupation. Her sister did not serve in the military and does not work for the \ngovernment.11  \n \n \nApplicant talks to her relatives in Madagascar, but on a very limited basis. \nUsually it is on holidays and other special occasions.  \n \n \nApplicant owned a small piece of land in Madagascar that she inherited from her \nmother. It is adjacent to land owned by a brother. Applicant relinquished the land to her \nbrother in 2010 so he would have more property for his home. Applicant has no \nintention of going back to Madagascar to live.12  \n \nApplicant is her immediate family\u2019s primary means of support due to her \nhusband\u2019s disability.

Madagascar became a French \nProtectorate in 1985. \n \n \nMadagascar has been marred by a recent period of upheaval. In 2009, protestors \ndemonstrated in the capital and the president signed power over to the military, which in \nturned conferred the presidency on the elected mayor of its capital city, Antananarivo, \nand the leader of the demonstrators. The last presidential elections were held in \nDecember 2006. There is currently no legitimately elected president of Madagascar.  \n \n \nThe United States has condemned the unconstitutional and undemocratic \nchange in power and considers the events that led up to the installation of the present \ngovernment to be a de facto military coup. As a result, the United States has suspended \nall assistance programs that directly benefit the government as well as all non-\nhumanitarian assistance.  \n \n \nMadagascar\u2019s human rights record is troubling. There are numerous human \nrights problems, such as unlawful killings and other security forces abuses, harsh prison \nconditions, arbitrary arrest and detention, censorship, intimidation, arrest and violence \ntoward journalists, societal discrimination, violence and trafficking in woman and \nchildren, and forced child labor. \n \n \nThere are reports that government agents committed arbitrary and unlawful \nkillings and the police continue to use unwarranted lethal force during arrests. \n  \n \nAfter the de facto military coup, the United States has had limited engagement \nwith the defector authorities, There is continued political unrest and the country\u2019s limited \nresources severely constrain its ability to confront a potential terrorist threat.  \n \n \nThere are no current travel warnings issued by the United States for \nMadagascar. U.S. citizens visiting should not expect any hostility or aggressions based \nsolely on their citizenship. However, there are warnings about crimes against tourists in \ngeneral and recommendations to take appropriate precautions.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \n\n \n6 \n \n \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \nAG \u00b6 6 expresses the security concern regarding foreign influence:  \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \n\n \n7 \n \n \n                                                          \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism. \n \nAG \u00b6 7 describes disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern. I \nhave considered all of them and the following two are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information. \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) require evidence of a \u201cheightened risk.\u201d The \u201cheightened \nrisk\u201d necessary to raise one of these disqualifying conditions is a relatively low standard. \n\u201cHeightened risk\u201d denotes a risk greater than the normal risk inherent in having a family \nmember living under a foreign government or owning property in a foreign country. The \ntotality of Applicant\u2019s family ties to a foreign country as well as each individual family tie \nmust be considered.  \n \nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States. \u201cThe United \nStates has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information \nfrom any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, \nregardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to \nthose of the United States.\u201d15 \n \nFurthermore, \u201ceven friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the \nUnited States over matters they view as important to their vital interests or national \nsecurity.\u201d16 Friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the United States, \nespecially in the economic, scientific, and technical fields. Nevertheless, the nature of a \nnation\u2019s government, its relationship with the U.S., and its human rights record are \nrelevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable to \ngovernment coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater \nif the foreign country has an authoritarian government, or the country is known to \nconduct intelligence operations against the U.S. Madagascar\u2019s poor human rights \nrecord, the unconstitutional and undemocratic change of power resulting in a de facto \nmilitary coup, and the country\u2019s limited resources constraining their ability to confront \npotential terrorist threats creates a heightened risk.  \n \n \n15 ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004). \n \n16 ISCR Case No. 00-0317, 2002 DOHA LEXIS 83 at **15-16 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2002). \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s father, stepmother, four brothers, and sister are citizens and residents \nof Madagascar. These facts potentially create a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion, and also create a potential conflict of \ninterest. I find AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) apply. Department Counsel withdrew the allegation \nagainst Applicant\u2019s adopted daughter. Therefore, none of the above disqualifying \nconditions apply to her. \n \nI have also analyzed all of the facts and considered all of the mitigating conditions \nfor this security concern under AG \u00b6 8 and conclude the following three are potentially \napplicable: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationship with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization and interests of the U.S.;  \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interests in favor of the U.S. interests; and \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \n \nApplicant has had minimal contact with her family since she left Madagascar in \n1981. She returned one time in 1996 for her sister\u2019s funeral. She telephones family \nmembers only on special occasions. None of her family have visited her in the United \nStates. However, because Applicant still maintains contact with them her family ties are \nmore than casual. Therefore, I find AG \u00b6 8(c) does not apply.  \n \n \nThe United States presently does not have diplomatic ties with Madagascar, \nexcept for humanitarian purposes. The United States has condemned the \nunconstitutional and undemocratic change of power through a de facto military coup. \nMadagascar\u2019s human rights record is poor and troubling. There are reports that \nGovernment agents committed arbitrary and unlawful killings and the police continue to \nuse unwarranted lethal force during arrests. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress \nis significantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family \nmember is associated with or dependent upon the government or the country is known \nto conduct intelligence operations against the U.S.  \n \nApplicant was born in Madagascar, but moved to the United States in 1981 and \nmarried her husband, a U.S. Marine. She has been a naturalized U.S. citizen since \n1988. Her eldest daughter and grandchildren were born in the United States. She has \n\n \n9 \n \n \nreturned to Madagascar only one time to attend her sister\u2019s funeral. She stayed until \nshe could complete the procedure to adopt her sister\u2019s child and bring her back to the \nUnited States. The only asset Applicant had in Madagascar was a small piece of land \nthat is adjacent to her brother\u2019s land that she inherited from her mother. She \nrelinquished this land to her brother. Applicant does not intend on returning to \nMadagascar. Only one family member, her brother, who retired from the military, has \nany ties to the government. There is no indication that Applicant\u2019s relatives are in \npositions or involved in activities that would place Applicant in a position of having to \nchoose between her family interests and those of the United States. There is no \nindication that Madagascar targets or exploits its own citizens to obtain intelligence. It is \nunlikely that intelligence officials would attempt to pressure Applicant\u2019s relatives in \nMadagascar to gather valuable or classified information from the United States through \nApplicant. In addition, I find that considering Applicant\u2019s deep and longstanding \nrelationship and loyalties to the United States, that any potential conflict of interest that \nmay arise would be resolved in favor of the United States. I find mitigating conditions \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 8 (a) and 8(b) apply. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline B in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. Applicant has \nbeen a loyal and dedicated citizen of the United States since 1988. Her husband is a \nretired Marine. Her eldest daughter was born in the United States and her adopted \ndaughter has lived with her since 1996. Applicant left Madagascar in 1981 and has only \nreturned once for her sister\u2019s funeral. She talks to her family occasionally. Although she \nhas family contacts in Madagascar, her loyalty and commitment is to the United States. \n\n \n10 \n \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with no questions or doubts about Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant mitigated the security concerns arising under the guideline for Foreign \nInfluence.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph   1.a:  \n \n \nWithdrawn \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.b-1.e: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nCarol G.

The case was assigned to me on May 16, 2011. DOHA issued \nAugust 30, 2011\n\n \n2 \n \na notice of hearing on June 16, 2011, and the hearing was convened as scheduled on \nJuly 12, 2011.  \n \nThe Government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 13. GE 1 through 12 were \nadmitted without objection. The Government did not provide Applicant with prior notice \nthat it was submitting GE 13. Applicant objected to its admission. Applicant was given \nuntil July 29, 2011, to submit a request to reconvene to address GE 13. No request to \nreconvene was made. GE 13 is admitted. Applicant testified and submitted Exhibits \n(AE) A, A(1) through A(6), and B. AE A, A(2) through A(6), and B were admitted without \nobjection. AE(1) was admitted over the Government\u2019s objection. The record was held \nopen until August 5, 2011, for Applicant to submit additional information. No additional \nmaterial was submitted. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on July 20, 2011. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 51-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He is on unpaid \nleave pending his security clearance adjudication. He is a high school graduate. He \nmarried in 1977 and divorced in 1987. He married his current wife in 1990.

If income, social security, and Medicare taxes that a \ncorporation must withhold from employee wages are not withheld or are not deposited or \npaid to the United States Treasury, the trust fund recovery penalty may apply. The \npenalty is the full amount of the unpaid trust fund tax. This penalty may apply to you if \nthese unpaid taxes cannot be immediately collected from the business.  \n \nThe trust fund recovery penalty may be imposed on all persons who are determined by \nthe IRS to be responsible for collecting, accounting for, and paying these taxes, and who \nacted willfully in not doing so.  \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nOn August 23, 2007, Corporation X entered into an agreement with another \ncorporation (Corporation Y), in which Corporation Y would receive 51% of Corporation \nX, with Applicant and his wife retaining a 49% interest in Corporation X. In return, \nCorporation Y agreed to \u201ctake responsibility clearing all outstanding debt and assumes \nall future debts, provide bonding for [Corporation X].\u201d5  \n \n \nOn October 5, 2007, Corporation X entered into a servicing contract with a third \nbusiness (Company Z). On April 16, 2008, Corporation X assigned its contract with \nCompany Z to Corporation Y. In return, Corporation Y agreed to assume Corporation \nX\u2019s IRS debt, as follows: \n \n[Corporation Y] acknowledges prior agreement (to pay said debt) with \n[Corporation X] for debt due IRS of approximately $196,372.57, rent of \n[Corporation X\u2019s] equipment and tools on project, purchase of equipment, \nlist of debt listed on prior agreement, retainage due [Corporation X] on \nsaid Contract [with Company Z].6 \n \n \nApplicant stated that Corporation Y failed to honor its contractual agreements. He \nstated Corporation Y did not pay the payroll taxes due to the IRS and did not pay other \nliabilities.7  \n \n \nOn May 20, 2008, Applicant\u2019s wife, signing as the president of Corporation X, \nfiled Chapter 11 bankruptcy on behalf of Corporation X. The petition listed a secured \nclaim to a bank (Bank W) for $272,966. The total of the unsecured claims exceeded \n$1.6 million. Included in the unsecured claims were claims to the IRS for $87,890 and a \nseries of claims to Bank W totaling $95,810. There was also a $450,000 claim to \nApplicant and his wife. Corporation X also filed a suit in bankruptcy court against \nCorporation Y and its owner. The bankruptcy and the included lawsuit were dismissed \nin 2009.8 \n \n \nIn June 2010, Corporation X, Applicant, and his wife filed a lawsuit against \nCorporation Y, its owners, and other entities, alleging breach of contract. The petition \n                                                                                                                                                                                           \nA responsible person can be an officer or employee of a corporation, an accountant, or \na volunteer director/trustee. A responsible person also may include one who signs \nchecks for the corporation or otherwise has authority to cause the spending of business \nfunds.  \n \nWillfully means voluntarily, consciously, and intentionally. A responsible person acts \nwillfully if the person knows the required actions are not taking place.

The petition also alleges: \n \nDefendants also: (1) interfered with Plaintiffs\u2019 contracts and business \nrelations with third parties; (2) stole, misdirected and/or misappropriated \nmoney properly owing to Plaintiffs; and (3) stole and/or otherwise obtained \nunlawful possession of Plaintiffs\u2019 tools, equipment, vehicles and other \nproperty.9 \n \n \nThe lawsuit is still pending. The defendants have filed a countersuit against \nCorporation X, Applicant, and his wife. Applicant submitted a copy of his petition; he did \nnot submit a copy of the answer or the countersuit petition.10  \n \n \nBank W filed a lawsuit against Corporation X, Applicant, and his wife. The parties \nentered into an agreed judgment in November 2010. Corporation X and Applicant\u2019s \nwife, jointly and severally, were ordered to pay $282,526 to Bank W, with interest \naccruing at the rate of 5% a year. Corporation X and Applicant\u2019s wife, jointly and \nseverally, were also ordered to pay $4,584 to Bank W, with interest accruing at the rate \nof 18% a year, plus $20,000 in attorney\u2019s fees. The case against Applicant was \ndismissed with prejudice. Applicant\u2019s attorney stated that in exchange for the agreed \njudgment, Bank W agreed not to pursue efforts to collect on the judgment until the \nlawsuit against Corporation Y is resolved.11 \n \n \nThe SOR alleges the Chapter 11 bankruptcy, five delinquent debts to Bank W, a \ndepartment store credit card account, two delinquent medical debts, a telephone \ncompany account, $87,890 owed to the IRS, and a past-due mortgage that is in \nforeclosure. The debts were listed on Applicant\u2019s credit reports. In his response to the \nSOR, Applicant denied owing all the debts except the tax debt and the mortgage, which \nhe admitted with explanations. \n \n \nThe debts to Bank W were alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d ($1,670), 1.e ($1,383), 1.f \n($27,021), 1.h ($6,859), and 1.l ($991). Applicant stated that some or all of the debts \nwere Corporation X\u2019s debts that should have been paid by Corporation Y. He admitted \nthat he was also liable to the bank because he personally guaranteed the accounts. \nWhen Corporation X filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy, it listed six unsecured accounts with \nBank W totaling $95,810. The debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.f were listed in the \npetition. Applicant is only listed on his credit report as an authorized user on the SOR \u00b6 \n1.e debt, so he is not personally liable for that debt. The bankruptcy petition does not \nappear to include the Bank W debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.h, and 1.l.12 \n \n                                                          \n9 AE A(4). \n \n10 Tr. at 39-40, 82-84; GE 11; AE A. \n \n11 Tr. at 44-48; AE A(5), B. \n \n12 Tr. at 40-48, 64-68; GE 4, 6-12; AE A. \n\n \n5 \n \n \nThe Bank W debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d is listed on Applicant\u2019s credit reports as a \njoint account. The Bank W debt in SOR \u00b6 1.l is listed on the credit reports as an \nindividual account. Applicant stated that those two debts were Corporation X accounts, \nbut he submitted no supporting documentation. He stated that the files from Corporation \nX were turned over to Corporation Y. He stated that his bankruptcy attorney has copies \nof the files from Corporation X, but the attorney has not turned them over to Applicant or \nhis present attorney.13 \n \n \nThe $6,859 Bank W debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h was transferred to a collection \ncompany. It appears to be an individual debt that was charged off, with a date of last \naction in February 2007. Applicant stated that he believed this debt was his son\u2019s \nresponsibility. The debt was reported by TransUnion on the credit reports obtained in \nNovember 2008 and May 2010. It was listed on the January 2011 Equifax credit report \nunder Bank W as a charged-off account that was transferred or sold. It was not \nseparately reported by Equifax under the collection company that received the debt. \nApplicant did not submit any documentation corroborating his statement that the debt \nbelonged to his son.14 \n \n \nApplicant denied responsibility for the $1,694 delinquent department store debt \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g. The debt is listed on the November 2008 credit report as a joint \naccount that was opened in 1984, with a date of last action in November 2004. \nApplicant stated this was his wife\u2019s debt from before they married. It is listed on later \nreports as charged off and transferred, with a zero balance. There is no indication on \nApplicant\u2019s credit reports of a subsequent collection company handling the debt.15  \n \n \nApplicant acknowledged responsibility for the medical debts of $434 and $28, as \nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c. The credit reports indicate these debts became \ndelinquent in 2008. Applicant was asked about the debts during his background \ninterview in December 2008. He did not recognize the $28 debt. He stated that his \ninsurance company paid the $434 debt. He was asked about the debts again in June \n2010. He stated that he would pay his medical debts \u201cwithin the next year or so.\u201d He \ntestified that he was unable to pay the debts because of the financial problems resulting \nfrom Corporation Y\u2019s failure to honor the contract. He obtained a job with a defense \ncontractor in October 2008, but he was placed on unpaid leave in February 2011, when \nhe lost his interim security clearance. The company is still sponsoring him and will rehire \nhim should he obtain a security clearance. Applicant stated that he will pay his medical \ndebts when he is rehired.16 \n \n \nApplicant denied responsibility for the $322 delinquent debt to a telephone \ncompany, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.k. Applicant stated that be believed the debt resulted \n                                                          \n13 Tr. at 40-48, 64-72, 81-82; GE 4, 6-12; AE A. \n \n14 Tr. at 72-78; GE 4, 6-12; AE A. \n \n15 Tr. at 48-53, 101-102; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 4, 6-10, 12; AE A. \n \n16 Tr. at 27, 68-72; GE 1, 4, 6-12. \n \n\n \n6 \n \nfrom damage done by Corporation X to the telephone company\u2019s equipment. He stated \nthat Corporation Y should have paid the debt. The debt is listed on the most recent \ncredit report as a charged-off account that was opened in April 2001, with a date of last \naction in April 2009. Applicant did not submit any business records from Corporation X, \nor any other documentary evidence, to establish that this was Corporation X\u2019s debt.17 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mortgage is in foreclosure, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.j. Applicant\u2019s \nposition, as related through the attorney addressing that matter, is that Applicant \nmaintained homeowner\u2019s insurance as required, but the mortgage company improperly \n\u201cforce paid\u201d an additional policy, which caused an increase in the monthly mortgage \npayment. When Applicant continued with his normal payments, he fell behind. The May \n2010 credit report lists the mortgage as $4,221 past due, with a balance of $194,747. \nThe January 2011 credit report does not show a past-due amount, but it shows the \nmortgage in foreclosure, with a balance of $194,000. Applicant acknowledges that he \nhas stopped making the mortgage payments in accordance with his attorney\u2019s advice. \nHis attorney filed an affidavit on March 25, 2011, in which he stated that \u201c[i]t is \ncustomary, particularly in [his] dealings with [mortgage company\u2019s attorney] for the \nhomeowner to not pay their mortgage until the dispute is resolved. This is sometimes \nthe case because it may turn out that the mortgage company may actually owe the \nhomeowner money.\u201d The attorney also wrote in that affidavit that he was working with \nthe mortgage company\u2019s attorney, and they were \u201cfairly close to having the dispute \nresolved in a mutually acceptable manner.\u201d 18  \n \n \nApplicant admitted that he is liable to the IRS for Corporation X\u2019s payroll taxes, \nas alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.i. He stated that they owed the IRS in the area of $150,000 when \nthe company was sold. He stated that the money was from the previous quarter, and \nthat the taxes \u201c[were] current, but it was coming up to the point that [they] needed to be \npaid.\u201d He stated they would have been due at the end of the quarter. Applicant\u2019s \nstatement is inconsistent with the IRS rules that payroll taxes must be paid semiweekly \nor monthly. The IRS also requires that once $100,000 is withheld from employees\u2019 \nsalaries, the taxes must be paid the next day, notwithstanding the company\u2019s normal \npayment schedule.19 Applicant later testified that the payroll taxes stopped being paid \nafter the sale to Corporation Y. He stated that he believed the amount currently owed is \nabout $150,000. Applicant stated that he had documents from the IRS computing \nspecifically how they calculated the tax liability and the current balance. He did not \nsubmit any of those documents. The IRS has placed a lien on his house. He stated that \nIRS will be paid when the lawsuit is won or settled. He stated that he will make payment \narrangements with the IRS if his lawsuit is unsuccessful.20 \n \n                                                          \n17 Tr. at 55, 93-96; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 12; AE A. \n \n18 Tr. at 53-54, 78-80; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 10, 12; AE B. \n \n19 See  IRS Publication 15 (January 2007), Employers Tax Guide at pages 18-23. www.irs.gov/pub/irs-\nprior/p15--2007.pdf. \n \n20 Tr. at 30-37, 61-62, 102-104; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 11. \n\n \n7 \n \n \nApplicant was arrested in February 2007 and charged with driving while \nintoxicated (DWI) and open alcohol container. In February 2008, he was found guilty \nand sentenced to 90 days in jail, which was suspended, probation for 18 months, a \n$1,500 fine, and court costs. Applicant acknowledged his conduct was wrong and \nstupid. He has not been arrested or charged with any offense since the DWI arrest.21  \n \n \nApplicant submitted a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) in \nOctober 2008. Under the question asking about alcohol-related charges, he listed his \nDWI conviction. He answered all the pertinent financial questions in the negative. \nApplicant credibly testified that he did not intentionally falsify the SF 86. He stated that \nhe did not have to list the bankruptcy because it was a corporate bankruptcy and not his \npersonal bankruptcy. He did not list any delinquent debts because they were corporate \ndebts, they were not delinquent when he submitted the SF 86, or he was unaware of the \ndebts.22 After considering all the evidence, I find that Applicant did not intentionally \nfalsify his SF 86.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \n                                                          \n21 Tr. at 56-57, 99-100; GE 1, 3; AE A. \n \n22 Tr. at 27-28, 55-57, 97-99; GE 1; AE A, A(6). \n \n\n \n8 \n \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant accumulated a number of delinquent debts and was unable to pay his \nfinancial obligations. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying \nconditions. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges that Applicant filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2008, and the \nbankruptcy was dismissed in 2009. That bankruptcy was filed by Corporation X, not by \nApplicant in a personal capacity. It raises no independent security concerns beyond \nthose raised in other allegations. SOR \u00b6 1.a is concluded for Applicant. \n\n \n9 \n \n \nApplicant is only listed as an authorized user on the SOR \u00b6 1.e debt, so he is not \npersonally liable for that debt. SOR \u00b6 1.e is concluded for Applicant. \n \nConditions that could mitigate financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to Corporation Y\u2019s breach of contract \nand failure to pay Corporation X\u2019s debts, including payroll taxes owed to the IRS and \ncorporate accounts owed to Bank W. However, the record is replete with concerns and \nunanswered questions.  \n \n \nApplicant stated the payroll taxes are paid quarterly, and they were not yet due \nwhen he and his wife sold 51% of their company to Corporation Y. That is contrary to \nthe IRS requirement that payroll taxes be paid semiweekly or monthly, and that once \n$100,000 is withheld from employees\u2019 salaries, the taxes must be paid the next day, \nnotwithstanding the company\u2019s normal payment schedule. Applicant did not adequately \nexplain why he and his wife did not pay Corporation X\u2019s payroll taxes when due, instead \nof relying on Corporation Y to do so. He stated that he had documents from the IRS \ncomputing specifically how they calculated the tax liability and the current balance. \nThose documents would have been helpful in evaluating this case, but Applicant did not \nsubmit any of those documents. \n \n \nApplicant stated that all or most of his Bank W accounts were corporate \naccounts. Applicant admitted that creditors would not contract with the corporation \nunless Applicant, his wife, or both of them, also agreed to be on the account in an \n\n \n10 \n \nindividual capacity. Corporation X\u2019s bankruptcy petition listed the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e \nand 1.f, so I accept those debts were tied to the corporation. He did not submit any \nbusiness records or other documentation establishing that the three other Bank W debts \nwere in any way tied to the corporation. \n \n \nBank W sued Corporation X, Applicant, and his wife. The parties entered into an \nagreed judgment in November 2010. Corporation X and Applicant\u2019s wife, jointly and \nseverally, were ordered to pay Bank W $282,526 and $4,584, plus $20,000 in attorney\u2019s \nfees. The case against Applicant was dismissed with prejudice. Applicant did not submit \nany evidence establishing which Bank W debts were involved in the lawsuit. I note that \nCorporation X\u2019s petition listed a secured claim to Bank W for $272,966 and unsecured \nclaims to Bank W totaling $95,810. I will accept that the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f was included \nin the lawsuit, and Applicant is no longer personally liable for that debt. I am unable to \ndo so for the remaining Bank W debts. I find that the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f has been \nresolved, and AG \u00b6 20(c) is applicable to that debt.  \n \n \nApplicant stated that he believed the $6,859 Bank W/collection company debt \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h was his son\u2019s responsibility. He did not submit any supporting \ndocumentation. \n \n \nApplicant stated that be believed the $322 delinquent debt to a telephone \ncompany, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.k, resulted from damage done by Corporation X to the \ntelephone company\u2019s equipment. He stated that Corporation Y should have paid the \ndebt. He did not submit any business records from Corporation X, or any other \ndocumentary evidence, to establish that this debt was Corporation X\u2019s responsibility. \n \n \nApplicant admitted that he has not been paying his mortgage. It is unclear how \nmany payments, if any, he has made in the last year. He may have a legitimate dispute \nwith the mortgage company, and his attorney indicated that it is normal procedure to not \npay the mortgage until the dispute is resolved. However, the lawyer also indicated in \nMarch 2011 that they were \u201cfairly close to having the dispute resolved in a mutually \nacceptable manner.\u201d In the meantime, Applicant is not making any mortgage payments, \nand his home apparently is in foreclosure. \n \n \nApplicant has known about the two medical debts since at least December 2008. \nHe has taken no action to pay or dispute those debts. \n \n \nApplicant stated that the $1,694 delinquent department store debt alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 1.g was his wife\u2019s debt from before they married. It is listed on the credit reports \nas a joint account that was opened in 1984, which was six years before Applicant \nmarried his wife. The debt is listed on the most recent credit reports as charged off and \ntransferred, with a zero balance. There is no indication on Applicant\u2019s credit reports of a \nsubsequent collection company handling the debt. I find that AG \u00b6 20(e) is applicable to \nthis debt. It is not applicable to any other debts.  \n \n \nIn summary, Applicant has taken no real action to pay any of his debts. He may \nhave a legitimate and winning lawsuit against Corporation Y, or he may not. Applicant \n\n \n11 \n \ndid not submit sufficient information to convince me that his financial issues will be \nresolved within a reasonable time. I find that Applicant\u2019s finances are not yet under \ncontrol. His financial issues are recent and ongoing. I am unable to determine that they \nare unlikely to recur. They continue to cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and 20(d) are not applicable. AG \u00b6 \n20(b) is partially applicable. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(e) are not applicable, except as \ndiscussed above. I find that financial concerns remain despite the presence of some \nmitigation. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \n \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \n \nApplicant did not deliberately falsify his SF 86. AG \u00b6 16(a) is not applicable. SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b are concluded for Applicant. \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct  \n \nThe security concern for criminal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about an Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses; and \n \n(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the \nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted.  \n\n \n12 \n \nApplicant\u2019s DWI conviction is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying \nconditions.  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 3.a cross alleges the falsification of the Applicant\u2019s SF 86 as a criminal \nviolation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001. Applicant did not intentionally falsify the SF 86, and he did \nnot violate 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001. SOR \u00b6 3.a is concluded for Applicant. \n \nConditions that could mitigate criminal conduct security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 32. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or \nconstructive community involvement. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s DWI arrest occurred in February 2007, more than four years ago. He \nis appropriately remorseful for the conduct, and he has not been arrested or charged for \nan offense since that date. I find there is evidence of successful rehabilitation, and \nApplicant\u2019s criminal behavior is unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and (d) are applicable.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.     \n    \n\n \n13 \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines F, E, and J in my whole-person analysis.  \n \nApplicant may win or settle his lawsuit and pay all his delinquent debts. That \ncould be years down the road, or it could never happen. Applicant has left me with \nunanswered questions and unresolved concerns about his finances. Under AG \u00b6 2(b), I \nam required to resolve my doubt in favor of national security. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nrebutted personal conduct security concerns, and he mitigated criminal conduct \nconcerns, but he has not mitigated financial considerations security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b-1.d: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.e-1.g: \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.h-1.l: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline J:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 3.a-3.b: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nEdward W. Loughran \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Applicant answered the SOR 17 November 2009, and requested\n1\na hearing. DOHA assigned the case to me 4 January 2010, and I convened a hearing 8\nMarch 2010.  DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) 16 March 2010.\n2\nApril 28, 2010\n\nThe SOR also alleged two debts totaling just over $500, which Applicant has paid. They lack security\n3\nsignificance in the context of this case.\n2\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations.  He is a 59-year-old program manager\n3\nemployed by a defense contractor since July 1999. He seeks to retain the clearance\nheld when he was in the military, and which was most recently renewed in September\n2003.\nThe SOR alleges, Applicant admits, and government exhibits substantiate, over\n$54,000 in taxes, interest, and penalties owed to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for\ntax years 1998-2008. Despite Applicant\u2019s sporadic payments to the IRS over the years,\nthe debt has grown to nearly $56,000 as of February 2010. Applicant has not entered\ninto a repayment plan with the IRS, and has no plan for addressing this indebtedness.\nThe IRS offered him a repayment plan in July 2009 in which the IRS concluded that\nApplicant could afford monthly payments of $1,690. Applicant believed he could not\nafford that payment. The IRS bases its calculations on Applicant\u2019s available income,\nwhich includes amounts Applicant is currently sending to his 401k retirement plan, his\nson\u2019s college tuition, and his tithe to his church. Applicant had proposed that the IRS\naccept monthly payments of $350. Applicant discussed a repayment plan with the IRS\nin February 2010, but they are still far apart on the monthly payment. The IRS wants\nApplicant to pay $1,621 per month; he has offered $900 (Tr. 34).\nIn September 1997, Applicant retired as an O-6 after 25 years service with the\nmilitary. In early 1996 or 1997, he and his wife separated, and ultimately divorced.\nAlthough Applicant had the property settlement reviewed by a military legal assistance\nattorney, he was unrepresented in the property settlement negotiations, and perceiving\nhis wife to be \u201cunstable\u201d largely acquiesced to her and her attorney\u2019s demands. Chief\namong those demands were Applicant\u2019s assumption of most of the marital debt,\npayment of alimony and child support, and his agreement that she could claim the\nchildren as dependents on her income tax returns. Applicant agreed to these terms\ndespite the fact that his wife did not, and does not, work outside the home.\nBecause of the property settlement, Applicant experienced financial difficulties.\nHe got custody of his children in 2000, which helped him on his income taxes, but\nrequired him to spend more on housing. In 2003, he entered a debt consolidation\nprogram and paid $700 per month for five years, finishing in November 2008. He has\nmade sporadic payments to the IRS over the years, but has not satisfied his tax liability\nfor any one year. It appears that the only tax year for which his balance has been\nreduced by payment is tax year 2008. All other tax years have increased balances\nbecause of interest and penalties.\nApplicant\u2019s combined salary and military retirement total about $182,000 per year\n(Tr. 50-51). He always files his federal income tax returns on time, but has been unable\nto pay the full amount due. The large tax liabilities in 1998 and 1998 were mostly due to\n\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n4\n3\nthe tax consequences of his separation and losing his children as deductions. He has\nnot offered satisfactory explanations for his failure to withhold adequate income tax from\n2000 to 2008, although in the later years he was subject to alternative minimum tax. He\nalso took premature distributions from his 401k retirement plan to pay debts, which\nincreased his tax liability for the year in which he made the withdrawal. He believes that\nhe has adjusted his withholding enough so he will have a small refund due when he files\nhis 2009 income tax return.\nApplicant\u2019s supervisor since 2008 considers him a trustworthy employee and\nrecommends him for his clearance. She is aware that his clearance is under review, but\nis not aware of the issues raised in the SOR.\nPolicies\nThe adjudicative guidelines (AG) list factors to be considered in evaluating an\napplicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information. Administrative judges must\nassess both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each issue fairly raised by the\nfacts and circumstances presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial\ncommonsense consideration of the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a). The presence or absence\nof a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or against applicant.\nHowever, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed where a case can be\nmeasured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial\nof access to classified information. Considering the SOR allegations and the evidence\nas a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative guideline is Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations).\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The government\nmust prove, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted\nfacts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it establishes a legally sufficient case against\naccess to classified information. Applicant must then refute, extenuate, or mitigate the\ngovernment\u2019s case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the applicant\nbears a heavy burden of persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgement,\nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own.\nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any\nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.4\n\n\u00b619 (a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;\n5\n\u00b620 (a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that\n6\nit is unlikely to recur . . . \n\u00b620 (b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control . . . and\n7\nthe individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n\u00b620 (c)  the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications\n8\nthat the problem is being resolved or is under control;\n,\u00b620(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\n9\n4\nAnalysis\nThe government established a case for disqualification under Guideline F, and\nApplicant did not mitigate the security concerns. Applicant has a history of financial\ndifficulties dating to at least 1998 as demonstrated by outstanding income tax liabilities\nfor tax years 1998 through 2008.  He has not made systematic payments to the IRS,\n5\nhas not reached a repayment agreement with the IRS, and has only recently adjusted\nhis income tax withholding for tax year 2009 to ensure that enough tax is withheld. \nThe mitigating factors for financial considerations provide little help to Applicant.\nHis financial difficulties are both recent and multiple.  His financial problems are as\n6\nmuch a product of choices he made when he separated from his wife in 1996 or 1997\nas the divorce itself.  Further, he did not deal responsibly with his tax debt. Indeed, his\n7\nfinancial plan seems to have provided for repayment of every creditor but the IRS. His\npayments to the IRS have been haphazard and sporadic. He has declined the\nrepayment plans offered by the IRS because, in his view, he cannot afford the\npayments because of other financial choices he has made. There is no evidence that\nApplicant has undertaken financial counseling. He has not demonstrated that the\nproblem has been brought substantially under control.  The payments that have been\n8\npaid have not been paid in a timely, good-faith effort.  The record does not indicate\n9\nwhen, if ever, his financial situation will be settled enough for him to make clear\nprogress on his tax debt. I conclude Guideline F against Applicant.\nA whole-person analysis requires no different result. Although the record is silent\non his military record, I take as a given that his performance was satisfactory, and there\nis no evidence of any security issues during his career. Similarly, his work performance\nis favorable. However, for the last 11 years, Applicant has demonstrated misplaced\npriorities by not addressing his income tax issues in a timely and effective manner. Even\nnow, it is not certain that Applicant will have no tax issues for tax years 2009 and\nbeyond. Further, it remains to be seen what steps Applicant will take to address his\nincome tax liabilities for tax years 1998-2008. Finally, it is anomalous that Applicant\nwould expect to be trusted with access to classified information by the same\ngovernment whose tax assessments remain unsatisfied, and growing, for more than 10\nyears.\n\n5\nFormal Findings\nParagraph 1.

The government\nmust prove, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted\nfacts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it establishes a prima facie case against access\nto classified information. Applicant must then refute, extenuate, or mitigate the\ngovernment\u2019s case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the Applicant\nbears a heavy burden of persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement,\nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own.\nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any\nreasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.2\nAnalysis\nThe government established a case for disqualification under Guideline H, by\ndemonstrating Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana and other drugs between November 2002\nand March 2009.  However, Applicant has only partially mitigated the security concerns.\n3\nRegarding his experimental use of prescription painkillers, adderall, and hallucinogenic\nmushrooms, he demonstrated that the use was under circumstances unlikely to recur,4\nand further demonstrated intent to not abuse these drugs in the future.  While\n5\nApplicant\u2019s use of these drugs is fairly characterized as \u201crecent,\u201d this term has less\nmeaning under the new adjudicative criteria, where the corresponding language \u201cthe\nbehavior happened so long ago. . .\u201d [\u00b6 26.(a)], is used in the disjunctive with language\nthat clearly applies to Applicant. In addition, his experimental drug abuse was\ninfrequent. Nevertheless, Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns raised by this\ndrug abuse. Notwithstanding that college may be a more relaxed environment than the\nworkplace, Applicant\u2019s abuse of these drugs began when he was a second-semester\nsenior, at a time when he should have begun thinking of his life after college. Yet, he\ntried mushrooms and non-standard uses of prescription medication, and let his friends\ntry those non-standard uses as well. Even after leaving college, and having made the\n\n4\ndecision to cease marijuana use, he used mushrooms again in September 2008, after\nbeing hired by his employer, if not after completing his clearance application and\nsecurity briefing. Finally, after his security briefing, and with full knowledge of the\nimplications for his clearance, he abused adderall in March 2009.\nApplicant also failed to mitigate the security concerns over his marijuana use.\nThat use was regular, if not frequent. Like his experimental use of other drugs,\nApplicant\u2019s use of marijuana was recent. Unlike that use, his marijuana use was not\ninfrequent overall, and not under unusual circumstances. Further, his continued\nresidence with marijuana users raises concern. He has not dissociated himself from\ndrug using associates and contacts, changed or avoided environments where drugs are\nused, or had an appropriate period of abstinence. He has executed no signed statement\nof intent to refrain from marijuana use. The fact that he lives with three female\nhousemates who do not use marijuana does not mitigate the fact that he lives with two\nother male housemates who do. Without some corroboration of either his abstention or\nhis refusal of offered marijuana, I do not consider his year-plus abstinence from\nmarijuana use an appropriate period of abstinence. Accordingly, I resolve Guideline H\nagainst Applicant\nAdditionally, this conclusion is completely consistent with a whole person\nanalysis. Although the quality of his work, his handling of proprietary information, and\nhis recognition that the workplace is a different environment from college\u2014with different\nexpectations and responsibilities\u2014support his eligibility for access to classified\ninformation, these factors do not overcome the negative inferences of his marijuana use\nand experimental abuse of drugs after entering the workforce.\nFormal Findings\nParagraph 1.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On June 30, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On February 17, 2010, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Erin C. Hogan\ndenied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6\nE3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s findings of fact were\nbased upon substantial record evidence; whether Applicant was denied due process; and whether the\n\nThe Board notes that the creditor\u2019s choice to charge off a debt for accounting purposes does not affect the\n1\ndebtor\u2019s obligations to the creditor.  For additional detail, see a U.S. Department of Treasury-administered website:\nhttp://www.helpwithmybank.gov/faqs/loan_general.html.\nJudge\u2019s adverse security clearance decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Finding\nno error, we affirm.\nThe Judge found that Applicant, a computer operator employed by a Defense contractor, had\nsignificant delinquent debt for unpaid federal income tax liens and for credit card accounts.  The\nthree tax liens total nearly $44,000 while the credit card debts total over $59,000.  Applicant\nexplained that he got behind in his taxes due to his having to pay what he viewed as unreasonably\nlarge amounts of child support.  He also attributed his financial condition to health problems which\nhe had suffered.  Applicant plans to file for bankruptcy protection.  \nIn the Analysis portion of the decision, the Judge concluded that Applicant\u2019s evidence did\nnot mitigate his failure to pay his income taxes or his large credit card debt, noting that he has not\nhad to pay child support for seven years.  Although she acknowledged that Applicant intends to file\nfor bankruptcy, she stated that it was premature to conclude that his debts would actually be\ndischarged.  The Judge concluded that Applicant had failed to meet his burden of persuasion under\nthe standard set forth in Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cThe general\nstandard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the\nnational security\u2019\u201d).\nApplicant challenges some of the Judge\u2019s findings of fact.  For example, he contends that she\nerred in stating that his debts are unresolved, in light of evidence that some of the credit card debts\nhad been charged off. A delinquent debt is not mitigated because the creditor has charged off the\naccount.   However, the record as a whole supports the Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant owes the\n1\ndebts which formed the basis of her adverse formal findings.  Applicant\u2019s testimony that he is\nseeking to discharge his debts in bankruptcy and seeking an accord and satisfaction with the IRS\nimplicitly acknowledges the legitimacy of his debts.  Applicant challenges a statement in the\nDecision to the effect that tax debts are not dischargeable in bankruptcy except in rare circumstances.\nHe testified that his attorney had advised him that the tax liens would be discharged, although he\nprovided no corroboration.  In any event, he has not undermined the Judge\u2019s conclusion that his tax\nliens reflect poorly on his judgment and reliability. \nApplicant also contends that his credit reports contain inaccuracies and that the Judge erred\nin stating that the IRS had garnished his wages.  On this latter point, Applicant himself testified that\nthe IRS initiated a garnishment action against him to collect past due taxes.  Tr. at 25; Government\nExhibit 2, Interrogatories, at 10.  After reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge\u2019s\nmaterial findings are based on substantial evidence, or constitute reasonable characterizations or\ninferences that could be drawn from the record.  Applicant has not identified any harmful error likely\nto change the outcome of the case.  Considering the record evidence as a whole, the Judge\u2019s material\nfindings of security concern are sustainable.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-21025 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct.\n9, 2007).\n\nApplicant asserts that prior to the hearing he requested a postponement of the hearing so that\nhe could properly prepare to argue for a grant of his clearance.  He notes that his request was denied.\nApplicant states that the denial greatly altered the outcome of the hearing.  Applicant claims that he\nsuffers from a number of physical ailments and that during the hearing he was sick, weak, and\nexhausted.  Applicant\u2019s argument does not establish error on the part of the Judge.  \nRulings of DOHA administrative judges regarding requests for continuances are reviewed\nfor an abuse of discretion.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-03683 at 4 (App. Bd. Aug. 9, 2002); ISCR\nCase No. 03-26115 at 2 (App. Bd. Apr. 5, 2007).  In this case the record reflects the following: The\ndate of the hearing was originally set in this case for October 22, 2009.  On October 20, 2009,\nApplicant submitted a written request for a postponement to the Judge, stating he needed time to\nsearch for a lawyer and requesting that the hearing be held no sooner than November 19, 2009.  The\nJudge granted this request the same day, and a new hearing date of December 2, 2009 was set.  On\nNovember 20, 2009 Applicant wrote to the Judge and indicated that December 2, 2009 was not a\n\u201cworkable date\u201d in that the attorney he was considering hiring was not available on that date.\nApplicant indicated he wanted to postpone the hearing until sometime in January 2010.  On\nNovember 24, 2009, the Judge contacted Applicant and indicated that she was denying his latest\nrequest for a delay, noting that additional time had already been granted to him for the purpose of\nhiring an attorney and he had not done so.  The Judge also informed Applicant that if he did obtain\nan attorney, he should have the attorney contact the Judge if the December 2, 2009 hearing date\npresented a scheduling conflict.  Nothing else transpired before the hearing date.  At the hearing the\nJudge asked the parties if there were any procedural matters to resolve before going forward.  Neither\nparty indicated that there were any outstanding procedural matters.  The history of the prior requests\nfor continuances was not brought up on the record, and Applicant gave no indication that he was\nunable to proceed that day.  Given these facts, the Board concludes that the Judge acted reasonably\nand that there was no violation of Applicant\u2019s due process rights. \nAfter reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant data\nand articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

Applicant is a 51-year-old senior computer operator employed by a Department of Defense contractor seeking renewal of his security clearance. He has worked for his current employer since July 2009.

On June 30, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline \nF, Financial Considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn August 20, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on \nSeptember 9, 2009. The case was assigned to me on September 16, 2009. On \nSeptember 24, 2009, a Notice of Hearing was issued, scheduling the hearing for \nOctober 22, 2009. On October 20, 2009, Applicant requested additional time because \nhe intended to retain counsel. His request was granted. On October 21, 2009, an \namended Notice of Hearing was issued, scheduling the hearing for December 2, 2009. \nThe hearing was held on that date. On November 20, 2009, Applicant requested a delay \nFebruary 17, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n \nuntil January 2010 because he still had not retained counsel. The request was denied \nbecause Applicant had over a month to retain counsel. During the hearing, the \ngovernment offered five exhibits which were admitted as Government Exhibits (Gov) 1 \u2013 \n5. Applicant testified and offered four exhibits which were marked as Applicant Exhibits \nA \u2013 D without objection. The record was held open until January 4, 2010, to allow \nApplicant to submit additional documents. He timely submitted a 29-page document that \nwas admitted as AE E. Department Counsel\u2019s response to AE E is marked as HE I. The \ntranscript (Tr) was received on December 9, 2010.  Based upon a review of the case \nfile, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant denies all of the SOR allegations. \n \n \nApplicant is a 51-year-old senior computer operator employed by a Department \nof Defense contractor seeking renewal of his security clearance. He has worked for his \ncurrent employer since July 2009.  He has worked at the same location for various \ndifferent contractors for more than 22 years. He has held a SECRET security clearance \nsince 1987 with no security violations. He has two years of college credit. He is single \nand has a 27-year-old daughter. (Tr at 6-8, 34; Gov 1.)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s security clearance background investigation revealed that he has the \nfollowing delinquent accounts: a $15,147 federal tax lien entered in March 2007 (SOR \u00b6 \n1.a: Gov 4 at 1; Gov 5 at 4); a $2,712 federal tax lien entered in February 1996 (SOR \u00b6 \n1.b: Gov 4 at 1; Gov 5 at 4); a $26,140 federal tax lien entered in October 1994 (SOR \u00b6 \n1.c: Gov 4 at 1; Gov 5 at 4); a $6,247 department store credit card account that was \ncharged off in July 2008 (SOR \u00b6 1.d: Gov 4 at 2; Gov 5 at 7); a $30,823 credit card \naccount that was charged off in February 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.e: Gov 3 at 3; Gov 4 at 2; Gov \n5 at 6); a $9,204 credit card account charged off in April 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.f: Gov 4 at 2;  \nGov 5 at 6); and a $12,581 credit account charged off in June 2008 (SOR \u00b6 1.g: Gov 4 \nat 2; Gov 5 at 5). \n \nAdditional delinquent accounts include: a $103 telephone account that was \ncharged off in January 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.h: Gov 4 at 2; Gov 5 at 8); a $480 electric utility \naccount that was delinquent as of May 11, 2009 (SOR \u00b6 1.i: Gov 3 at 4); $100 hospital \nbill that was delinquent as of May 11, 2009 (SOR \u00b6 1.j: Gov 3 at 4); a $81 gas biil that \nwas delinquent as of May 11, 2009 (SOR \u00b6 1.k: Gov 3 at 4); a $200 doctor bill that was \ndelinquent as of May 11, 2009 (SOR \u00b6 1.l: Gov 3 at 4); and a $387.44 monthly car loan \npayment that was delinquent as of May 11, 2009 (SOR \u00b6 1.m: Gov 3 at 4). \n \nIn his response to the SOR, dated August 20, 2009, Applicant blames his \nfinancial problems on \u201csinisterly unfair\u201d child support payments, poor health, and the \nInternal Revenue Service\u2019s (IRS) garnishment of his wages at an inopportune time.  \nApplicant claims that between 1993 to 2003, between 45% to 48% of his take-home pay \nwent towards child support payments (i.e. $1,000 per month).  In addition, he served as \n\n \n3 \n \n \nhis mother\u2019s primary caretaker for 12 years before she passed away in 2006.  In 2007, \nthe IRS garnished his paycheck. Applicant\u2019s wages were garnished $1,900 a month \nover a six-month period. Applicant claims that he was then unable to pay other \nexpenses. His health suffered and he could not work. (Tr at 18-26, 39; AE A; AE B; \nResponse to SOR) \n \nApplicant claims he did not pay his federal tax debts because he had no money \nto pay the tax debts. He denied that he owed the three federal tax liens alleged in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.c because the IRS considers them uncollectable. The tax liens related to \nyears that Applicant owed income taxes, some in the 1980s and 1990s. During the \nhearing, he admitted that he has not paid federal taxes owed for tax years 2008 and \n2009. He intends to submit an offer in compromise to resolve the tax debts. He does not \nremember the last time he made a payment towards his federal tax debt other than \ngarnishment. (Tr at 31, 36, 44-45; Response to SOR) \n \nApplicant admits that the credit card debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.e, 1.f, and \n1.g are his credit card accounts. He disputes the balances because of the excessive \ninterest charges and fees.  He indicates that the accounts are charged off and claims no \ncollection agency has contacted him about collecting the debt. He recently sent a \nsettlement offer to each credit card company but has not received a response. He \nconsulted a bankruptcy attorney in October 2009, and intends to file for bankruptcy in \nthe spring of 2010. (Tr at 30-32, 51-52; 57, 66-68; Gov 3; AE C; Response to SOR) \n \nIn response to interrogatories dated May 11, 2009, Applicant listed the following \naccounts as delinquent: an electric company utility account, hospital account, gas \ncompany account, dental bill, and a car loan. He testified that all of the accounts are \ncurrent  and provided proof after the hearing that the following accounts were current: \nelectric company utility account (SOR \u00b6 1.i: AE E at 24), hospital account (SOR \u00b6 1.j: \nAE E at 20-21); gas company account (SOR \u00b6 1.k: AE E at 25); dental bill (SOR \u00b6 1.l: \nAE at 26), and a car loan (SOR \u00b6 1.m: AE E at 22-23). SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i \u2013 1.m are found for \nApplicant.  \n \nApplicant provided proof that he resolved the charged off telephone account that \nwas alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h. (AE E at 27-29) SOR \u00b6 1.h is found for Applicant.     \n \nApplicant has been continuously employed since 1987. He currently earns \n$54,000 annually. His net monthly income is approximately $3,000. His rent is $760. \nOther monthly expenses include groceries $400; clothes $50; utilities $160; car \nexpenses $850 (includes loan payment, insurance and repairs); medical expenses $250 \nand miscellaneous $120. Based on these figures, his total monthly expenses are $2,590 \nwhich leaves him $410 a month in discretionary income.  His car loan will be paid this \nspring. (Tr at  42-43, 70-73; see Gov 3 at 5) He has approximately $16,000 saved in  \nindividual retirement accounts. He owns no property or other assets. (Tr at 77-78) \n \nApplicant recently sought the advice of several lawyers and individuals well \nversed in financial matters. They told him that he had no chance of paying back this \n\n \n4 \n \n \nmoney and recommended bankruptcy. (Tr at 30) He attended financial counseling \nclasses through his church but has not attended in several years. (Tr at 79-80)   \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which must be considered \nwhen determining an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n\n \n5 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. I find Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) &19(a) (an \ninability or unwillingness to satisfy debts); and FC DC &19(c), (a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations) apply here. Applicant has had financial difficulties for several \nyears. The SOR alleged 13 delinquent accounts, an approximate total balance of \n$104,475. Of that amount, $43,999 is for unresolved federal income tax debts, and \n$59,125 is for charged off credit card accounts. \n \nThe government\u2019s substantial evidence and Applicant\u2019s own admissions raise \nsecurity concerns under Guideline F. The burden shifted to Applicant to produce \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. (Directive \n\u00b6E3.1.15) An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden \nof disproving it never shifts to the government. (See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. September 22, 2005))  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition \n(FC MC) \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) is not applicable. \nApplicant has had financial problems for several years. While Applicant\u2019s accounts \nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h through 1.m are resolved, the federal income tax issue remains \nunresolved as well as the $59,125 in charged off credit card accounts. While Applicant \nintends to file bankruptcy, he has not filed yet. His federal income tax debts will more \nthan likely not be discharged in bankruptcy. Applicant\u2019s past financial history and \nunresolved debts raise questions about his reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment.  \n \n \nFC MC & 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual \n\n \n6 \n \n \nacted responsibly under the circumstances) partially applies. Applicant served as his \nmother\u2019s caregiver for 12 years until she passed away in 2006. His health issues further \ncomplicated his financial situation. However, I cannot conclude he has acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances given the amount of his indebtedness. He \nattributes much of his financial problems to excessive child support payments, but he \nhas not been required to pay child support for more than seven years. A simple change \nof his exemptions on his W-2 form could have lessened the amount of taxes he owed at \nthe end of each tax year. The amount of his credit card debt indicates an individual who \nhas acted irresponsibly. While there are mitigating conditions in Applicant\u2019s case, they \ndo not explain why he has been unable to pay his federal tax debt and do not explain \nthe excessive charges that Applicant made on his credit card accounts.  \n \nFC MC \u00b6 20(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol) does not apply. While Applicant attended financial counseling through his \nchurch a few years ago, he did not follow through with the class. He is in the process of \nfiling for bankruptcy, which may result in the bankruptcy court discharging the $59,125 \ncharged off credit card accounts, but the bankruptcy court is unlikely to discharge the \n$43,000 in unresolved federal income tax debts because tax debts are not \ndischargeable debts in bankruptcy except in rare circumstances. His tax debt is likely \nhigher because Applicant admits he owes federal income taxes for tax years 2008 and \n2009. Applicant\u2019s financial problems are unlikely to be resolved in the near future.  \n \nFC MC & 20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts) applies with respect to the debts alleged in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.h \u2013 1.m. He is in the early stages of preparation for filing for bankruptcy, which may \nresolve the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d \u2013 1.g. However, it is premature to conclude that \nthe debts will be discharged because Applicant has not filed for bankruptcy yet. Even if \nhis debts were discharged in bankruptcy, questions remain as to whether Applicant will \nbe financially responsible in the future.   \n \nOverall, the record evidence is insufficient to conclude that Applicant has \nestablished and implemented a plan to resolve his delinquent accounts. He has not \nmitigated the concerns raised under Guideline F.  \n  \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \n\n \n7 \n \n \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \n        \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s health \nissues, his medical costs, as well as the costs of being his mother\u2019s primary caregiver \nfor 12 years before her death in 2006. I considered that from 1999 to 2003, he made  \nlarge child support payments. However, he has not been required to pay child support in \nmore than seven years. His daughter is 27 years old. It was his duty to pay his federal \nincome taxes. He has not paid his federal tax debts for years, some years going back \nthe 1980s and 1990s. While there are some mitigating circumstances in Applicant\u2019s \nfinancial situation, it does not really explain how he got to the point where he owed \n$43,999 in past-due federal income taxes and $59,125 in charged off credit card \naccounts. While Applicant is likely to file for bankruptcy in the near future, he will still \nowe the IRS a significant amount of past-due income taxes. He intends to submit an \noffer in compromise to the IRS, but had not done so at the close of the record. He did \nnot mitigate the concerns raised under financial considerations and did not meet his \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.   \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.i:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.j:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.k:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.l:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.m:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interests to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

He responded to the interrogatories on May 26, \n2009.2 On another unspecified date, DOHA furnished him another set of interrogatories, \nthis time pertaining to an unsworn declaration of an interview he had with an \ninvestigator from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) on June 3, 2008.

He responded to those interrogatories on \nDecember 2, 2009.4 On May 7, 2010, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to \nhim, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive);  and Adjudicative Guidelines \nfor Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified Information (effective within the \nDepartment of Defense on September 1, 2006) (AG) for all adjudications and other \ndeterminations made under the Directive. The SOR alleged trustworthiness concerns \nunder Guideline F (Financial Considerations), and detailed reasons why DOHA could \nnot make a preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for occupying an \nInformation Systems Position designated ADP I/II/III to support a contract with the \nDepartment of Defense, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to \ndetermine whether such eligibility should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  \n \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on June 7, 2010. In a written \nstatement, notarized on June 7, 2010, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel indicated the \nGovernment was prepared to proceed on July 6, 2010, and the case was assigned me \non October 18, 2010. A Notice of Hearing was issued on November 13, 2010, and I \nconvened the hearing, as scheduled, on December 2, 2010. \n \n \nDuring the hearing, 10 Government exhibits (1-10) were admitted into evidence, \nwithout objection. Applicant testified, but offered no exhibits. The record remained open \nto afford Applicant the opportunity to supplement it. On December 23, 2010, and on \nJanuary 7, 2011, he submitted a total of 4 documents that were marked as exhibits (A-\nD) and admitted into evidence, without objection. The transcript (Tr.) was received on \nDecember 7, 2010. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted nearly all of the factual allegations \n(\u00b61.a., and \u00b6\u00b6 1.d. through 1.h.) of the SOR.

He was a senior \nsystem administrator for a large telecommunications company from October 2000 until \nJuly 2004; a self-employed information technology (IT) consultant from July 2004 until \nFebruary 2006;9 and a ramp service agent and subsequently IT technical support for an \nairline from February 2006 until February 2008,10 before being hired by his current \nemployer in May 2008.11  \n \nHe went through two periods of underemployment or unemployment. In 2004, he \nwas laid off along with all of the employer\u2019s employees before the company eventually \nwent out of business.12 Although he attempted to make a living as a self-employed IT \nconsultant, he was essentially unemployed from July 2004 until February 2006.13 His \nsecond period of unemployment was much shorter, and lasted about one month when \nthe airline for which he was working in February 2008 entered bankruptcy and laid him \noff.14 Applicant estimated he earned less than $20,000 in 2004; not more than $30,000 \nin 2005; and less than $40,000 in 2006.15 \n \nApplicant was married in April 1989.16 They have five children, born in 1989, \n1991, 1992, 1995, and 1997, respectively.17 In February 2007, Applicant and his wife \ninformally separated, in part, due to financial stress and her involvement with another \nindividual.18 They have remained separated. \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nThere was nothing unusual about Applicant\u2019s finances until July 2004, when \nApplicant was laid off.19 When the company eventually went out of business, all \n \n \n7 Id. at 2. \n \n8 Tr. at 64. \n \n9 Id. at 65. \n \n10 Government Exhibit 1, supra note 1, at 3. \n \n11 Id. \n \n12 Personal Subject Interview, dated June 3, 2008, at 1, attached to Government Exhibit 3, supra note 3. \n \n13 Tr. at 65. \n \n14 Id. \n \n15 Id. at 27-29. \n \n16 Government Exhibit 1, supra note 1, at 5. \n \n17 Id. \n \n18 Id. \n \n19 At the time he was laid off, Applicant\u2019s bills were all current.

Reluctant to \nseek bankruptcy, his wife returned to the workforce, and Applicant borrowed $10,000 to \nsave their house from foreclosure and to help with the delinquencies, but everything \ndeteriorated.21 His wife always received correspondence from the creditors, and that \nsituation has continued to the present time.22 Immediately upon separating, Applicant \nmoved from the family residence and in with a friend. He later relocated to another state \nupon being hired by his current employer, and now resides with his mother to conserve \nmoney.23 \n  \nCommencing the first month following their separation, Applicant sent over 50% \nof his salary as a support payment to his wife.24 In August 2009, the court ordered him \nto pay her $2,549.19 in monthly child support, and $2,500.00 in monthly maintenance, \nfor a total monthly obligation of $5,049.19.25 The order was forwarded to his employer \nto garnish his wages, and $2,330.40 is withheld each pay date.26\n \nWhen Applicant and his wife separated, he made an oral arrangement with her \nregarding medical benefits for their children. He maintained those benefits, and she was \nto take care of any medical bills whenever the children need medical attention.27 \nAdditionally, upon receiving the financial interrogatories which listed his delinquent \naccounts,28 he approached her, and she indicated she was going to help and they \nwould jointly seek discharge through bankruptcy.29 Since then, she apparently reversed \ncourse, and he was advised he would have to handle the problem by himself.30 \n \nIn May 2009, Applicant claimed he was \u201cworking toward paying [his] debt.\u201d31 He \nalso prepared a personal financial statement, indicating his monthly expenses, including \n \n20 Id. at 1. \n \n21 Id. \n \n22 Id. at 2. \n \n23 Id. \n \n24 Id. \n \n25 Applicant Exhibit D (Amended Support Order, dated August 25, 2009), at 2. \n \n26 Applicant Exhibit C (Original Income Withholding Order, dated August 18, 2010), at 1, and (Interoffice \nMemo, Subject: Courtesy Notice of Wage Attachment Received, dated October 29, 2009). \n  \n27 Tr. at 33-34. \n \n28 Government Exhibit 2, supra note 2. \n \n29 Tr. at 34. \n \n30 Id. \n \n31 Government Exhibit 2, supra note 2, at 7. \n \n\n \n5 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \nsupport and maintenance, and his telephone bill, totaled $2,480.32 In December 2009, \nhe stated: \u201cMy plans are to get this completed myself. My ex was to do all of this and \nlooks like she hasn\u2019t. I will take control of this process and get the bankruptcy going. . . . \nI will take control and get this going at the first of the year.\u201d33 On December 23, 2010, \nhe prepared another personal financial statement indicating his monthly net salary as \n$2,921.02, his wife\u2019s monthly net salary as $1,610.00, for a total monthly net income of \n$4,021.00, and monthly expenses, not including any debt repayment, of $2,625.00.34 \nNo delinquent accounts were listed. It appears that he personally has a net remainder \navailable for discretionary spending, such as debt repayment, totaling $296.02. \nNevertheless, Applicant contends he barely has enough money to give to his wife for \nthe children, or \u201ckeep [his] head above water,\u201d much less attempt to pay any delinquent \nbills.35 \n \nThe SOR identified 10 purportedly continuing delinquencies as reflected by credit \nreports from 2008,36 2009,37 and 2010,38 totaling approximately $96,529. Some \naccounts listed in the credit reports have been transferred, reassigned, or sold to other \ncreditors or collection agents. Other accounts are referenced repeatedly in these credit \nreports, in many instances duplicating other accounts listed, either under the same \ncreditor name or under a different creditor name.

Positions designated as ADP I/II/III are classified as \u201csensitive \npositions.\u201d44 \u201cThe standard that must be met for . . . assignment to sensitive duties is \nthat, based on all available information, the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to sensitive duties is clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security.\u201d45 Department of Defense contractor \npersonnel are afforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any \nfinal unfavorable access determination may be made.46  \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust \nposition. \n \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines \nare applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and common \nsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. \n \n \n41 Id. at 54. \n \n42 Id. \n \n43 Department of the Navy v.

Once the Government has produced \nsubstantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \napplicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, \nextenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s \ncase. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.48  \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as \nwell. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to \nrepose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants \naccess to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information.  \nFurthermore, security clearance determinations, and by inference, public trust \ndeterminations, should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d49 In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. . . . \n \n \n47 \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to \nsupport a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, \n2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1).  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  \nSee v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \n \n48 See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \n49 Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n\n \n8 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG \u00b6 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  \nSimilarly, under AG \u00b6 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise \nsecurity concerns. As noted above, there was nothing unusual about Applicant\u2019s \nfinances until about mid-2004, when he was laid off and was underemployed or \nunemployed until February 2006 before obtaining another job with a reduced salary. As \nnoted above, Applicant estimated he earned less than $20,000 in 2004; not more than \n$30,000 in 2005; and less than $40,000 in 2006. With his marriage dissolving, his \naccounts becoming delinquent, and his income and credit deteriorating, Applicant and \nhis wife separated, and he left the family residence. Since she had always taken care of \ntheir family finances, he let her continue doing so, despite their separation. He \nessentially divorced himself from the delinquent accounts, and satisfied himself by \nsimply paying her child support and maintenance. With insufficient funds to pay the \nmonthly payments, Applicant\u2019s accounts fell deeper into delinquency, and the bank \nforeclosed on the family residence. He made no effort to contact his creditors to resolve \nhis accounts, and has not filed for bankruptcy. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition \nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Also, under AG \n\u00b6 20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where Athe conditions that resulted \nin the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of \nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce \nor separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ Evidence \nthat Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are \nclear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@ is potentially \nmitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG \u00b6 20(d) applies where the evidence shows \nAthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise \nresolve debts.@50 Also, AG \u00b6 20(e) may apply where \u201cthe individual has a reasonable \nbasis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem \nand provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.\u201d  \n \n \n50 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood-faith\u201d effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant must present \nevidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith \naction aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not define the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 \nHowever, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith \u2018requires a showing that a person \nacts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 \nAccordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally \navailable option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the \n\u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition].  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd.

The \ntwo delinquent accounts with balances of $150.00, and the delinquent account with a \n$252.00 balance have been ignored. Applicant never contacted any of the creditors to \ntry to make repayment arrangements. Over the years, Applicant did not act \naggressively, timely, or responsibly to resolve his delinquent debts. Instead, he ignored \nhis debts and continues to do so.  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply because Applicant he has not provided documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of any disputed account. \n  \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \n51 \u201cEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside his \n[or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when \ndealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case \nNo. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005); ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. \n99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999)).  \n \n\n \n10 \n                                      \n \n(a)(9). \n                                                          \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \nThere is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct. When these \nproblems commenced with his being laid off in 2004, and continued through his \nunemployment and underemployment, his finances continued to go steadily out of \ncontrol. His financial problems were exacerbated by his separation and the garnishment \nof a substantial portion of his wages. After a lengthy period of inaction during which he \ndid not address his creditors, Applicant indicated he intends to file for bankruptcy.  \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. \nWhile the unemployment and reduced earnings were circumstances beyond his control, \nApplicant either had no ability or no intention to pay his delinquent accounts. He did not \nmake any efforts to pay his creditors, generally ignoring them and relying on his wife to \nhandle everything. His long-standing failure to repay creditors, at least in reasonable \namounts, or to arrange payment plans, reflects traits which raise concerns about his \nfitness to hold a security clearance.  \n \nI am mindful that any one factor, considered in isolation, might put Applicant\u2019s \ncredit history in a sympathetic light. I have evaluated the various aspects of this case in \nlight of the totality of the record evidence and have not merely performed a piecemeal \nanalysis.52 The absence of any efforts or evidence to reflect actual payments to his \nSOR creditors are sufficient to raise continuing security concerns. See AG \u00b6 2(a)(1) \nthrough AG \u00b6 2\nThe Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in \nfinancial cases stating:53 \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201c\u2018meaningful track record\u2019 necessarily includes evidence of \nactual debt reduction through payment of debts.\u201d However, an applicant is \nnot required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off \neach and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an \napplicant demonstrate that he [or she] has \u201c . . . established a plan to \nresolve his [or her] financial problems and taken significant actions to \nimplement that plan.\u201d The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of \nan applicant\u2019s financial situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the \nextent to which that applicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of his outstanding \nindebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive \u00b6  E2.2(a) (\u201cAvailable, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d) There is \nno requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts \n \n52 See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. \nBd. Jun. 2, 2006). \n \n53 ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations omitted). \n\n \n11 \n                                      \n \nsimultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may \nprovide for the payment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no \nrequirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable \ndebt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as \nto Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a public trust position. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his financial \nconsiderations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.i:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.j:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility to occupy an \nInformation Systems Position designated ADP II to support a contract with the \nDepartment of Defense.

Applicant visited his wife in the PRC in June \nand October 2008. Applicant\u2019s step-son and mother-in-law are citizens and residents of \nthe PRC. His wife and her son have lived in the PRC since June 2008 (Items 4, 5, 6)  \n \nApplicant is a senior operations coordinator for a government contractor. He has \n20 years of U.S. Army service. He previously held a Secret security clearance in the \nArmy. He seeks a security clearance to perform his current job. (Items 4-6) \n \nAccording to an interview with a government investigator on December 11, 2008; \nconfirmed in his interrogatory answers made on May 3, 2009; and in his SOR Answer; \nApplicant gave his wife money to purchase a house in the . She lives there with her son. \nThis purchase occurred in June 2008. Applicant is not a legal owner of this property \nbecause he is not a citizen of the PRC. Applicant\u2019s wife is seeking a U.S. visa and \nwould like to reside in the United States with Applicant after his current contract expires. \nApplicant is sponsoring his wife for the visa. She intends to become a U.S. citizen when \nshe is eligible. Applicant gives his wife $4,000 monthly to support her and her son, and \n\n \n \n \n \n \n3\nhis mother-in-law. Applicant voluntarily pays for his step-son\u2019s education. He has \ntelephone contact with his wife and step-son daily. (Items 4-6) \n \nI take administrative notice of the following facts relating to the PRC. The PRC is \na one-party Communist totalitarian state. It has an economy growing at 10% annually, \nand expanding military forces, including its naval forces. It engages in industrial and \nmilitary espionage on a regular basis against the United States and other countries.  \nThe United States and the PRC have been rivals since 1948, when the Communists \ntook control of mainland China, and the Nationalist government fled to the island of \nTaiwan. Taiwan remains an issue of contention between the two countries. The U.S. - \nChina Economic and Security Review Commission=s 2006 report to the U.S. Congress \nfound the PRC has a large and aggressive intelligence gathering operation in the United \nStates, particularly in the scientific and military fields.  The PRC engages regularly in \nmilitary, economic, and industrial espionage, including stealing nuclear weapons \ntechnology, missile design information, and commercial technology. The PRC also \nobtains commercial information through the use of front companies, buying dual-use \ntechnologies, and the direct collection of technology by non-intelligence agencies and \nindividuals. The Peoples Liberation Army (PLA) is integrated into the civil industrial base \nin the PRC, known as the \u201cdigital triangle.\u201d The 2007 Report to Congress of the U.S.-\nChina Economic and Security Review Commission (Item V at Page 102) states the \nlinkages between the military and Chinese commercial information technology \ncompanies and the R&D institute are longstanding, \u201cas telecommunications and \ninformation technology in China were originally under military auspices and the \ncommercial relationships with state and military research institutes remain important.\u201d \nAdditionally, the U.S. State Department reported the PRC has a poor human rights \nrecord, including but not limited to, denial of free speech and press, fair and open trials, \nand other basic rights recognized by the international community. It also suppresses \npolitical dissent, using arbitrary arrests, forced confessions, and mistreatment of \nprisoners as part of its operational methods to maintain control of its population. The \nU.S. State Department notifies visitors to the PRC that they are expected to register \nwith the police within 24 hours of arrival in the PRC. (Items I to XV) \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant=s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant=s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, the administrative judge applies the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge=s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG & 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \n\n \n \n \n \n \n4\nknown as the Awhole-person concept.@ The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG & 2(b) \nrequires that A[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.@ In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nAccording to Directive & E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to \nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive & E3.1.15, an \n\u201capplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, \nand has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance \ndecision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be Ain terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.@ See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nAG \u00b6 6 expresses the security concern regarding foreign influence: \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \n\n \n \n \n \n \n5\nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 7 describes nine conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying, five of which may be potentially applicable in this case: \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual's desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information; \n \n(c) counterintelligence information, that may be classified, indicates that \nthe individual's access to protected information may involve unacceptable \nrisk to national security; \n \n(d) sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n \n(e) a substantial business, financial, or property interest in a foreign \ncountry, or in any foreign-owned or foreign-operated business, which \ncould subject the individual to heightened risk of foreign influence or \nexploitation; \n \n(f) failure to report, when required, association with a foreign national; \n \n(g) unauthorized association with a suspected or known agent, associate, \nor employee of a foreign intelligence service; \n \n(h) indications that representatives or nationals from a foreign country are \nacting to increase the vulnerability of the individual to possible future \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(i) conduct, especially while traveling outside the U.S., which may make \nthe individual vulnerable to exploitation, pressure, or coercion by a foreign \nperson, group, government, or country. \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n6\n \nApplicant has ties of marriage, affection, and financial investment in the PRC, \nwhich raise a heightened security risk. He has daily contact with his wife and her son. \nThey are citizens and residents of the PRC. The ties of affection and loyalty to his wife \nmake Applicant subject to a risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, \npressure, or coercion by agents of the PRC. AG \u00b6 7 (a) applies.  \n \n \nThese same familial connections to his wife and her son create a potential for a \nconflict of interest between Applicant\u2019s obligations to protect U.S. classified information \nand his desire to continue to help his wife financially and emotionally. Applicant gives \nher $4,000 monthly to support her. He gave her money to buy a house in the PRC.  AG \n\u00b6 7 (b) applies. \n \n \nApplicant lives with his wife when he visits her in the PRC. That relationship \ncreates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation, pressure, and coercion \nbecause he will seek to protect her and her son, and the house for which he paid. That \ndesire makes him subject to PRC pressures, if they were to be applied. The \nrequirement to register within 24 hours of arriving in the town where his wife lives also \nplaces a risk on Applicant. AG \u00b6 7 (d) applies. \n \n \nNext, Applicant\u2019s $4,000 monthly stipend to his wife, and the cost of the house in \nthe PRC, for which Applicant paid, creates a substantial financial and property interest \nin the PRC for Applicant. The desire to protect that investment could subject Applicant \nto a heightened risk of PRC influence or exploitation. AG \u00b6 7 (e) applies.  \n \n \nFinally, Applicant owns property in the PRC and supports his wife who lives there \nand is a PRC citizen. He visited her regularly in 2008. This course of conduct makes \nApplicant vulnerable to exploitation, pressure, or coercion by the PRC because of his \nfamilial and financial connections to the PRC. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 8 provides six conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising under \nthis guideline: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n7\n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; \n \n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or \nare approved by the cognizant security authority; \n \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements \nregarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, \ngroups, or organizations from a foreign country; and, \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property  \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n  \n \nFrom these mitigating conditions, only AG \u00b6 8 (b) may have some application. \nApplicant is a U.S. citizen, and served in the U.S. Army for 20 years. He held a security \nclearance during his Army service. He understands the requirements of holding a \nsecurity clearance. As an American, he should have life-long relationships and loyalties \nto the United States. However, they are counter-balanced by his voluntary marriage to a \nPRC citizen and resident, and the substantial financial support he provides his wife, \ncurrently living in the PRC. With his military experience he should know of the PRC\u2019s \nhistorical espionage activities and the nature of a communist government. AG \u00b6 8 (b) is \nnot sufficient to mitigate the disqualifying conditions.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant=s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant=s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG & 2(a): \n \n (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual=s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG & 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.      \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n8\nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s marriage creates potential \nfor pressure and coercion. He knew the citizenship of his wife when he married her. He \nhas visited her three times in the PRC from 2006 to 2008, provided significant financial \nsupport to her for three years, and gave her money to purchase a house in the PRC. \nHis financial interests in the PRC are substantial. Applicant was an adult when he \nentered into this relationship.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and substantial doubts as \nto Applicant=s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant did not mitigate the security concerns arising under the guideline for \nForeign Influence. I conclude the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept against Applicant.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nForeign Influence:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nPHILIP S.

Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance is granted. \n \nOn June 2, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to \nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline E, \nPersonal Conduct. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on June 9, 2009, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on August 13, 2009. \nDOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on August 18, 2009. I convened the hearing as \nscheduled on September 16, 2009. The government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 6. \n \n1 \n \n \nOctober 14, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                          \nApplicant did not object and they were admitted. Applicant testified and offered Exhibits \n(AE) A through C, which were admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript \nof the hearing (Tr.) on September 22, 2009.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant denied the SOR allegations. After a thorough and careful review of the \npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 27 years old. He is employed by a federal contractor (Company C) \nas a deputy program manager. He is not married. He held various jobs in sales from \n2000 to 2004. In April 2004, he was hired by Company A as a linguist. In May 2004, he \ndeployed to Afghanistan and held an interim security clearance. He was granted a \nSecret clearance in September 2004. He served in Afghanistan, except for some leave \nperiods, until his contract ended in October 2005, when he ceased employment with \nCompany A.1  \n \n \nApplicant began employment with Company B in October 2005. He was directed \nto report to the Naval Base to board a flight to Afghanistan. Everyone manifested on the \nflight was directed to a prepositioning area. Navy personnel at the staging area asked \nApplicant his name, social security number, and date of birth, which he provided. The \ninformation was checked against a list with names that had been approved for the flight. \nHis picture was taken and he was issued a badge by the Navy with his photograph, the \nlast four digits of his social security number, and a \u201c#3\u201d in the corner of the badge. He \ndid not ask any questions about the badge or its access parameters. He was attached \nto a special operations unit.2  \n \n \nWhile in Afghanistan, Applicant conducted most of his work on the air base and \nalso took frequent trips to the field. He was not barred from entering any area. He stated \nsometime in October or November 2005, the counterintelligence (CI) officer whom he \nknew, noticed Applicant\u2019s badge. He asked him how he got the badge, and Applicant \ntold him it was issued to him at the U.S. Naval Base before he left the country. The \nbadge gave him access to Top Secret information. Applicant was unaware of the \naccess level. The CI officer investigated and determined Applicant should have been \nissued a badge at the Secret clearance level. Upon learning this from the CI officer, he \nturned in the Top Secret badge and was issued a Secret badge. The CI officer launched \nan investigation as to how Applicant received the badge. Applicant was interviewed and \nthe investigators looked into where he had been granted access. Applicant credibly \ntestified that he did not go to classified areas unless directed to do so by a superior, and \nit was usually to pick up mail or do some other type of errand. In December 2005, he \nwent home on leave and intended on returning. He was informed that the Task Force \ndid not want him back and he was barred from the base due to the badge incident. No \n \n1 Tr. 33, 44-48. Applicant served in Afghanistan from May 2004 to December 2005, working for \ntwo different employers. He returned to the U.S. for leave three times. \n \n2 Tr. 25, 41, 48-54. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                                          \nfurther explanation was provided. He did not think his clearance was revoked, but was \nonly downgraded from a Top Secret to a Secret clearance. Applicant\u2019s testimony was \ncorroborated by the Army colonel he worked for in Afghanistan. There is no evidence \nthat Applicant illegally or fraudulently obtained the badge.3   \n \n \nApplicant has worked for Company C since May 2007. He was applying for a job \nwith Company D and did not want them to know that he was working for Company C, \nbecause they are competitors. He was concerned about hurting his employment \nopportunity with Company D, and he needed to continue his employment with Company \nC, so he could pay his bills until he got a new job. In his sworn affidavit, he admitted he \nintentionally omitted his employment with Company C from his security clearance \napplication (SCA) that he completed in August 2007. He admitted filling out the SCA \nwas daunting. He stated he was conflicted and confused at the time. When he was \ninterviewed by an investigator from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) he \nprovided honest and accurate statements and acknowledged he should have listed \nCompany C. He did not intend to deceive the government by failing to list Company C \nas his employer.4 I found his testimony credible. \n \nWhen completing the SCA for Company D, Applicant was instructed by their \nsecurity officer to list Company D as his current employer, even though it was not \naccurate because he had not yet been hired.5 He stated at his hearing that he believed \nit was an industry-wide practice to list the company with whom you were seeking \nemployment when completing the SCA. He followed Company D\u2019s instructions.6 \n \n \n \nAn Army colonel who was interviewed as part of Applicant\u2019s background \ninvestigation provided the following information. Applicant served in Afghanistan as a \nlinguist and interpreter. He was considered a team player and was an action officer on \nspecial projects. The colonel had daily contact with him and they worked in a hut with \nother men. Applicant and the colonel were in constant contact. Applicant often worked \noutside of the scope of his contract. Applicant assisted with computer and information \ntechnology and administration. He would help with computer problems. His expertise \nwas the equivalent to the work of four or five people.7  \n \n \nThe colonel also commented that Applicant had been issued a badge and while \nin the U.S., he was \u201cread on\u201d by the special unit in [the U.S.] to receive a badge prior to \nhis departure for Afghanistan. He confirmed that Applicant had a \u201cneed to know\u201d and \nwas issued a Top Secret clearance, even though he was only cleared for a Secret \nclearance. The colonel confirmed that the different entities in Afghanistan were aware of \n \n3 Tr. 53-61; AE C. \n \n4 Tr. 64-86. \n \n5 GE 1 and 2. \n \n6 Tr. 23-25. \n \n7 AE C. \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                                          \nthe \u201cbadge situation,\u201d that is that Applicant had the improper badge with him in \nAfghanistan. The colonel stated he brought up the issue, but nothing was done about it. \nApplicant went to planning meetings in Afghanistan with the colonel and would \nrepresent him when he could not attend. These meetings were at the secret level.8  \n \n \nThe colonel stated that Applicant is an upstanding young man, and he would \ntrust him with his life. He commented that Applicant is loyal to the U.S. and cannot be \nblackmailed.9  \n \n \nApplicant provided a character letter from a different Army colonel. He stated \nApplicant is an exceptional young man and a proven performer with a superb work \nethic. He considers Applicant a proven warrior who is able to function in stressful \nsituations. Applicant served in Afghanistan as an interpreter against the most difficult \ntargets. Due to personnel losses, the colonel needed to call upon Applicant to assist him \nin moving critical supplies to forward units. Applicant quickly and eagerly took on this \nnew challenge. The colonel stated: \u201cHe not only accomplished the mission better than \nany military supply specialist before him, but he eventually excelled in building a \nreputation in the logistical network as someone who was able to acquire and move \ncritical supplies in and out of the most difficult areas. I would work with [Applicant] \nanytime, anywhere.\u201d10 \n \n \nApplicant has worked on the front lines in Afghanistan and acquired an expertise \nin the region and with the language. He was involved in sensitive missions and \ndetentions of high valued targets and terrorist organizations. He also has worked as an \nundercover operator in classified missions.11  \n \n \nApplicant was going through some stressful periods when he returned from \nAfghanistan. He had a period of unemployment and his wedding engagement was \ncalled off. He stated he did not have post-traumatic stress disorder, but he was feeling \nguilty about leaving his unit in Afghanistan. He found it difficult to transition back to a \nnormal life in the U.S. and felt a period of decompression.12  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \n \n8 Id. \n \n9 Id. \n \n10 AE B. \n \n11 Tr. 81-83; AE B. \n \n12 Tr. 98-100. \n\n \n5 \n \n \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I have specifically considered the following: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such \nas (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \n \n \nApplicant admitted he intentionally did not list his present employer on his SCA \nbecause he was applying for a job with a competitor and did not want his employer to \nknow. Per the direction of the security officer of the company where he was applying for \na job, he listed them as his current employer, which was not accurate. I find \ndisqualifying condition (a) applies. \n \n \nI have considered all of the evidence regarding Applicant\u2019s use of a security \nbadge that was issued to him before deploying to Afghanistan. I found Applicant\u2019s \ntestimony credible and it was corroborated by the Army colonel who served with him. \nThere is no evidence Applicant fraudulently or through misrepresentations obtained the \nbadge. Applicant was issued a badge that gave him access to Top Secret information. A \nmistake was made by someone when they issued Applicant the badge with Top Secret \naccess. He was unaware of the access level until the CI officer brought it to his \nattention. He may have had access to areas he should not have, but his badge \nauthorized him access to those areas. He cannot be held accountable for potentially \naccessing areas where his badge authorized him to be. Accountability lies with those \nwho gave him the badge in the first place. I find no disqualifying conditions apply to \nthese facts.  \n \nI have considered all of he mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 and especially \nconsidered the following:  \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \n\n \n7 \n \n \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur. \n \n \nApplicant was instructed by the security officer of Company D to list Company D \nas his present employer. He complied. I find mitigating condition (b) applies.  \n \n \nApplicant intentionally did not list his present employer on his SCA because he \ndid not want his potential employer to learn he was already employed by a competitor. \nHe credibly testified that this was not something he was trying to conceal from the \ngovernment, but that is what happened. He fully cooperated with the OPM investigator \nand provided the relevant information. He acknowledged that he should have provided \nthe information on his SCA. Although I find that Applicant did intentionally fail to provide \naccurate information, thereby falsifying his SCA, I find that it happened under unique \ncircumstances and that it is unlikely to recur. I also find that he has acknowledged his \nactions and has a better understanding of the process. He was dealing with several \nstressors in his life at the time. The action was not minor, but his behavior was an \naberration and unlikely to recur. I find under the circumstances mitigating conditions (c) \nand (d) apply.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant was mistakenly issued a \nsecurity badge that gave him Top Secret access. There is no evidence that he obtained \nthis badge fraudulently or exploited the use of the badge. He went to Afghanistan and \nserved his unit as directed. When the mistake was discovered, he returned the badge \nand was issued the correct one. The record does not provide any evidence that \nApplicant did anything wrong. A mistake was made by the officials issuing the badge, \nnot by Applicant. When completing his SCA, Applicant intentionally did not list his \ncurrent employer because he did not want his prospective employer to know he was \nworking for a competitor. This may be a common practice when seeking new job \nopportunities, but it does not excuse his failure to comply with the requirements of a \nSCA. Applicant\u2019s intent was not to conceal the information from the government, but to \nconceal it from his prospective employer. At the direction of the security officer for \nCompany D, he listed them as his current employer, which was not correct. Applicant \nwas deployed to Afghanistan under harsh conditions and completed assignments that \nhe could have refused because he was serving as a civilian contractor. Instead, he \ncompleted the assignments so the overall missions could be accomplished. His \ncommanders have attested to his service. His unique skills have allowed him to assist in \nimportant operations. I have carefully considered Applicant\u2019s actions and find they \noccurred under unique circumstances and are unlikely to recur. Overall, the record \nevidence leaves me with no questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated \nthe security concerns arising under the guideline for Personal Conduct. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nCarol G.

After reviewing the results of the ensuing background investigation,\nadjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to\nApplicant interrogatories  intended to clarify or augment background information\n2\nrelevant to his suitability for a public trust position. After reviewing the results of the\nbackground investigation and Applicant\u2019s responses to the interrogatories, DOHA\nOctober 6, 2010\n\n Required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and by DoD Directive 5220.6 (Directive), as amended.\n3\n The adjudicative guidelines were implemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006. These\n4\nguidelines were published in the Federal Register and codified through 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 154, Appendix H (2006).\nPending official revision of the Directive, they take precedence over the guidelines listed in Enclosure 2 to the\nDirective.\n Applicant is assigned to an overseas job site and coordination of the dates for his availability in the United\n5\nStates was difficult.\n2\nadjudicators were unable to make a preliminary affirmative finding  that it is clearly\n3\nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant\u2019s request for a\nposition of trust. On July 27, 2009, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons\n(SOR) alleging facts which, if proven, raise security concerns addressed in the\nadjudicative guidelines (AG)  for personal conduct (Guideline E) and financial\n4\nconsiderations (Guideline F).\nApplicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing. The case was first\nassigned to an administrative judge on March 15, 2010. After several attempts to\nschedule this matter for hearing,  the case was assigned to me on June 14, 2010.\n5\nPursuant to a Notice of Hearing issued on June 15, 2010, I convened a hearing on June\n29, 2010. The Government presented seven exhibits that were admitted without\nobjection as Government\u2019s Exhibits (Gx.) 1 - 7. Applicant testified and submitted one\nexhibit, which was admitted without objection as Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (Ax.) A. Additionally,\nI left the record open after the hearing to give Applicant time to submit additional\nrelevant information. DOHA received a transcript of the hearing on July 7, 2010. The\nrecord closed on July 9, 2010, when I received Applicant\u2019s post-hearing submission,\nwhich was admitted without objection as Ax. B.\nFindings of Fact\nUnder Guideline F, the Government alleged that Applicant owed about $33,883\nfor 22 delinquent debts (SOR 1.a - 1.v), and that he was arrested in June 2007 and\ncharged with Fraud - Insufficient Funds Checks (SOR 1.w). Applicant admitted all of the\nallegations under this guideline.\nUnder Guideline E, the Government alleged that Applicant falsified his SF 85P by\nanswering \u201cyes\u201d to question 20 (Your Financial Record - 180-Day Delinquencies. Are\nyou now over 180 days delinquent on any loan or financial obligation?), listed only an\nunpaid student loan debt, and did not list the debts alleged in SOR 1.a - 1.v. (SOR 2.a).\nThe Government also alleged that Applicant failed to cooperate with an authorized\nGovernment investigator by failing to provide a personal financial statement during a\nsubject interview on October 23, 2008. (SOR 2.b) Applicant denied these allegations. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. Having reviewed\nApplicant\u2019s response to the SOR, the transcript, and exhibits, I make the following\nadditional findings of relevant fact.\n\n The debt alleged at SOR 1.d is for the same account alleged in SOR 1.c. (Tr. 67 - 68)\n6\n3\nApplicant is 35 years old, and is employed by a defense contractor in a logistics\nsupport position that requires access to sensitive automated information to perform his\nduties. He has held his current job, first as a \u201ctemp\u201d agency employee, then as a\ncompany employee, since April 2008. (Gx. 1) Applicant served on active duty in the\nU.S. Army from November 1996 until March 2004. He served in a reserve status in the\nArmy National Guard from 2005 until 2008. He was deployed to Iraq from November\n2005 to November 2006. (Gx. 1; Gx. 2; Ax. A; Tr. 5)\nApplicant has been steadily employed, albeit in a series of lower-paying jobs,\nsince his discharge from active duty. Aside from his deployment to Iraq, he held four\njobs between March 2004 and April 2008. His average stay at each job was about eight\nmonths. (Gx. 1; Tr. 55) While Applicant was in the Army, he earned about $2,200 each\nmonth after taxes. (Tr. 54) His income at the time allowed him to keep up with a variety\nof credit obligations he incurred, such as two car payments, a loan for furniture, and\ncredit cards. Some of his obligations were paid through direct payroll allotments.\nHowever, when he left the Army, those allotments stopped, and Applicant did not\ncontinue to pay his debts directly. \nApplicant\u2019s current job requires that he work overseas, which he has done since\nFebruary 2010. His pay between April 2008 and January 2010 was about $11.90 per\nhour for a 40-hour work week, for a gross monthly salary of about $1,900. For his\noverseas work, he now earns about $87,000 annually tax free. His monthly take-home\npay is about $6,400. (Tr. 49 - 54)\nAs a result of Applicant\u2019s discharge and uneven work history since 2004,\nApplicant has accrued about $33,600 for 21 of the 22 delinquent debts alleged in the\nSOR.  (Answer to SOR; Tr. 88 - 89; Gx. 3; Gx. 4; Gx. 5; Gx. 6) He asserted at the\n6\nhearing that he has paid all or some of his debts.  Under cross-examination, however,\nApplicant admitted that he has not acted on most of his debts. He averred, however,\nthat he has paid off, or is making payments to, the debts alleged at SOR 1.b, 1.c, 1.h,\n1.m, and 1.t. (Tr. 62 - 86) Delinquent student loans from 2004 (SOR 1.q, and 1.r) have\nbeen satisfied, albeit through attachment of Applicant\u2019s income tax refunds over the\npast five years. (Tr. 61 - 62; Ax. B)\nApplicant\u2019s larger debts include a $5,000 unpaid medical bill from October 2008\n(SOR 1.a). Applicant attended a professional football game and was hospitalized after\nhe collapsed from heat exhaustion. Despite being employed by his current company, he\nhad no health insurance to cover the bill. He assumes his mother has been handling\nthis debt. (Tr. 62 - 63) Another large debt is for a $2,141 delinquent loan from a bank\nthat caters to military personnel (SOR 1.g). Applicant also owes $5,782 for an April\n2004 car repossession (SOR 1.p), and $6,299 for a February 2007 car repossession\n(SOR 1.s). As with most of his other debts, Applicant has not acted to pay or otherwise\nresolve these obligations.\n\n4\nApplicant was married from 1996 until 2002, when he and his ex-wife divorced.\nHe has two child (ages 12 and 10) from that marriage. He has custody of the children,\nwho live with their maternal grandmother when he is overseas. (Gx. 1; Tr. 103 - 105)\nApplicant sends about $1,000 each month to the grandmother for the care of his\nchildren. He also sends about $1,400 each month to his mother so she can pay his bills.\nWhen Applicant testified that he had paid some of the debts alleged in the SOR, he\nmeant that his mother had made the payments using money he had sent her. (Tr. 63,\n67, 93)\nApplicant testified that he had proof of his claims of payment. Despite being\nallowed extra time to produce documentation of those claims (Tr. 112 - 113), Applicant\nonly provided documentation of the student loans paid through tax refund diversions,\nand payment of a $315 debt that was not alleged in the SOR. (Ax. B)\nWhen Applicant submitted his SF 85P in August 2008, he disclosed that he was\narrested in June 2007 on a warrant for issuing checks against insufficient funds.\nApplicant explained that he wrote three checks totaling about $400 while he was\ndeployed to Iraq. He did not know they had bounced until he went to the local sheriff\u2019s\noffice on another matter and was arrested. Applicant spent one night in jail and made\nrestitution the next day. (Tr. 87 - 88; Gx. 3; Gx. 7)\nIn response to SF 85P question 20, which asked if he was currently more than\n180 days past due on any debt or obligation, he disclosed only that he was delinquent\non his student loans. (Gx. 1) Applicant explained at an October 23, 2008, interview at\nApplicant\u2019s workplace with a Government investigator, and at his hearing, that he\ncompleted the questionnaire by hand and that someone else input the information into\nthe automated form used by investigators. He also explained that when he completed\nthe SF 85P, there was no room to list any of his other debts. Applicant reviewed the\nprinted version of the SF 85P and signed it immediately below an advisement that 18\nU.S.C. \u00a7 1001 makes it a crime to knowingly and willfully make a false statement to any\nagency of the U.S. Government concerning a matter within its jurisdiction. (Tr. 97 - 98;\nGx. 1)\nAt the October 23, 2008, subject interview, Applicant and the Government\ninvestigator discussed in detail the available information about Applicant\u2019s finances.\nAnother interview was conducted, again at Applicant\u2019s workplace, on December 1,\n2008, to discuss the information about Applicant\u2019s arrest for worthless checks and the\nomissions from Applicant\u2019s SF 85P. (Gx. 3)\nApplicant testified that, aside from the delinquent debts listed in the SOR, his\ncurrent finances are sound. He averred that he makes his car loan, cell phone, and\nother monthly payments on time, and that he has money left over each month even\nafter sending his mother and his children\u2019s maternal grandmother about $2400 each\nmonth. (Tr. 92 - 93) He did not, however, provide any documentation of his current\nfinances. Further, the Government has alleged (SOR 2.b) that Applicant failed to\ncooperate with the investigating agent by refusing to provide a financial statement\nduring the October 23, 2008, interview. Applicant denied this allegation, but\nacknowledged that he questioned the need for that information, and that he did not like\n\n Directive. 6.3.\n7\n5\nthe fact that the interview was held at his workplace as it was embarrassing to\nApplicant. Additionally, the summary of that interview corroborates the SOR 2.b\nallegation, and Applicant agreed that it is an accurate account of what happened.\nAccordingly, without the personal financial statement requested during his background\ninvestigation, and absent any corroborating documentation to support his testimony, I\ncannot conclude that Applicant\u2019s finances have improved or that he is able to repay any\nof his past-due debts. (Tr. 24, 47, 100 - 101; Gx. 3).\nApplicant was a highly trained transportation specialist in the Army. He received\nnumerous awards, commendations, and personal decorations on both active duty and\nin the Army National Guard. He received an honorable discharge each time he was\nreleased from active duty. His awards include multiple certificates of appreciation and\nachievement, two Army Achievement Medals, two Army Commendation Medals, and\nmultiple Army Good Conduct Medals. (Ax. A)\n \nPolicies\nPositions designated as ADP I/II/III are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d\nRegulation, \u00b6 C3.6.15. In deciding whether a person should be assigned to an ADP\nposition, it must be determined that his or her loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are\nsuch that it is \u201cclearly consistent with the interests of national security\u201d to do so.\nRegulation, \u00b6 C6.1.1.1. The Regulation also requires that DoD contractor personnel are\nentitled to the procedural protections in the Directive before any adverse determination\nmay be made. Regulation, \u00b6 C8.2.1. \nThe Directive requires that each decision be a fair, impartial, and commonsense\ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information,7\nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policies in the adjudicative\nguidelines. Decisions must also reflect consideration of the factors listed in \u00b6 2(a) of the\nnew guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept, those factors are:\n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not, by itself,\nconclusive. However, specific applicable guidelines should be followed whenever a case\ncan be measured against them as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or\ndenial of eligibility for a position of trust.\n\n As a duplicate debt, SOR 1.d is resolved for the Applicant.\n8\n6\nThe Government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on\nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a position of trust for an\napplicant. Additionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts\nalleged in the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to\nrefute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one is entitled to a\nposition of trust, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion. A person who has\naccess to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government\nbased on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a compelling interest in\nensuring applicants possess the requisite judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness of\none who will protect sensitive information as his or her own. Any reasonable doubt\nabout an applicant\u2019s suitability for access should be resolved in favor of the\nGovernment.\nAnalysis\nFinancial\nThe security concern about Applicant\u2019s finances, as stated in AG \u00b6 18, is that:\nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nThe Government presented sufficient information to support the allegations in\nSOR 1.a - 1.c, and 1.e - 1.u;  that is, that Applicant accrued at least $33,600 for 21\n8\ndelinquent debts (SOR 1.a - 1.y); and that he was arrested in June 2007 and charged\nwith passing worthless checks (SOR 1.v). Available information also showed that the\nonly debt that has been paid was done through involuntary attachment of his tax\nrefunds to satisfy a federally-guaranteed student loan. Despite improved finances since\nFebruary 2010, Applicant has not acted to pay or otherwise resolve his debts, some of\nwhich have been delinquent since 2004. Thus, the record requires application of the\ndisqualifying conditions listed at AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts),\nand AG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations).\nBy contrast, Applicant claimed that he had paid or resolved some of his debts.\nThe record does not support his claims. Applicant also asserted that his present\nfinances are sound and will allow him to resolve his debts if given the chance. However,\nApplicant did not explain why he took no action to resolve his debts when his income\nincreased. Instead, he gave conflicting and misleading statements about his efforts to\npay his debts. In light of his refusal to provide information about his finances when\nasked by a Government investigator, it is clear that Applicant does not appreciate the\ntrustworthiness significance of managing his finances in a responsible manner.\n\n Directive, 6.1.\n9\n7\nAvailable information does not support application of any of the mitigating conditions\nlisted at AG 20. Applicant did not present information that would support his claims of\npayment, or that would otherwise extenuate or mitigate the Government\u2019s concerns\nabout his unpaid debts.\nPersonal Conduct\nAs stated at AG \u00b6 15, the security concern about Applicant\u2019s answers to his SF\n85P is that:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nThe Government\u2019s information showed, in relevant part, that when he submitted\nhis SF 85P in May 2008, Applicant was more than 180 days delinquent on numerous\ndebts. Yet, when he answered SF 85P question 20, he listed only his delinquent student\nloans, which, at the time, were being addressed through involuntary diversion of his tax\nrefunds. Applicant denied any intent to mislead the Government about his finances,\nclaiming instead that he was unable to include all of the requested information on the\nform provided. Yet neither did he inform anyone that he had other debts to list, nor ask\nfor help in completing the form. \nThe Government\u2019s information also showed that Applicant refused to cooperate\nwith a Government investigator during his background investigation. During a subject\ninterview in October 2008, Applicant was asked to provide a personal financial\nstatement to augment the information contained in credit reports the investigator had\nobtained. Applicant refused and took issue with the investigator\u2019s request to interview\nApplicant at his work site. \nApplicants for positions of trust and for security clearances are investigated as\nspecified in DoD Regulation 5200.2-R.  More specifically, the importance of\n9\ninvestigating positions that access sensitive, as well as classified, information is\naddressed in this Regulation as follows:\nC3.1.1. Designation of Sensitive Positions. Certain civilian positions within\nthe Department of Defense entail duties of such a sensitive nature\nincluding access to classified information, that the misconduct,\nmalfeasance, or nonfeasance of an incumbent in any such position could\nresult in an unacceptably adverse impact upon the national security.\nThese positions are referred to in this Regulation as sensitive positions. It\nis vital to the national security that great care be exercised in the selection\nof individuals to fill such positions.\n\n8\nDoD Regulation 5200.2-R, C3.1.1.\nA review of DoD Regulation 5200.2-R shows that a subject interview is a basic\nrequirement of any background investigation, and that the scope of the investigation\nmay be expanded as necessary \u201cto resolve unfavorable or questionable information.\u201d\n(DoD Regulation 5200.2-R, C2.3.5, AP1.1.1.2.4, and AP1.1.1.4.2.3). More specifically,\nDoD Regulation 5200.2-R, C2.3.5 requires, inter alia, that a person\u2019s finances are\nrelevant to any background investigation. Available information shows that the October\n2008 subject interview was conducted consistent with regulation standards \nIn short, the investigator was doing his job. Applicant was required to cooperate\nand to be candid and forthcoming in his responses to the investigator\u2019s questions and\nrequests for information. Applicant was not entitled to object to the location of the\ninterview, and his refusal to provide a personal financial statement or other such\nrelevant information raises a concern addressed in AG \u00b6 15 as follows:\nThe following will normally result in an unfavorable clearance action or\nadministrative termination of further processing for clearance eligibility:\n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or cooperate\nwith security processing, including but not limited to meeting with a\nsecurity investigator for subject interview, completing security forms or\nreleases, and cooperation with medical or psychological evaluation; \nAs to the allegation that Applicant deliberately falsified his answer to SF 85P\nquestion 20, Applicant\u2019s explanation might seem plausible were this the only concern\nabout his credibility. However, taken in context with his refusal to provide information\nrequested by the Government investigator, as well as his inconsistent or uncorroborated\ntestimony about his finances, it is clear that the Applicant is unwilling to be candid with\nthe Government about relevant and material information in his background. Accordingly,\nhis conduct also requires application of the disqualifying conditions at AG \u00b6 16(a)\n(deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel\nsecurity questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct\ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities).\nBy contrast, Applicant\u2019s testimony, characterized above, precludes consideration\nof any of the AG \u00b6 17 mitigating conditions that might apply to the facts of this case.\nApplicant did not make any attempt to timely correct his SF 85P omissions. Rather, he\nrefused to cooperate with a Government investigator during a subject interview about\nhis finances in October 2008. At his hearing, Applicant\u2019s testimony was not credible,\noften conflicting, and without corroboration of his claims he is resolving his financial\nproblems. Accordingly, Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns raised by\nhis false answers to the SF 85P and by his refusal to cooperate with a Government\ninvestigator.\n\n9\nWhole-Person Concept\nI have evaluated the facts presented and have applied the appropriate\nadjudicative factors under Guidelines E and F. I have also reviewed the record before\nme in the context of the whole-person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a). Applicant is 35 years\nold and is presumed to be a mature, responsible adult. In addition to his work for a\ndefense contractor, he served his country for 11 years in the Army and the Army\nNational Guard. Available information shows that he was a well-trained soldier who\nearned numerous accolades for his service. However, this favorable information is\ninsufficient to overcome the adverse inferences to be drawn from his poor financial\nhistory, his unwillingness to resolve his debts, and his unwillingness to be candid and\nforthcoming about information in his background, as required by applicable regulations.\nApplicant had the burden of resolving the doubts raised about his suitability for access\nto sensitive information, but he failed to meet that burden. As a result, doubts about his\njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness remain. Because protection of the national\ninterest is paramount in these determinations, those doubts must be resolved in favor of\nthe Government.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.e - 1.v:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a - 2.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of\nnational security to allow Applicant to have access to sensitive information. Request for\na position of trust is denied.\n                                         \nMATTHEW E. MALONE\nAdministrative Judge\n",

He has a history of not paying his legal obligations. He presented no \ndocumentary evidence of good-faith efforts to pay, settle, or resolve his delinquent \ndebts. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn September 24, 2009, Applicant submitted a security clearance application. \nOn August 27, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended; \nDepartment of Defense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as revised; and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on September 1, 2006.  \n \nThe \nSOR \nalleges \nsecurity \nconcerns \nunder \nGuideline \nF \n(Financial \nConsiderations). It detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary \n \n1 \n \n \nJune 17, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n \naffirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for him, and recommended referral to \nan administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted or denied. \n \nApplicant\u2019s response to the SOR allegations (undated) was received by DOHA \non September 18, 2009. He elected to have his case decided on the written record in \nlieu of a hearing. (Item 4) A complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM), dated \nOctober 16, 2009, was provided to him by letter dated August 19, 2009. Applicant \nsigned the receipt for the DOHA transmittal letter on October 28, 2009. He was given 30 \ndays to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. \nApplicant did not respond. The case was assigned to me on February 4, 2010. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, 1.d, 1.g-1.i, 1.k, 1.l, 1.o, \n1.s, 1.t, 1.v, and 1.aa-1.dd. He denied the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.e, 1.f, 1.j, 1.m, \n1.n, 1.p-1.r, 1.u, 1.w-1.z, and 1.ee. His admissions are incorporated herein as findings \nof fact. After a thorough review of the evidence of record, and having considered \nApplicant\u2019s answers to the SOR, I make the following additional findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is a 37-year-old associate cable fabricator employed by a defense \ncontractor. He served in the U.S. Marine Corps from November 1996 until June 1998, \nand was honorably discharged (FORM Item 5). He is receiving disability benefits from \nthe Veterans Administration (VA) (Item 6). He has attended college since 2004, and \nreceived his associate\u2019s degree in August 2006. He married his first wife in 1996 and \nthey were divorced in 2000. He married his second wife in October 2006. As of his \nNovember 2008 interview, he was separated from his second wife. He has two children, \nages 11 and 8.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s security clearance application indicates he was employed part-time \nas an installation technician from June 1998 until February 2007. He was unemployed \nfrom February 2007 until March 2008. He has been employed since March 2008. He \nwas hired by his current employer, a government contractor, in July 2008. \n \nApplicant disclosed in his September 2008 security clearance application that he \nhad financial problems. In November 2008, Applicant was interviewed about his \nnumerous delinquent accounts. During the interview, Applicant stated he had been \nstruggling financially due to his unemployment. He claimed his financial problems were \nnot due to use of drugs, alcohol, gambling, or any criminal activity. He stated that he \nlives well below his means, has eliminated any unnecessary expenses, and is \nattempting to follow a budget. He intends to pay his delinquent debts and to repair his \ncredit when he is financially able to do so. (Item 6). \n \nIn May 2009, Applicant answered DOHA\u2019s detailed financial interrogatories \nconcerning most of the debts alleged in the SOR. (Item 7) In his response, Applicant \nstated he was disputing the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.q; he did not recognize the \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                           \ncreditors of SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.e, 1.f, 1.r, 1.u, 1.w, 1.x, 1.y, 1.z, and 1.ee; and he was \nrequesting information on the accounts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j and 1.p. He also claimed he \nwould settle and pay some debts within a certain time, and that he was in settlement \nnegotiations with other creditors. Applicant presented no documentary evidence of \ngood-faith efforts to dispute, pay, settle, or otherwise resolve any of his delinquent \ndebts. Applicant\u2019s admissions to the SOR and both credit reports establish that the SOR \ndebts are Applicant\u2019s unresolved debts. \n \nApplicant\u2019s May 2009 personal financial statement indicates his net monthly \nsalary is $2,117, including a $117 VA disability payment. He listed $1,280 monthly \nexpenses, including $150 in child support. His monthly net remainder is approximately \n$800. Applicant\u2019s personal financial statement listed no scheduled or actual payments \non any debts. He stated that the interrogatories contained all his financial obligations, \nand that he was waiting for information to address the debts. Applicant presented no \nevidence of any financial counseling or remorse for his financial situation.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. They provide \nexplanations for each guideline and list potentially disqualifying conditions and \nmitigating conditions, which must be considered in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s goal is to achieve a \nfair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. AG \u00b6 2(c). \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d  \n \nIn the decision-making process, the government has the initial burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR by \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d1 Once the \ngovernment has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, the burden \nshifts to applicant to produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts \n \n1 See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d ISCR Case \nNo. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore \nthan a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d \n375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                           \nadmitted by applicant or proven by department counsel, and [applicant] has the ultimate \nburden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \ngovernment.2 \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nUnder Guideline F, the security concern is that failure or inability to live within \none\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-\ncontrol, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified information. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having \nto engage in illegal acts to generate funds. AG \u00b6 18. \n \nThe SOR alleges 31 delinquent debts totaling approximately $18,000. Applicant \nadmitted to 14 delinquent debts totaling $10,539, three of which are for less than $100. \nHis history of financial problems dates back ten years. Since 2000, he has been \nrepeatedly delinquent in paying his legal obligations. Applicant presented no \ndocumentary evidence of good-faith efforts to pay, settle, or resolve his delinquent \ndebts. AG \u00b6 19(a): \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c): \u201ca history \nof not meeting financial obligations\u201d apply.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 lists six conditions that could mitigate the financial considerations \nsecurity concerns:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n \n2 See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n\n \n5 \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts;  \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n \n \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income. \n \n \nThe record shows some circumstances beyond his control, which could have \ncontributed to his inability to pay his debts, i.e., his divorce, separation from his current \nwife, and his period of unemployment. I find AG \u00b6 20(b) partially applies, but does not \nfully mitigate the financial concerns. Applicant\u2019s scant evidence is not sufficient to show \nhe acted responsibly under the circumstances. In light of his approximately $800 net \nremainder after paying his day-to-day living expenses, he failed to explain why he has \nnot responsibly addressed his delinquent debts.  \n \n \nApplicant presented no documentary evidence of good-faith efforts to pay, settle, \nor resolve his delinquent debts since the day he acquired them. None of the mitigating \ncircumstances apply. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider \nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n\n \n6 \n \n \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be \nan overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines \nand the whole-person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c).   \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant served two years in the \nMarine Corps, and receives a VA disability payment. He has worked for a government \ncontractor since 2008. He is a mature man and a good worker. There is no evidence he \nhas ever compromised or caused others to compromise classified information. These \nfactors show some responsibility, good judgment, and mitigation. Applicant also \nestablished some circumstances beyond his control, which contributed to his inability to \npay his debts.  \n \nNotwithstanding, Applicant\u2019s scant evidence is not sufficient to show he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances.

Nagel, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\nJune 14, 2010\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nCEFOLA, Richard A., Administrative Judge:\nThe Applicant submitted her Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations\nProcessing (e-QIP) on October 10, 2008.  On August 6, 2009, the Defense Office of\nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the\nsecurity concerns under Guideline J for the Applicant.  The action was taken under\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February\n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended\n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on\nDecember 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued\nafter September 1, 2006. \nThe Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on August 10, 2009.  She\nanswered the SOR in writing on October 5, 2009, and requested a hearing before an\nAdministrative Judge.  DOHA received the request on October 9, 2009, and the case\nwas assigned to another Judge on November 16, 2009.  It was reassigned to the\nundersigned on February 9, 2010.  DOHA initially issued a notice of hearing on January\n\n2\n14, 2010, setting the case for hearing on February 10, 2010.  As the Applicant was out\nof the country on a last minute business trip, the case was rescheduled and heard on\nMarch 11, 2010.  The Government offered Exhibits (GXs) 1 through 3, which were\nreceived without objection.  The Applicant testified on her own behalf, as did her friend\nof 27 years.  The Applicant submitted Exhibits (AppXs) A through F, which were\nreceived without objection.  DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (TR) on March\n23, 2010.  I granted the Applicant\u2019s request to keep the record open until April 11, 2010,\nto submit additional matters.  On April 1, 2010, she submitted Exhibit G, through\nDepartment Counsel, who forwarded it to the undersigned on April 9, 2010.  It was\nreceived without objection. The record closed on April 11, 2010.  Based upon a review\nof the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nIn her Answer to the SOR, the Applicant admitted the factual allegations in\nSubparagraph 1.a., of the SOR, with explanations.  She denied, in part, the factual\nallegations in Subparagraph 1.b. of the SOR.  She also provided additional information\nto support her request for eligibility for a security clearance.\nGuideline J - Criminal Conduct\n1.a.  The Applicant was very close to her brother who suffered from asthma.  (TR\nat page 31 line 17 to page 32 line 23.)  In October of 1998, they shared an apartment;\nand while she was away, he suffered \u201ca massive heart attack and upper respiratory\nfailure,\u201d which led to his death.  (Id.)  She felt guilty, and opines \u201cif I was home, maybe I\ncould have saved him or maybe I could have kept him from dying alone.\u201d  (TR at page\n31 line 17 to page 32 line 23.)  She was devastated, and was told by \u201ca good friend of . .\n. [her] brother\u201d that methamphetamine \u201cwould help . . . numb the pain.\u201d  (TR at page 34\nline 4 to page 39 line 4.)  He supplied her with the drug, and soon thereafter became\nher boy friend.  (Id.)  Unbeknownst to the Applicant, he was an informant for the FBI.\n(TR at page 39 line 20 to page 47 line 25.)  On four occasions, he sent her monies and\nasked her to mail him the drugs to another state where he lived, which she did.  (Id.)\n1.b.  In June of 1999, per her \u201cboy friend\u2019s\u201d request, the Applicant brought him\nthe drugs by airplane; and was later arrested at his apartment by the FBI.  (TR at page\n39 line 20 to page 47 line 25.)  She made no profit from the drug transactions, she was\na mere \u201cmiddleman.\u201d  (Id.)  She was charged, in part, with Distribution of a Controlled\nSubstance (5 counts).  (TR at page 48 line 1 to page 52 line 10, and GX 3.)  In August\nof 2001, she was found guilty of the Distribution charges, and sentenced to 48 months\nin prison, and to five years of supervised probation.  (Id.)  She, in fact, served 11\nmonths in jail, and the period of her probation was reduced to 36 months and completed\nin May of 2007.  (TR at page 48 line 1 to page 52 line 10, and GX 3, and AppX F at\npages 1~3.)\n\n3\nHer last illegal drug involvement was in June of 1999.  Since her release from\njail, the Applicant has lived a stellar life.  (TR at page 55 line 19 to page 56 line 14, at\npage 59 line 17 to page 62 line 20, at page 64 lines 1~23, and AppXs A~G.)  She is\nnow married, actively involve in both the workplace and in her community, and those\nwho know the Applicant well have only positive comments as to how she has turned her\nlife around.  (Id, and TR at page 22 line 14 to page 27 line 12.)\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG).  In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law.  Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process.  The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision.  According to AG\nParagraph 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables\nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d  The administrative judge must consider all\navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and\nunfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.\nParagraph 2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for\naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d  In\nreaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical\nand based on the evidence contained in the record.  Likewise, I have avoided drawing\ninferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive Paragraph E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to\nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR.  Under Directive Paragraph E3.1.15,\nthe Applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut,\nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department\nCounsel. . . .\u201d  The Applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a\nfavorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.  This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours.  The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration\nof the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information.  Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\n\n4\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d  See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).\nAnalysis\nGuideline J - Criminal Conduct\nParagraph 30 of the adjudicative guidelines sets out the security concern relating\nto Criminal Conduct:\nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person=s judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness.  By its very nature, it calls into question a person=s ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\nThe adjudicative guidelines set out certain conditions that could raise security\nconcerns.  Paragraph 31(a) provides that \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser\noffenses\u201d may raise security concerns.  She was convicted for the distribution of\nmethamphetamine in August of 2001.  Paragraph 31(c) provides that an \u201callegation or\nadmission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged,\nformally prosecuted or convicted,@ may also raise security concerns.  She used\nmethamphetamine after the death of her brother in October of 1998 until her arrest in\nJune of 1999.  Here, these are clearly countered by the mitigating condition in\nSubparagraph 32(a) as \u201cso much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior\nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment.\u201d  The Applicant\u2019s arrest and drug involvement was more than ten years ago.\nShe has long since paid her debt to society with her incarceration, and her probation\nwas successfully completed in May of 2007, three years ago.\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances.  Under AG Paragraph 2(c), the ultimate\ndetermination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be an overall\ncommonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the\nwhole-person concept.  The Administrative Judge should also consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG Paragraph 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\n\n5\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nI considered all of the evidence, including the potentially disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions surrounding this case.  The Applicant has the unqualified support\nof those who know her in the work place and in her community (AppXs A~G).  The\nrecord evidence leaves me with no questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and\nsuitability for a security clearance.  For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has\nmitigated the security concerns arising from her Criminal Conduct, which occurred more\nthan a decade ago.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\nRichard A. Cefola\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Minster, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nO\u2019BRIEN, Rita C., Administrative Judge:\nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I\nconclude that Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by his drug\ninvolvement and personal conduct. Accordingly, his request for a security clearance is\ndenied.\nOn September 11, 2008, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for\nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) to request a security clearance (Item 5). After\nreviewing the results of the ensuing background investigation, adjudicators for the\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) were unable to make a preliminary\naffirmative finding  that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\n1\nApplicant\u2019s request. \nOctober 21, 2009\n\n Adjudication of this case is controlled by the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, approved by the President on\n2\nDecember 29, 2005,which were implemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006. Pending\nofficial revision of the Directive, the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines supercede the guidelines listed in\nEnclosure 2 to the Directive, and they apply to all adjudications or trustworthiness determinations in which an\nSOR was issued on or after September 1, 2006.\n See Directive, Enclosure 3, Section E3.1.7.\n3\n2\nOn July 9, 2009, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (Statement\nof Reasons) (Item 1) that specified the basis for its decision: security concerns\naddressed in the Directive under Guideline H (Drug Involvement) and Guideline E\n(Personal Conduct) of the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG).  Applicant received\n2\nthe SOR on July 13, 2009. He signed his notarized Answer on July 22, 2009, in which\nhe admitted to all the allegations listed under Guidelines H and E in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1 and 2. In\nhis Answer, Applicant also requested a decision without a hearing. DOHA Department\nCounsel submitted a file of relevant materials (FORM),  dated August 20, 2009, which\n3\nincluded eight documents (Items 1 - 8) proffered in support of the government\u2019s case.\nApplicant received the FORM on August 25, 2009 and was given 30 days to file a\nresponse. He timely submitted a Response to the FORM, dated September 1, 2009.\nThe case was assigned to me on October 7, 2009.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant\u2019s admissions in response to the SOR are admitted as fact. After a\nthorough review of the pleadings, Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, and the FORM\nsubmitted by the government, I make the following additional findings of fact.\nApplicant is 39 years old. He attended community college from 1993 to 1995;\nthe record is silent as to whether he received a degree. He served on active duty in the\nU.S. Army in 1991, but received a medical discharge after two months. Applicant is\nemployed in the information technology field, and as of April 2009, he held the position\nof lead systems integrator. He married in 1994, and has three children, ranging in age\nfrom one year to thirteen years old (Items 5, 6).\nApplicant started smoking marijuana in high school, approximately in the mid to\nlate 1980s. The extent of his use of marijuana in the 1990s is unclear from the record.\nHowever, on one occasion when he was using it in June 1993, he was charged with\npossession of marijuana. Applicant was approximately 23 years old at the time. He was\nfined and sentenced to one year unsupervised probation. Applicant stated during his\nsubject interview that he had no reason for his continuous marijuana use except that it\nrelaxed him. Between 2001 and 2008, when Applicant was approximately 31 to 38\nyears old, he used marijuana approximately 100 times, usually in social settings. He\nalso purchased marijuana about once per year, but did not sell it. His last use was June\n2008 (Item 6).\nIn June 2005, Applicant experimented with cocaine, using it three or four times.\nHe did not purchase or sell it, and has no intention to use it again (Item 6).\n\n Directive. 6.3.\n4\n See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n5\n3\nApplicant stated in his Response to the Statement of Reasons that he has \u201cnot\nused any illegal drugs in nearly a year...\u201d and has no intention to use illegal drugs in the\nfuture \u201cdue to his security clearance.\u201d  His current employer does not conduct random\ndrug tests. The record does not indicate whether Applicant has participated in a drug\ntreatment program (Response; Item 6).\nIn October 2003, when Applicant completed a Questionnaire for Public Trust\nPositions, he did not disclose his marijuana use. In 2007, he applied for a secret\nsecurity clearance by completing an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations\nProcessing (e-QIP). He did not disclose either his marijuana or cocaine use on the\napplication. In September 2008, when he completed another Electronic Questionnaire\nfor Investigations Processing (e-QIP), he did admit his use of these illegal drugs. In his\nResponse, Applicant admits that he \u201cwas not completely honest in my applications for\nclearances in 2003 and 2007\u2013I omitted information about my use of certain illegal\ndrugs, both in the past and at the current time.\u201d He notes that he was immature, was\nconcerned that he might be criminally prosecuted, and also was afraid that such a\ndisclosure would result in his being denied a security clearance. When he completed an\nElectronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) in 2008, he disclosed his\ndrug use, and his arrest for marijuana possession, because he wanted to \u201cwipe the slate\nclean and not have this hanging over my head for the rest of my life.\u201d Currently,\nApplicant believes that using illegal drugs is \u201cnot worth the trouble it causes.\u201d He is\n\u201cperfectly willing to submit to random drug tests, complete a treatment program, sign a\nstatement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for any violation, or take all of\nthese actions.\u201d (Response; Items 5, 7, 8).\nPolicies\nA security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense\ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information,\nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the Revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG).  The presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating\n4\ncondition is not determinative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However,\nspecific applicable guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured\nagainst them as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access\nto classified information. In this case, the pleadings and the information presented by\nthe parties require consideration of the security concerns and adjudicative factors\naddressed under Guideline H (Drug Involvement) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct).\nA security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest  for an applicant to either receive or continue to\n5\nhave access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of\nproducing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision to deny or\n\n See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n6\n See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).\n7\n4\nrevoke a security clearance for an applicant. Additionally, the government must be able\nto prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it\nthen falls to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case.\nBecause no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an applicant bears a heavy\nburden of persuasion.  A person who has access to classified information enters into a\n6\nfiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the\ngovernment has a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the\nrequisite judgement, reliability and trustworthiness to protect the national interests as his\nor her own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels\nresolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of\nthe government.7\nAnalysis\nGuideline H, Drug Involvement\nUnder Guideline H, AG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug\ninvolvement:\nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may\nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person's ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\nThe record shows that Applicant admits to using illegal drugs, including a brief\nuse of cocaine and extensive use of marijuana. He began using marijuana in high\nschool in the 1980s. In 1993, he was arrested on a charge of marijuana possession and\nserved one year probation. Applicant admits to purchasing marijuana, and to using it\nfrom 2001 to 2008, including after being granted a security clearance in 2007. Three\ndisqualifying conditions apply: AG \u00b6 25(a) (any drug abuse); AG \u00b6 25(c) (illegal drug\npossession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or\ndistribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia); and AG \u00b6 25(g) (any illegal drug use\nafter being granted a security clearance).\nTwo mitigating conditions are relevant: AG \u00b6 26(a) (the behavior happened so\nlong ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to\nrecur or does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment) and AG \u00b6 26(b) (a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the\nfuture, such as: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;\n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \n\n5\n(3) an appropriate period of abstinence; and,\n(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of\nclearance for any violation).\nApplicant\u2019s illegal drug use is not in the distant past, since his last known use\noccurred 16 months ago. Moreover, Applicant used marijuana for seven years between\n2001 and June 2008. He was using it when he applied for a public trust position in 2003,\nand when he applied for a security clearance in 2007. Applicant\u2019s conduct casts serious\ndoubt on his trustworthiness. AG \u00b6 26(a) does not apply. \nThere is no evidence that Applicant disassociated from his friends with whom he\nused drugs. Although he is willing to submit a statement concerning his future intent, he\nhas not done so. Applicant\u2019s abstinence since June 2008 is commendable; however, it\nis a much shorter span of time than the period that he used illegal drugs. It is too short\nto confidently predict that he will not return to illegal drug use in the future. AG \u00b6 26(b)\ndoes not apply. I find against Applicant on Guideline H.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nApplicant falsified his responses to drug-related questions when he completed\napplications in 2003 and 2007 because he was concerned that he might be prosecuted\nfor illegal conduct and he feared that his request for a security clearance would be\ndenied. AG \u00b6 16(a) applies (deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant\nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar\nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award\nbenefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award\nfiduciary responsibilities). \nThe potentially applicable mitigators are AG \u00b6 17(a) (the individual made prompt,\ngood-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification before being\nconfronted with the facts) and AG \u00b6 17(c) (the offense is so minor, or so much time has\npassed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment). However, these conditions do not apply.\nThe record contains no evidence that Applicant attempted to inform the government of\n\n6\nhis drug use after falsifying his public trust position application in 2003 or his security\nclearance application in 2007. His decision to disclose the true facts in 2008 does not\nconstitute a good-faith effort to correct his falsifications, nor does it mitigate his previous\nwillingness to deliberately conceal relevant and material information that the\ngovernment required in order to determine his trustworthiness. AG \u00b6 17(a) does not\napply. In addition, under AG \u00b6 17(c), Applicant\u2019s falsification cannot be considered either\nminor or isolated. Applicant made a conscious decision to provide false information to\nthe government not once, but on two separate occasions, four years apart. The\ngovernment relies on information provided by applicants, and deliberate falsification\nboth undermines the security clearance process, and casts serious doubts on an\nApplicant\u2019s trustworthiness. I find against Applicant on Guideline E.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate the\nApplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s conduct and\nall the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative\nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nApplicant is 39 years old and presumed to be a mature, responsible adult.\nAlthough Applicant was young when he began using marijuana, he continued to use it\nwell into adulthood, stopping only 16 months ago at age 38. Nor was he a youth when\nhe provided false information to the government at 33 years of age, or when he falsified\nagain at 37. Moreover, Applicant\u2019s Response to the FORM reflects not remorse for\nbreaking the law over a period of approximately 20 years, but a desire to maintain his\nsecurity clearance. A fair and commonsense assessment of the available information\nbearing on Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance shows he has not satisfied the\ndoubts raised by his conduct. Because protection of the national interest is paramount\nin these determinations, such doubts must be resolved in favor of the government.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are as follows:\n\n7\nParagraph 1, Guideline H:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a. - 1.e.\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a. - 2.c.\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest\nto allow Applicant access to classified information. Applicant\u2019s request for a security\nclearance is denied.\nRITA C. O\u2019BRIEN\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On July 30, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing \nsecurity concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The action was taken \nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on August 20, 2009, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. On September 10, 2009, DOHA assigned the \nDecember 16, 2009\n\n \n \n \n \n2\ncase to me. On September 21, 2009, DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing, setting the \ncase for October 15, 2009. The case was heard as scheduled.  Department Counsel \noffered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 6 into evidence without objection. Applicant testified and \ncalled one witness. The record remained open until October 30, 2009, to give Applicant \nan opportunity to submit information. Applicant timely submitted three exhibits that I \nmarked as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through C and admitted into evidence. DOHA \nreceived the hearing transcript on October 24, 2009.                                                         \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer, Applicant admitted all of the allegations contained in Paragraph 1 \nof the SOR. Those admissions are set forth herein. \n \n \nApplicant is 37 years old and married for 17 years. They have three children, \nages 17, 15, and 7. He has an 18-year old daughter from a previous relationship, whom \nhe no longer supports. He has worked at various jobs during and since completing high \nschool. From May 2002 to June 2008, he was a business system analyst for a bank. In \nJune 2008, he began a position as a quality assurance engineer with a federal \ncontractor. In his first yearly performance evaluation, he received an outstanding over-\nall rating from his supervisor. (AE C.) \n \n \nBeginning in 2004, Applicant and his family suffered several personal losses. His \nbrother died in March 2004. His father died in September 2004. His oldest brother died \nin October 2005, and his nephew died in January 2007. In January 2008, his father-in-\nlaw died. Over the course of those four years, he financially assisted his parents and \nfamily. As a consequence, he extinguished $1,100 of his savings, withdrew money from \nhis retirement funds, and began accumulating debt because he could not afford to \nassist with other family member\u2019s bills and pay his immediate family\u2019s obligations. (Tr. \n54, 57.)   \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s annual income for 2004 was about $38,000. In 2005 and 2006, he \nearned $40,000. In 2007, he earned $41,000. In 2008, his salary increased to $48,000. \nFrom 2004 until 2008, he estimated that he spent well over $15,000 of his income on \nfuneral and living expenses for other family members. (Tr. 60-63.) Applicant testified \nthat in July 2008, he contacted a bankruptcy attorney about filing a Chapter 13 petition \nin order to resolve his delinquent debts. The attorney told him that he did not earn \nenough money to establish a repayment plan as required under a Chapter 13. \n \n \nIn August 2008, Applicant completed an e-QIP and disclosed that he had \ndelinquent debts. In October 2008, a government investigator interviewed him about his \ndebts and gave him a copy of his September 2008 credit bureau report (CBR). (GE 3, \n4.) In his May 2009 response to government Interrogatories, he acknowledged that he \nowed 15 delinquent debts and explained in a letter that the debts were the result of \nfamily deaths and additional financial burdens that he assumed.  (GE 5) \n \n \n  \n\n \n \n \n \n3\n \n \nIn May 2009, he contacted another bankruptcy lawyer who confirmed the \nprevious attorney\u2019s conclusion and recommended that he file a Chapter 7 bankruptcy. \n(GE 5 at 23; AE B.) In order to file a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition, the lawyer requires a \nretainer of $1,386. Applicant has sent the lawyer $600, in $50 increments, and intends \nto complete the payments in the next couple months. (Tr. 34.) In the interim, the lawyer \nadvised him not to pay any of his delinquent debts because they will be included in the \nbankruptcy. (Tr. 40.) He will continue paying his mortgage. (Tr. 36, 40.) He has not \nobtained credit counseling to date, but will participate in it as part of the bankruptcy \nproceeding. (Tr.38.) \n \n \nThe July 2009 SOR alleged that Applicant accumulated approximately $40,000 in \ndelinquent debts owed to 15 creditors. The accounts underlying the debts were opened \nbetween April 2005 and June 2007, and became delinquent between March 2007 and \nMarch 2009. Applicant acknowledged that none of them are paid or resolved. Of that \ndebt, Applicant owes $13,193 (\u00b6 1.l) on a 2006 automobile repossession. (Tr. 48.) The \n$7,294 debt listed in \u00b6 1.m, and the $6,256 debt listed in \u00b6 1.n, are related to funeral \nexpenses for his father and brother. (Tr. 49-50.) The remaining debt is attributable to \nitems he purchased for his immediate family and for other family members. \n \n  \nAccording to his October 2009 budget, Applicant\u2019s net monthly income is $4,204, \nand his expenses are $3,840, leaving him a remainder of $363 at the end of the month \nto cover any other expenses. Included in his expenses are his mortgage, car loan, an \northodontic payment, and two other loans, one of which is related to the repayment of \nmonies he withdrew from his 401(k). (Tr. 57.) Applicant had good credit until late 2006 \nwhen he started to fall behind in his financial obligations as a result of the family \nproblems.1 He emphasized that he was able to purchase his first house in November \n2004 and his second home in September 2006.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife testified. She is carefully monitoring and managing the family \nfinances. In order to reduce their expenses, she negotiated with their bank a reduction \nof their monthly mortgage payment. (Tr. 60-61.) They are no longer providing support to \nfamily members.  \n \n \nApplicant understands \u201cwhat it is to be responsible, it\u2019s just that sometimes the \nevents are out of your control.\u201d (Tr. 69.) Although he has reduced his financial \nassistance to his family, he does believe that it is important to help with one\u2019s family \nproblems. (Id.) He is regaining control of his finances and will resolve the delinquent \ndebts when the Chapter 7 bankruptcy is completed.  \n \n \n \n \n                                            \n1According to the September 2008 credit bureau report, Applicant was paying \nmany of his debts on time and had closed several accounts after paying them. (GE 3)  \n\n \n \n \n \n4\nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nAccording to Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to \nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \n\u201capplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \n \n A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nan applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d  \n \n \n \n  \n\n \n \n \n \n5\nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \nAG \u00b6 19 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debt began accumulating between March 2007 and \nMarch 2009. He has been unable to manage or resolve his debts to date. The \nevidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions. \nAfter the government produced substantial evidence of those disqualifications, \nthe burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove a mitigating condition. \nAG \u00b6 20 provides three conditions that could mitigate security concerns raised under \nthis guideline: \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nand \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; and \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant\u2019s debts began accumulating March 2007 and continued into March \n2009, as a consequence of five deaths in the family and his family\u2019s need for financial \n\n \n \n \n \n6\nassistance. Those circumstances were outside of his control. In July 2008, he sought \nlegal advice for help in establishing a repayment plan for the debts. Because he did not \nearn sufficient income to file a Chapter 13 bankruptcy, he was advised to file a Chapter \n7 bankruptcy. For the next year, he did not take any other action to responsibly manage \nor address his debts as they were accumulating; I find AG \u00b6 20(b) has limited \napplication in this case.  \n \nApplicant has not obtained credit counseling and there are no clear indications \nthat his delinquent debts are being resolved or paid. AG \u00b6 20(c) cannot apply. In May \n2007, he retained a bankruptcy attorney to file a Chapter 7 bankruptcy as soon as he \ncompletes payments on a retainer. He admitted that he has not attempted to resolve or \npay any of the debts since learning of the government\u2019s concerns in October 2008, \nother than to decide to file bankruptcy in the future. AG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a). They include the following:  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must include an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  Applicant is a 37-year-old married \nman, who began working for a federal contractor in June 2008. His supervisor gave him \nan outstanding performance rating for his first annual review. From 2004 until January \n2008, he lost five family members. Out of a sense of family responsibility, he assumed \nfuneral and living expenses for other family members, resulting in significant financial \nobligations that he could not afford and did not manage. After consulting an attorney in \nJuly 2008 and learning that his budget was insufficient to accommodate a Chapter 13 \nbankruptcy, he did not take any action to resolve or pay his debts (even the small debt \nof $134 alleged in \u00b6 1.a) until May 2009 when he spoke to another lawyer. He has now \ndecided to file a Chapter 7 bankruptcy and discharge $40,000 of delinquent debts. He \n\n \n \n \n \n7\nbegan making payments on a retainer to a lawyer, which must be paid in order to initiate \nthe proceeding.  \n \nWhile I appreciate Applicant\u2019s loyalty and sense of responsibility to his family, I \nhave concerns about his decision to provide a large amount of financial support that he \ncould not afford and which he now intends to discharge through a bankruptcy. I am \naware that up to late 2006, he had a good credit rating and is managing his current \nfinancial obligations. However, it is too early at this time to determine that he has \nresponsibly resolved his delinquent debts or established a consistent track record of \npaying his financial obligations.

Coppins, Esquire \n \n \n \n \n______________ \n \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nDAM, Shari, Administrative Judge: \n \n \nBased upon a review of the record as a whole, eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is granted. \n \nHistory of Case \n \nOn April 13, 2008, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP). On August 28, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline B, Foreign Influence. The action was taken under Executive \nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), \nas amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and \nthe revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December \n29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after \nSeptember 1, 2006.  \n  \nFebruary 24, 2010\n\n \n \n \n \n2\n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on or about October 13, 2009, and \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge. DOHA assigned the case to me on \nDecember 10, 2009, and issued a Notice of Hearing setting the hearing for January 7, \n2010. On that date, the government offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 3 into \nevidence without objection. Applicant testified and offered Applicant Exhibits (AE) A \nthrough Q into evidence without objection. The record remained open until January 22, \n2010, to give Applicant an opportunity to submit copies of some of his exhibits, which he \ntimely did. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on January 19, 2010.  \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice \nof certain facts relating to Iraq. The request and the attached documents pertinent to \nIraq are included in the record as Hearing Exhibits (HE) I through VI (Tr. 17-20). \nApplicant did not object to my consideration of those Hearing Exhibits. The facts \nadministratively noticed are limited to matters of general knowledge, and matters \npertinent to Iraq, and not subject to reasonable dispute. The facts administratively \nnoticed are set out in the Findings of Fact, below.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations contained in \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.c of the SOR.   \n \n \nApplicant is 59 years old. He was born in southern Iraq. He attended high school \nand undergraduate college there. In June 1972, he received a medical degree with a \nradiology specialty and then completed two years of mandatory military service in May \n1975. He subsequently practiced medicine in a public clinic in the morning and worked \nat his private clinic in the afternoon. (Tr. 35, 79.)  \n \n \nIn 1995, Applicant, his wife, and three children, now ages 30, 27, and 22, fled \nIraq to escape Saddam Hussein\u2019s regime and potential interrogation. (Tr. 30.) They \nlived in Country One for four years before receiving refugee status and arriving in the \nUnited States in 1999. (Tr. 81.) In May 2006, he became a naturalized U.S. citizen. His \nwife became a naturalized U.S. citizen in December 2005. His son and one daughter \nbecame U.S. citizens in February 2006, and the other daughter in December 2007. Two \nof his children have graduated from U.S. universities and his other child is completing \nher degree. His wife does not work outside of the home. Applicant speaks English and \nArabic. None of his family members have returned to Iraq. (Tr. 99.) \n \n \nAfter arriving in the United States in 1999, Applicant has held various positions. \nHe has worked as a case worker, an interpreter, and a director of a youth project. He \nwas unemployed from September 2001 until December 2002, while he attended college \nfull-time and pursued a degree as a medical sonographer. (GE 1.) He subsequently \n\n \n \n \n \n3\nbecame licensed and worked in hospitals from January 2003 to March 2007, when he \nobtained a position with a defense contractor. (GE 1.)  \n \n \nBoth of Applicant\u2019s parents were born and raised in Iraq. They are deceased. His \nfather owned a large shoe business before his death. His mother was a homemaker. \n(Tr. 84; 96.) \n \n \nApplicant is one of six children, all born in Iraq. Applicant has one brother and \nfour sisters, all of whom are citizens and residents of Iraq. Applicant\u2019s brother is a high \nschool teacher for a public school. One of Applicant\u2019s sisters is a pharmacy professor at \nan Iraqi university. (Tr. 35.) Another sister works as a bookkeeper for an oil company. \n(Tr. 36.) His third sister is a soil physicist. (Id.) His fourth sister is a clerk for a company \nthat builds public projects. (Tr. 37.) Three of his brothers-in-laws are deceased; the \nother brother-in-law is a retired civil engineer. (Tr. 89.) All of his siblings have some \nconnection to the Iraqi government because it is the primary employer for all citizens. \nNone of the agencies or institutions that employ his siblings is involved with public \npolicy. (Tr. 86.) \n \n \nApplicant did not have any communication with his siblings after he left Iraq in \n1995 until it was liberated in 2003. At that time, he telephoned his siblings to inform \nthem that he was alive and living in the United States. (Tr. 33; 37; 85.) From 2003 to \n2007, he had limited telephone contact with them because Iraq had poor \ncommunication technology. Since starting his position in May 2007, he calls his brother \nand one sister every two to three months. (Tr. 86.) He has not spoken to the other two \nsisters for more than a year. (Tr. 86.) His siblings do not know that he works in Iraq. (Tr. \n85.) He has not seen any of them since he left in 1995. (Tr. 85.) \n \n \nIn May 2007, Applicant returned to Iraq for the first time since leaving the country \nin 1995. He was deployed as a bilingual/bicultural advisor to the U.S. troops, using his \nmedical background and language skills in the base\u2019s hospital. (Tr. 47.) While working \nthere, he does not use his birth name, but is referred to as Dr. [x] for security reasons. \nHe does not want anyone knowing his real name \u201cbecause this is very dangerous for \nmy siblings, for my family in Iraq.\u201d (Tr. 39.) He does not want his family targeted by \nterrorists. (Id.) He has worked there for the past two-and-a-half years and returns home \nevery four to six months for two week intervals. (Tr. 99.) He held an interim clearance \nfor a period of time. (Tr. 8.) \n \n \nIn 1992, Applicant purchased a vacant piece of property located in a village \noutside an Iraqi city\u2019s limits for $30,000. Due to his ethnicity, he was not permitted to \nown property within the city boundaries. (Tr. 42-44.) After he fled the country, he \nassumed the property was confiscated by the government. (Tr. 43.) While in Iraq in \n2007, he learned that the property is vacant. It is now worth $10,000 or less. (Tr. 44.) \nHe has not visited the property while living in Iraq because he is not permitted to leave \nthe base. (Tr. 45.). He does not know what to do about the property. He would like to \nsell it, but does not believe he will be able to do so. He is not particularly concerned \nabout it. (Tr. 90-91.) He has no other financial interests in Iraq. (Tr. 92.) \n\n \n \n \n \n4\n \n \nApplicant owns two houses in the United States, one purchased for $206,000 \nand another recently purchased for $230,000. (Tr. 90-91.) There is no derogatory \ninformation concerning his police or financial records. He has never been fired from a \njob. He has never been arrested. He has never used illegal drugs or been involved in an \nalcohol-related incident. (GE 1.) There is no evidence in the record that Applicant \nbreached any security policies or procedures while holding an interim security clearance \nin Iraq.  \n \n \nApplicant submitted five letters, seven Certificates of Appreciation, and several \nperformance evaluations, attesting to his capabilities and contributions in providing \nhealth support services for Operation Iraqi Freedom. Applicant\u2019s Commanding Officer \nfrom October 2007 to February 2008 wrote, \u201cOf all the people that I have worked with, \n[Applicant] possesses some of the highest values, morals, and integrity that I have ever \nencountered in a human being.\u201d (AE I.) The Program Manager for the base\u2019s operation \nsupport and services stated, \u201cPhysicians like [Applicant] serve to bridge the gap \nbetween the American Doctors and the Iraqi patients utilizing both medical and cultural \nexperiences; making the management, follow-up and movement of those Iraqi patients \neasier and safer.\u201d (AE H.) A lieutenant colonel who worked with Applicant from January \nto July 2009, as the Chief of the Medical Staff, commented that Applicant \u201cis a truly \nremarkable individual who is very dedicated to the United States and the mission of the \nDepartment of Defense in Iraq.\u201d (AE J.) A major and a colonel signed a letter of \nrecommendation for Applicant, stating that Applicant \u201chas demonstrated the core values \nthat the Air Force holds in the highest regard: Integrity First, Service before Self and \nExcellence in All Things.\u201d (AE K.) An administrator for the Dental Group at the base, a \nlieutenant colonel, recommends that Applicant receive a security clearance. She worked \nwith him from January through May 2008. \u201cI would be quite comfortable, putting my life \nin his hands if a situation were to require such measures . . .  I wish we had more \npeople like [Applicant] who would be willing to serve.\u201d (AE P.) All of Applicant\u2019s \nperformance evaluations predominantly rate him as \u201cExceeds Requirements.\u201d (AE D.) \n \n \nApplicant credibly and sincerely asserted pride in his U.S. citizenship at the \nhearing. He is very dedicated and enthusiastic about his ability to serve as a cultural \nadvisor to the U.S. military in an area that he described as \u201cthe most targeted base, \nAmerican base in Iraq.\u201d (Tr. 45; 98.)  \n \nIraq \nI take administrative notice of the following facts: In 2003, The United States led \na coalition to remove Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq. After free elections, Iraq\u2019s \nnew government took office. Despite the elections and new government, Iraq remains \nengulfed in violence, perpetrated by Al Qaeda terrorists and other insurgents. \nNumerous attacks and kidnappings have targeted the U.S. Armed Forces, contractors, \nand other civilians, as well as Iraqis. Even with aggressive governmental action against \nterrorists, the threat of terrorism in Iraq remains high. Terrorist groups conduct \nintelligence activities as effectively as state intelligence services. (HE I, V, VI.) \n\n \n \n \n \n5\nI also take administrative notice of the fact that the northern area of Iraq, \noccupied by the Kurdish people, has had a functioning democratic form of government \nfor approximately ten years. It is more stable, appreciative of the support of the United \nStates, and more friendly to the presence of the United States forces than other parts of \nIraq. (HE I, III.) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n2(b) and 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nAccording to Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to \nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \n\u201capplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, \nand has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance \ndecision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \n\n \n \n \n \n6\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for foreign influence is set out in \nAG & 6:       \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign county in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism. \n \nAG \u00b6 7 describes nine conditions that could raise a security concern, three of \nwhich may be disqualifying in this case: \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;1  \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information; and \n \n(e) a substantial business, financial, or property interest in a foreign \ncountry, or in any foreign-owned or foreign-operated business, which \ncould subject the individual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or \nexploitation. \n                                            \n1 The mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, as a matter of \nlaw, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in a foreign country and an \napplicant has contacts with that relative, this factor alone is sufficient to create the potential for foreign \ninfluence and could potentially result in the compromise of classified information. See ISCR Case No. 03-\n02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001). \n \n\n \n \n \n \n7\nApplicant has contact and connections with his brother and four sisters, who are \nresidents and citizens of Iraq. He acknowledged that these relationships potentially \ncreate a heightened risk of foreign pressure or attempted exploitation because terrorists \nin Iraq seek intelligence that is hostile to the U. S. interests. Applicant\u2019s relationship with \nhis siblings also creates a potential conflict of interest between Applicant\u2019s \u201cobligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and [his] desire to help\u201d his family living in \nIraq. He also owns a piece of property in Iraq, estimated to be valued at $10,000. The \nevidence is sufficient to raise these three potentially disqualifying conditions.  \n  \n  \nAfter the government produced substantial evidence of those disqualifying \nconditions, the burden shifted to Applicant to rebut and prove mitigation. Four Foreign \nInfluence mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 are potentially applicable to the \ndisqualifying conditions based on the facts: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.;   \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest;  \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; and \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterest is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not be \nused effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n \nIn the event terrorists would learn of Applicant\u2019s identity and presence in Iraq, his \nsiblings could be placed in positions that would force him to choose between them and \nU.S. interests. However, the possibility of that conflict occurring is diminished by several \nfactors: Applicant has limited communication with his five siblings; he does not disclose \nhis last name at work; he does not visit them; and they do not know that he works in \nIraq.  Hence, AG \u00b6 8(a) has some application.   \n \nApplicant established the application of AG \u00b6 8(b). Based on his relationship and \ndepth of loyalty to the U.S., he can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in \nfavor of the U.S. interest. He and his immediate family members have lived in the \nUnited States since 1999. He attended school here. He worked at various jobs for \n\n \n \n \n \n8\nseven years before obtaining his current position. His wife and three children are \nnaturalized U.S. citizens, residing here. He owns substantial property in the United \nStates. In contrast, his financial interests in Iraq are negligible. There is no evidence that \nhe has connections or contact with people living in Iraq other than his five family \nmembers. He expressed a strong sense of loyalty to the United States and zeal for his \njob. His supervisors, who have worked in close contact with him in a combat zone, \nconsider him to be an ethical and dedicated man, who is a valuable asset to the U.S. \nWar on Terror. \n \nAG \u00b6 8(c) has some application to the security concerns raised, as Applicant\u2019s \ncontacts with his five siblings are generally infrequent and casual. He telephones his \ntwo siblings every two or three months. He speaks to his other three siblings less \nfrequently. He has not seen any of them since 1995.  \n \nIn 1992, Applicant purchased a piece of vacant property that now has an \nestimated value of $10,000. That amount of money is insignificant compared to his U.S. \nproperties that total over $400,000. He believed for many years that the Iraqi property \nwas confiscated by the government. Other than being aware that he still has property \nrights, given his statement that he is not concerned about the vacant parcel, it is unlikely \nthat any threat to confiscate the land would cause him concern or conflict. AG \u00b6 8(f) is \napplicable.   \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility \nfor a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. The Appeal Board \nrequires the whole-person analysis address \u201cevidence of an applicant\u2019s personal \nloyalties; the nature and extent of an applicant\u2019s family\u2019s ties to the U.S. relative to his \n[or her] ties to a foreign country; his or her social ties within the U.S.; and many others \nraised by the facts of a given case.\u201d ISCR Case No. 04-00540 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 5, \n2007).   \n\n \n \n \n \n9\n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Although this case pertains to \nGuideline B, the security concerns do not arise from any questionable conduct by \nApplicant, but rather circumstances that warrant further analysis. First, there is a \nsignificant risk of terrorism and various human rights abuses in Iraq. More importantly \nfor security purposes, terrorists in Iraq are hostile to the United States and actively seek \nclassified information. Terrorists, and even friendly governments, could attempt to use \nApplicant\u2019s siblings to obtain such information. Second, he had numerous connections \nto Iraq before he immigrated to the United States in 1999. Following his birth, he spent \nhis formative years there. He was educated at an Iraqi university and practiced \nmedicine for twenty years in both public and private clinics. Third, five siblings remain \nresidents and citizens of Iraq. Fourth, he maintains some contact with these family \nmembers and carefully monitors disclosure of his last name to provide security for them.  \n \nSubstantial mitigating evidence weighs in favor of granting Applicant a security \nclearance. He is a mature person, who has lived in the United States for 11 years, and \nhas been a naturalized citizen since 2006. His spouse has been living in the United \nStates since 1999 and is also a naturalized citizen, as are his three Iraqi-born children, \nnow adults. He owns property here, worth more than $400,000. In his current \nemployment, he provides vital and direct support to the U.S. Armed Forces as a cultural \nand medical advisor. After leaving Iraq in 1995, he did not return until May 2007, when \nhe was deployed there. His ties to the United States are much stronger than his ties to \nfamily members living in Iraq. There is no evidence that he has ever taken any action \nthat could cause potential harm to the United States. He takes his loyalty to the United \nStates seriously. He has worked diligently for a defense contractor for several years in \nan important capacity. He jeopardizes his physical safety while working in Iraq. His \nsupervisors assess him as loyal, trustworthy, conscientious, and responsible, giving him \nexcellent evaluations and praising his dedication to the cause of freedom in Iraq. Since \nreturning to Iraq in 2007 with the U.S. military, he has not had any physical contact with \nhis family. There is no derogatory information about him in the record.  \n \nApplicant has held an interim security clearance during his work with the U.S. \nArmed Forces without any indication that he breached security policies or procedures. \nWhile that fact is not normally to be considered a factor in granting a clearance, the \nAppeal Board noted in ISCR Case No. 05-03846 (App. Bd. Nov.14, 2006) as follows: \n \nAs a general rule, Judges are not required to assign an applicant\u2019s prior \nhistory of complying with security procedures and regulations significant \nprobative value for purposes of refuting, mitigating, or extenuating the \nsecurity concerns raised by the applicant\u2019s more immediate disqualifying \nconduct or circumstances. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-03357 at 4 (App. \nBd. Dec. 13, 2005); ISCR Case No. 02-10113 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, \n2005); ISCR Case No. 03-10955 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 30, 2006). \nHowever, the Board has recognized an exception to that general rule in \nGuideline B cases, where the applicant has established by credible, \n\n \n \n \n \n10\nindependent evidence that his compliance with security procedures and \nregulations occurred in the context of dangerous, high-risk circumstances \nin which the applicant had made a significant contribution to the national \nsecurity. See, e.g. ISCR Case No. 04-12363 at 2 (App. Bd. July 14, 2006). \nThe presence of such circumstances can give credibility to an applicant\u2019s \nassertion that he can be relied upon to recognize, resist, and report a \nforeign power\u2019s attempts at coercion or exploitation. \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all facts and \ncircumstances in the context of the whole-person, I conclude Applicant mitigated the \nsecurity concerns pertaining to foreign influence.2 Overall, the record evidence leaves \nme without questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the foreign influence \nsecurity concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.c:   For Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n                                           \n     \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nSHARI DAM \nAdministrative Judge \n                                            \n2 I conclude that the whole-person analysis weighs heavily toward approval of his security clearance. \nAssuming a higher authority reviewing this decision determines the mitigating conditions articulated under \nAG \u00b6 8 do not apply and severs any consideration of them, I conclude the whole-person analysis standing \nalone is sufficient to support approval of a security clearance in this case. \n",

On July 13, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns \nunder Guideline J, Criminal Misconduct and, Guideline G, Alcohol Consumption. The \naction was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn August 7, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on September 24, \n2009. The case was assigned to me on September 28, 2009. On October 15, 2009, a \nNotice of Hearing was issued scheduling the hearing for November 3, 2009. The \nhearing was held as scheduled. The government offered eight exhibits which were \nadmitted as Government Exhibits (Gov) 1 - 8 without objection. Applicant testified, and \noffered no exhibits. The transcript was received on November 10, 2009. Based upon a \nJanuary 14, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n \nreview of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \n \nProcedural Issue \n \n \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR pursuant to \u00b6 \nE3.1.17 of the Directive in order to conform with the evidence. Applicant had no \nobjection. The SOR was amended to read as follows: \n \n1.e.  You were arrested on or about September 30, 2009, in the District of  \nColombia and charged with Driving Under the Influence. Your case \nremains pending as of November 3, 2009.  \n \n \n2.a.  Between 1996 and 2006, you were arrested for four alcohol-related \ncharges as set forth in subparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.e above.  \n \n \nThe beginning phrase of SOR \u00b6 2.b was changed from \u201cDuring the fall of the \n2007..\u201d to \u201cSome time prior to May 2001\u2026\u201d  \n  \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admits all of the SOR allegations.   \n \nApplicant is a 37-year-old financial analyst with a Department of Defense \ncontractor who seeks a security clearance.  He has been employed with his company \nsince September 2008. From June 1992 to May 2001, Applicant served on active duty \nin the United States Army. He received a medical discharge. He separated as an E-5 \nwith an honorable discharge. He previously held a security clearance during his active \nduty service. He has a bachelor\u2019s degree in business administration and currently takes \ngraduate school classes. He is single and has no children. He pays approximately $300 \na month towards his niece\u2019s private school tuition. (Tr at 5-8, 30-32; Gov 1; Gov 3)   \n \nThe SOR alleges and Applicant admits that he was arrested and charged with \noffenses related to driving while intoxicated on four occasions between1996 and 2005.  \n \nIn 1996, Applicant was arrested and charged with Driving Under the Influence of \nAlcohol. He was found guilty, fined $700, and placed on one year probation. (Tr at 33; \nGov 2 at 11; Gov 4; Gov 7 at 2)  \n \nOn July 24, 1999, Applicant was arrested and charged with Driving Under the \nInfluence of Alcohol, Refusal, Operating After Suspension, Failure to Maintain Control, \nand Open Container of Alcohol within a Motor Vehicle.  After a night of socializing at the \nclub with friends, he was stopped by the military police because of his erratic driving on \nbase. He failed a series of field sobriety tests. He appeared before the U.S. Magistrate \nand was found guilty of all the charges with the exception of Operating After \nSuspension. On April 4, 2000, he was sentenced to three years supervised probation \n\n \n3 \n \n \nwith special conditions. He was ordered to enter and complete ASAP (alcohol \nawareness counseling), submit to substance abuse testing and treatment, and his \nlicense was restricted. (Tr at 37-39; Gov 2 at 11; Gov 5; Gov 8 at 8- 13) On April, 2001, \nAppellant\u2019s probation was revoked as a result of the February 18, 2001 Driving While \nIntoxicated and Operating After Suspension arrest described in the below paragraph. \nHe served 45 days in jail, his probation was extended one year, and his license was \nsuspended for one year. (Gov 8 at 12-13)   \n \nOn February 18, 2001, Applicant was arrested and charged with Driving While \nIntoxicated, Second Offense, and Operating After Suspension. The military police were \nconducting 100% identification checks at the base gate. They detected a strong odor of \nalcohol on Applicant\u2019s breath when he drove up to the base gate. He was given field \nsobriety tests. He performed poorly on the tests. Applicant\u2019s blood alcohol content test  \nregistered 0.17%.  On May 15, 2001, he appeared before the U.S. Magistrate, pled and \nwas found guilty of the offenses. On June 12, 2001, he was sentenced to 90 days in jail, \none year supervised probation and his driving privileges were suspended for one year. \nHe was given three years probation for the Operation After Suspension charge. He was \nalso sentenced to serve 30 days in jail and ordered to complete an ASAP program. (Tr \nat 40-42; Gov 2 at 11-12; Gov 6; Gov 7 at 3; Gov 8 at 5-7)   \n \nOn November 12, 2005, Applicant was arrested and charged with DWI, 3rd \nOffense, a felony and Refusal to provide a Blood/Breath Test. On September 22, 2006, \nhe pled guilty to DWI, 3rd Offense, a felony. He was sentenced to five years in the \npenitentiary, with four years, nine months suspended, his driver\u2019s license was \nsuspended for 91 years, he was ordered to pay $1,505 in fines and court costs and \nplaced on five years supervised probation.  The Refusal to provide a Blood/Breath test \ncharge was nolle prossed. (Tr at 43-47; Gov 2 at 12; Gov 7 at 4; Gov 8 at 1-4)  \n \nApplicant is on probation until July 2011. He is required to check in with his \nprobation officer once a week and is tested for drugs and alcohol on a weekly basis. He \nclaims he has no restrictions on his driver\u2019s license even though the court records \nindicate his driver\u2019s license was suspended for 91 years.  He is required to abstain from \nalcohol as part of the terms of his probation. (Tr at 45-47; Gov 2 at 12) \n \nDuring an October 31, 2008, interview conducted pursuant to his background \ninvestigation, Applicant admitted that his use of alcohol has had an impact on his ability \nto find a job and his relationships with his friends and family members. He began \ndrinking at age 19. He drank on weekends. He occasionally drank alone. He would drink \napproximately a fifth of whiskey over the weekend.  (Gov 2 at 12) \n \nIn the late 1990s, Applicant attended a 30-day outpatient alcohol treatment \nprogram at a military treatment facility.  He was diagnosed as alcohol dependent. He \nsuccessfully completed the program and was advised to quit drinking alcohol. (Tr at 47-\n49; Gov 2 at 12-13)     \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted to all of the allegations and accepts \nresponsibility for his past careless behavior.  He suffers from a chronic illness that may \nbecome terminal.  While on active duty in the Army, he was diagnosed with depression \nand was medically discharged. He believes he used alcohol as a means of self-\nmedicating.  He is doing his best to show that he is a socially responsible citizen. He \nbelieves that he will learn from his history of alcohol abuse. He has set and maintained \na new standard of behavior that does not include alcohol or breaking any laws. He does \nnot want depression or alcohol to control him anymore. He is now worthy of holding a \nsecurity clearance. (Answer to SOR, dated August 7, 2009) \n \nDuring the hearing, Applicant testified that he is fighting for his life and recently \naccepted he is an alcoholic and addict. He looks at alcoholism as a disease that can be \ntreated. He attends Alcoholics Anonymous meetings on a regular basis and has a \ndifferent social network in order to remain clean and sober. (Tr at 26-28) \n \nOn September 30, 2009, Applicant was arrested and charged with Driving While \nUnder the Influence. He was stopped by the police for having no headlights on. The \npolice officer smelled alcohol and administered a field sobriety test which Applicant \nfailed. Applicant was taken to jail. When placed in the holding cell, he tried to hang \nhimself with a sock. He woke up in the hospital. He initially claimed that he was not \ndrinking on the night he was arrested. He later admitted that he drank a glass of wine \nearlier in the day. He admits he was aware that he was required to abstain from alcohol \nas part of his probation. His next court date was November 25, 2009. (Tr at 51-54, 68) \n \nWhen questioned, Applicant admitted that he had drank alcohol to intoxication on \nat least six occasions after his DWI arrest in 2005. (Tr at 55) \n \nOn October 4, 2009, Applicant started to attend AA meetings. He did not \nembrace the concept of AA when he attended AA meetings before. He claims to have \nattended 60 AA meetings since October 4, 2009. He also attends outpatient treatment \nat the Veteran\u2019s Administration (VA) on a daily basis. The VA is providing treatment for \nhis depression. He takes an anti-depressant and antabuse. He admits it is difficult for \nhim to accept that he has a problem. (Tr at 57-58, 63-65)  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n\n \n5 \n \n \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nCriminal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern raised under the criminal conduct guideline is set forth in \u00b6 \n30 of the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines: \n \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \n \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability \n \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \nThere are several Criminal Conduct Disqualifying Conditions (CC DC) which \napply to Applicant\u2019s case, CC DC \u00b6 31(a) (a single serious crime or multiple lesser \noffenses) and CC DC \u00b6 31(c) (allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted). Between \n\n \n6 \n \n \n1996 and 2005, Applicant was arrested and convicted for drunk driving offenses on four \noccasions.  Drunk driving is a serious offense. He was charged with a felony offense in \nrelation to his fourth arrest for DWI in March 2005.  He had a fifth DWI arrest on \nSeptember 30, 2009 - less than two months after responding to the SOR.   \n \nCC DC \u00b6 31(d) (individual is currently on parole or probation) and CC DC \u00b6 31(e) \n(violation of parole or probation, or failure to complete a court-ordered mandated \nrehabilitation program) apply. Applicant is serving probation until July 2011 for his fourth \nDWI conviction.  Part of the condition of his probation is to abstain from alcohol. He \nadmits that he drank alcohol on several occasions while on probation. He was arrested \nfor his fifth DWI on September 30, 2009. While the charges were pending at the time of \nApplicant\u2019s hearing, his decision to drink alcohol and drive was a violation of his \nprobation. \n \nThe government produced substantial evidence by way of exhibits and testimony \nto raise CC DC \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and 31(c). The burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence \nto rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns (Directive \u00b6E3.1.15). An \napplicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving \nit never shifts to the government (See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. \nSeptember 22, 2005.)   \n \nThe following Criminal Conduct Mitigating Conditions (CC MC) are relevant to \nApplicant\u2019s case: \n \nCC MC \u00b6 32(a) (so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior \nhappened, or it happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does \nnot cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) does not \napply. Applicant was arrested for DWI for the fifth time on September 30, 2009. He \ncontinued to drink and drive even though he was required to abstain from alcohol as \npart of his probation and his license was suspended for 91 years. He is on probation \nuntil July 2011. He chose to drink and drive even though he was aware that his past \nalcohol issues raised concerns about his ability to hold a security clearance. While \nApplicant is struggling with his alcohol issues, not enough time has passed to conclude \nApplicant\u2019s past DWI offenses are no longer an issue.  \n \nCC MC \u00b6 33(d) (there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not \nlimited to the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or constructive \ncommunity involvement) does not apply for the reasons mentioned above.  \n \nThe Criminal Conduct concern is not mitigated. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Alcohol Consumption is set out \nin AG & 21:       \n \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.  \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. The following disqualifying conditions are relevant to Applicant\u2019s case: \n \nAlcohol Consumption Disqualifying Condition (AC DC) \u00b6 22(a) (alcohol-related \nincidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence, fighting, child or \nspouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of \nwhether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent) applies. \nApplicant has been arrested and charged with Driving While Under the Influence on five \noccasions. His most recent DWI arrest occurred about a month prior to his security \nclearance hearing while he was on probation for his fourth drunk driving offense.  \n \nAC DC &22(c) (habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the person is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or \nalcohol dependent) applies. Applicant\u2019s history of DWI arrests indicates that Applicant \ndrinks to the point of impaired judgment. When he attended treatment for alcohol abuse \nin the late 1990s while in the military, he was diagnosed as alcohol dependent. The \ncredentials of the person providing the diagnosis are unknown. No treatment records \nare included in the record evidence. \n \nAC DC \u00b6 22(g) (failure to follow any court order regarding alcohol education, \nevaluation, treatment, or abstinence) applies. The terms of Applicant\u2019s current probation \nrequire him to abstain from alcohol.  He drank alcohol on several occasions while on \nprobation. He admits that he drank to intoxication on six occasions while on probation. \nHis failure to follow the terms of his probation resulted in his most recent arrest for DWI \non September 30, 2009.  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from alcohol consumption. \n \nAlcohol Consumption Mitigating Condition (AC MC) \u00b6 23(a) (so much time has \npassed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it happened under such unusual \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) does not apply. Applicant\u2019s history \nof alcohol abuse has resulted in five DWI arrests. He continued to drink and drive after \nhis fourth DWI conviction. He could not refrain from using alcohol even though he was \nprohibited from drinking alcohol under the terms of his probation. Applicant claims he \nnow attends AA meetings and has embraced the program. However, his past history of \n\n \n8 \n \n \nrepeated alcohol abuse casts doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment.    \n \n \nAC MC & 23(b) (the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of \nalcohol abuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem and has \nestablished a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or responsible use (if an \nalcohol abuser) does not apply. While Applicant acknowledges his alcoholism, he has \ndone so several times in the past but has been unable to maintain a period of \nabstinence. It is too soon to conclude Applicant has overcome his problems with \nalcohol.  \n \nApplicant did not mitigate the security concerns raised under alcohol \nconsumption. Guideline G is found against Applicant.  \n   \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s active duty \nservice in the United States Army, his medical condition, and his employment history \nwith the defense contractor. Applicant\u2019s history of DWI criminal offenses and his alcohol \nabuse raise serious issues about his ability to protect classified information. He was \nunable to maintain his sobriety while currently serving probation for his fourth DWI even \nthough a condition of his probation was that he abstain from alcohol. His recent DWI \narrest further reinforces that he has not been able to control his alcohol consumption. \nHe continues to exercise bad judgment by drinking and driving.  While Applicant claims \nthat he now attends AA meetings on a daily basis, it is too soon to conclude that he \ndemonstrated a track record of sobriety when considering his past history of alcohol \nabuse.  While Applicant is commended for taking steps to get his alcoholism under \n\n \n9 \n \n \ncontrol, it is too soon to conclude that he mitigated the concerns raised under criminal \nconduct and alcohol consumption. Guideline G, Alcohol Consumption, and Guideline J, \nCriminal Conduct, are found against Applicant.   \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline J:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n                                        \n   \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nERIN C. HOGAN \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact1 In Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, he admitted the conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a to 1.g, except he changed the year he began consuming alcohol from 1972 to 1977 (HE 3). He also explained the circumstances of the offenses and provided mitigating information (HE 3). His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 50 years old (Tr. 6).2 In 1997, he received a bachelor of science degree in computer information (Tr. 6-7). In 2004, he received a master\u2019s degree in business administration (Tr. 6-7). In 1977, he married his spouse (Tr. 7). His two children are ages 24 and 28 (Tr. 8). He held a Secret security clearance from 1990 to 1995 (Tr. 8). Applicant has not served in the military (GE 1). Alcohol consumption Applicant consumed alcohol, occasionally to intoxication, from about 1977 to August 2008 (Tr. 25; SOR \u00b6 1.a\u2014HE 2, 3). He began consuming alcohol when he was 18 (Tr. 25). In 1979, the police arrested Applicant for illegal possession of alcohol when he was 19 (SOR \u00b6 1.b\u2014HE 2, 3; GE 4 at 9-10). 1Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy.

Cervi, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n__________ \n \nDecision \n__________ \n \nHARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant received alcohol-related treatment in the early 1990s. In June 2008, the \npolice arrested Applicant for driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI), and he \nadmitted he was DUI. From July 2008 to September 2008, he received alcohol-related \ntreatment. In September 2008, his therapist diagnosed him as alcohol dependent. \nApplicant failed to fully comply with his therapist\u2019s recommendations. Applicant \nminimized his alcohol consumption. Applicant failed to mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom alcohol consumption. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn November 3, 2008, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) (SF 86) (Government Exhibit (GE) 1). On June 23, \n2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant, pursuant to Executive \nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, \n1960, as amended and modified; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended \nand modified; and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005.  \n \nFebruary 24, 2010\n\n \n2 \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nThe SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline G (alcohol consumption) \n(Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the \npreliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and \nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether Applicant\u2019s \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n \nOn July 16, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge (HE 3). On October 1, 2009, Department \nCounsel announced he was ready to proceed on his case. On October 8, 2009, DOHA \nassigned Applicant\u2019s case to me. On November 13, 2009, DOHA issued a hearing \nnotice (HE 1). On December 17, 2009, Applicant\u2019s hearing was held. At the hearing, \nDepartment Counsel offered five exhibits (GE 1-5) (Tr. 22-23), and Applicant offered \ntwo exhibits (Tr. 24; AE A-B). Applicant objected to the content of some therapy notes; \nhowever, the objection to admissibility was overruled with Applicant\u2019s comments going \nto the weight given the evidence (Tr. 23). Department Counsel did not object to my \nconsideration of AE A-B (Tr. 25). I admitted GE 1-5 (Tr. 23), and AE A-B (Tr. 25). \nAdditionally, I admitted the hearing notice, SOR, and response to the SOR (HE 1-3). On \nJanuary 4, 2010, I received the transcript. No post-hearing exhibits were received.   \n \nFindings of Fact1 \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, he admitted the conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a to 1.g, except he changed the year he began consuming alcohol from 1972 to 1977 \n(HE 3). He also explained the circumstances of the offenses and provided mitigating \ninformation (HE 3). His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a \ncomplete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of \nfact.   \n \n \nApplicant is 50 years old (Tr. 6).2 In 1997, he received a bachelor of science \ndegree in computer information (Tr. 6-7). In 2004, he received a master\u2019s degree in \nbusiness administration (Tr. 6-7). In 1977, he married his spouse (Tr. 7). His two \nchildren are ages 24 and 28 (Tr. 8). He held a Secret security clearance from 1990 to \n1995 (Tr. 8). Applicant has not served in the military (GE 1).  \n \nAlcohol consumption  \n \nApplicant consumed alcohol, occasionally to intoxication, from about 1977 to \nAugust 2008 (Tr. 25; SOR \u00b6 1.a\u2014HE 2, 3). He began consuming alcohol when he was \n18 (Tr. 25). In 1979, the police arrested Applicant for illegal possession of alcohol when \nhe was 19 (SOR \u00b6 1.b\u2014HE 2, 3; GE 4 at 9-10).  \n \n1Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits.  \n \n2 Applicant\u2019s SF 86 (GE 1) is the source for the facts in this paragraph, unless stated otherwise. \n \n\n \n3 \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nApplicant said that when he drank alcohol he typically drank about a half pint of \nrum to make him feel relaxed (Tr. 27). He gradually increased the frequency of his \nalcohol consumption from weekends to three or four times a week (Tr. 29). He rarely \ndrank alcohol outside of his home (Tr. 29). \n \nApplicant consumed a half pint of alcohol almost every day after work (Tr. 38-39). \nHe tried to abstain from alcohol consumption for thirty days and was unable to do so \n(Tr. 36-37). He decided to enroll himself into an outpatient alcohol treatment program \n(Tr. 37). From around 1991 to about 1993, he received alcohol therapy and treatment \n(SOR \u00b6 1.c\u2014HE 2, 3). He was diagnosed as an alcoholic (Tr. 40; GE 4 at 9). He \nreceived six weeks of intensive therapy, and then less-intensive therapy for the next six \nmonths (Tr. 40). At the conclusion of the therapy program, he thought the diagnosis was \nthat he was doing well; however, he was \u201cpretty sure there was a recommendation there \nto continue group\u201d therapy (Tr. 43). Applicant did not continue with group therapy \nbecause he believed he \u201chad things relatively under control\u201d (Tr. 43). He was able to \nmaintain sobriety for about six months (Tr. 44). He repeatedly promised himself that he \nwould stop consuming alcohol for years; however, he eventually resumed his alcohol \nconsumption (Tr. 44).  \n \nApplicant drank alcohol twice to four times per week (Tr. 45). On September 16, \n2007, he had a heart attack and barely survived (Tr. 18, 22; AE B at 1). His doctor \nrecommended that he stop his alcohol consumption (Tr. 46-47). Applicant recognized \nthat he needed to stop drinking alcohol if he wanted to live (Tr. 18, 22). He also began \nto have greater faith in God (Tr. 19, 22). He informed his employer that he did not want \nto work 70 to 80 hours a week anymore (Tr. 19, 22). He stopped consuming alcohol \nfrom September 16, 2007, until April 2008 (Tr. 47). \n \nIn April 2008, after a contentious meeting with management, Applicant \npurchased some rum and returned to consumption of alcohol after eight months of \nsobriety (Tr. 20, 22, 47-48). He consumed alcohol from April until June 2008 (Tr. 20, 22, \n48). On June 17, 2008, after \u201canother particularly ugly meeting\u201d Applicant resigned from \nhis employment (Tr. 20, 22, 48-51; AE B at 1). On June 22, 2008, he drove about 60 \nmiles to an out-of-state casino, gambled, and drank four rum and cokes (Tr. 51-56).3 On \nhis way home the police stopped him for failure to maintain his lane (GE 4 at 5).  He \nfailed a field sobriety test (Tr. 80-81). And he refused to consent to a breathalyzer test \n(Tr. 57, 81). The police arrested him for DUI (Tr. 20-22, 51-56; SOR \u00b6 1.d\u2014HE 2, 3; GE \n4 at 5).   \n \nThe court placed Applicant on a 12-month diversion program, which included \nalcohol-related counseling and a victim impact panel. He paid a $635 fine, and his \ndriver\u2019s license was revoked for one year (GE 5 at 5). He claimed he was caught for \nDUI the only time he ever drank alcohol and drove (Tr. 39; GE 4 at 9). He said he did \nnot go out after consuming alcohol (Tr. 83; GE 4 at 9). Applicant had 12 meetings with \nhis counselor from July to September 2008 (Tr. 73; GE 5). On July 1, 2008, his \ncounselor, who is a licensed clinical social worker, indicated he was receiving individual \n \n3Applicant also provided a statement indicating he drank \u201ca couple of drinks\u201d (AE B at 2).  \n\n \n4 \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \ntreatment for alcoholism (GE 5 at 1). His counselor recommended that Applicant \nparticipate in Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings and that he take Vivitrol (Tr. 57, 62, \n67-68; GE 5). Applicant did not like attending AA meetings, and declined to participate \nin AA (Tr. 59-60). He did not take Vivitrol even though his counselor said it was better \nthan Antabuse (Tr. 62, 67). His personal physician had little knowledge of Vivitrol (Tr. \n62). He chose to engage in church-related counseling, which he received from a friend \nwho is not a pastor or church official (Tr. 61). The friend is not a certified counselor (Tr. \n61-62). He completed all of the requirements of his diversion process (Tr. 74).  \n \nIn July 2008, Applicant\u2019s physician prescribed Antabuse for thirty days for \nApplicant at Applicant\u2019s request (Tr. 63, 65, 68). Applicant took Antabuse for three \nweeks (Tr. 64).4 He stopped taking Antabuse because he felt he did not need it (Tr. 64, \n69).   \n \nIn August 2008, he drank alcohol twice, and on each occasion he had a couple of \ndrinks (Tr. 71-73).5 He has not consumed any alcohol since then (Tr. 21, 22, 73). He \ncontended that the heart attack, termination from employment, and the DUI caused him \nto stop his alcohol consumption (Tr. 21, 22). He conceded that he was unable to abide \nby two or three previous promises to abstain from alcohol consumption (Tr. 46).      \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.g alleges that Applicant was diagnosed as alcohol dependent in \nSeptember 2008, and that he continued to consume alcohol until at least August 2008 \n(HE 2, 3). Applicant admitted the facts in SOR \u00b6 1.g (HE 3). Applicant denied \nconsuming alcohol after August 2008, and there is no evidence that Applicant \nconsumed alcohol after September 2008. \n \nApplicant did not receive any alcohol-related, professional counseling after \nSeptember 2008 (Tr. 84). He has continued to receive counseling from the friend who \nattends his church (Tr. 73, 84).6  He has not consumed alcohol for 16 months (Tr. 77-\n78). \n \nJuly to September 2008 alcohol-treatment notes, diagnosis, and prognosis \n \nFrom July 2008 to September 2008, Applicant received alcohol treatment and \ncounseling (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.f\u2014HE 2, 3). His primary physician prescribed Antabuse \n \n4On November 25, 2008, Applicant told an OPM investigator that he took Antabuse for about two \nweeks (GE 4 at 7). \n \n5On November 25, 2008, Applicant told an OPM investigator that he used alcohol twice in August \n2008, but his consumption was \u201cvery moderate as far as the amount the subject consumed and the \nsubject did not have the desire for more at those times either\u201d (GE 4 at 10). Applicant provided a \nstatement at his hearing indicating he \u201chad a drink twice in August 2008\u201d (AE B at 2). Later in that same \nstatement, he said he told his counselor that he had a couple of drinks but did not get drunk on the cruise \n(AE B at 3). \n  \n6In his closing argument, Applicant mentioned his friend was a former cocaine addict (Tr. 86). I \ndecline to draw any adverse inferences about his friend\u2019s qualifications from this disclosure during closing \narguments because arguments are not evidence.  \n\n \n5 \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nfor Applicant. He was diagnosed as an alcohol dependent. Applicant\u2019s therapy record \nfor July 1, 2008, states he was \u201cdrinking heavily\u201d from April 2008 until June 22, 2008 \n(GE 5 at 6). \u201cHe has had nite (sic) sweats [and] mild tremors. He had been drinking 1 \npint to 1 \u00bd pints daily since April\u201d (GE 5 at 6).7 The note for September 9, 2008, \nindicates Applicant \u201cgot drunk on vacation cruise Aug 8th\u201d (GE 5 at 7). The note for the \nSeptember 26, 2008, session indicates Applicant will find a new counselor when he \nmoves to a different state for employment and continue AA (GE 5 at 10). The final \nsession was on September 26, 2008 (GE 5 at 12). \n \nApplicant\u2019s counselor diagnosed him as alcohol dependent (AE A). Her \nprognosis for Applicant was excellent (AE A). She recommended that Applicant receive \na security clearance (AE A). Applicant\u2019s personal physician also indicated Applicant\u2019s \nprognosis was excellent and recommended Applicant for a security clearance (AE A).     \n \nAs indicated previously, Applicant\u2019s counselor\u2019s notes reflect that on July 1, 2008, \nApplicant told her that he drank a pint and a half of alcohol (Tr. 75). They also indicate \nshe recommended he attend AA meetings (Tr. 75). Applicant denied that he ever told \nher he consumed alcohol to that level (Tr. 75). He insisted that he did not drink more \nthan a half pint of rum (AE B at 2). He denied that he was a \u201cheavy drinker\u201d (Tr. 75). He \ndenied that he got drunk on the cruise, and said he only had \u201ca couple of drinks\u201d (AE B \nat 2). Applicant said he told his counselor about his friend, the counselor at his church \n(Tr. 75; AE B). He contends she agreed that this counseling was sufficient in lieu of \nprofessional counseling and AA meetings (Tr. 75; AE B). Applicant\u2019s counselor said \nApplicant had tremors, and Applicant denied that he did (Tr. 76; AE B at 2). He said he \nhad trouble sleeping since his heart attack (AE B at 2). \n \nPolicies \n \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the Applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \n \n7On November 25, 2008, Applicant told an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator, \nthat after April 2008, \u201cthe frequency to which he drank corresponded with the stress at work, but when he \ndid drink, it was moderately and not in excess and not to intoxication\u2014maybe 1-2 drinks to help the \nsubject relax\u201d (GE 4 at 7). \n\n \n6 \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nadministrative judge\u2019s over arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the [A]pplicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, \nnothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, \nin whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, \nloyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has not met the strict \nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a \nclearance. \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the Applicant that may disqualify the Applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an Applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the Applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An Applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security \nconcern is under Guideline G (alcohol consumption) with respect to the allegations set \nforth in the SOR. \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nAlcohol Consumption \n \n \nAG \u00b6 21 articulates the Government\u2019s concern about alcohol consumption, \n\u201c[e]xcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment \nor the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability \nand trustworthiness.\u201d \n  \n \n  \nSeven Alcohol Consumption disqualifying conditions could raise a security or \ntrustworthiness concern and may be disqualifying in this case. AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a) - 22(g) \nprovide:   \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent; \n \n(b) alcohol-related incidents at work, such as reporting for work or duty in \nan intoxicated or impaired condition, or drinking on the job, regardless of \nwhether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol \ndependent; \n \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol \nabuser or alcohol dependent; \n \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional (e.g., physician, \nclinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of alcohol abuse or alcohol \ndependence; \n \n(e) evaluation of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence by a licensed \nclinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol \ntreatment program; \n \n(f) relapse after diagnosis of alcohol abuse or dependence and completion \nof an alcohol rehabilitation program; and \n \n(g) failure to follow any court order regarding alcohol education, \nevaluation, treatment, or abstinence. \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 22(b), 22(d), 22(f), and 22(g) do not apply. Applicant did not consume \nalcohol at work or have any alcohol-related incidents at work. His alcohol consumption \nproblem was not diagnosed or evaluated \u201cby a duly qualified medical professional (e.g., \nphysician, clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist).\u201d Although he received some alcohol \ntreatment in the early 1990s, there is no clear evidence of a diagnosis of alcohol abuse \nor dependence. The file does not contain any records from that treatment. Applicant\u2019s \nSOR response is ambiguous about the diagnosis (he describes the diagnosis as \n\n \n8 \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \npotential alcohol abuse). There is a relapse after his treatment in the early 1990s. \nApplicant has not failed to comply with a court order not to consume alcohol. \n \nApplicant had one alcohol-related incident involving police intervention or arrest. \nHis DUI arrest was in June 2008. AG \u00b6 22(a) applies. Applicant occasionally consumed \na pint and a half of alcohol. This constitutes binge consumption of alcohol. AG \u00b6 22(c) \napplies. A licensed clinical social worker diagnosed Applicant as alcohol dependent. AG \n\u00b6 22(e) applies. \n \n  \n\u201cOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, \nthere is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 07-00852 at 3 (App. Bd. May 27, 2008) (citing Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 \nF.2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990)). Because the government has met its initial burden \nconcerning alcohol consumption security concerns, the burden now shifts to Applicant \nto establish any appropriate mitigating conditions. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. \n \n  \nFour Alcohol Consumption mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 23 are potentially \napplicable:  \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment; \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol \nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or \nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser); \n \n(c) the individual is a current employee who is participating in a counseling \nor treatment program, has no history of previous treatment and relapse, \nand is making satisfactory progress; and \n \n(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient \ncounseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as \nparticipation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar \norganization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff \nmember of a recognized alcohol treatment program. \nAG \u00b6 23(a) does not fully apply. Applicant had a DUI in June 2008. He most \nrecently drank to intoxication in August 2008. He described his current alcohol \nconsumption in his SOR response and at his hearing. However, the most accurate \ndescription of his alcohol consumption was provided in the alcohol-treatment notes of \n\n \n9 \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nhis counselor.8 Although his alcohol-related incident, a DUI, is relatively recent, it is a \nsingle incident and therefore infrequent. Applicant understated his alcohol consumption. \nWithout credible evidence of his current rate of alcohol consumption the likelihood of \nrecurrence of alcohol-related offenses cannot be sufficiently assessed to mitigate fully \nsecurity concerns.  \nSecurity clearance cases are difficult to compare, especially under Guideline G, \nbecause the facts, degree, and timing of the alcohol abuse and rehabilitation show \nmany different permutations. The Appeal Board has determined in cases of substantial \nalcohol abuse that AG \u00b6 23(b) did not mitigate security concerns unless there was a \nfairly lengthy period of abstaining from alcohol consumption.9  \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 23(b) to 23(d) do not fully apply. Applicant did not fully acknowledge or \ncompletely describe his history of alcohol consumption. He did not provide a thorough \nand accurate description of his current alcohol consumption. A licensed clinical social \nworker diagnosed Applicant as being alcohol dependent in September 2008. He made \nstatements that were inconsistent with his treatment records. A clearer and more \nforthright description of his past alcohol use would have helped to erase lingering \nconcerns. I am convinced he is minimizing his alcohol consumption problem, refusing to \nfully acknowledge the extent of his alcohol consumption problem. Statements from \ncolleagues, friends, or family members about his alcohol consumption would have been \nhelpful. Applicant has completed an alcohol treatment or counseling program. He \nreceived a positive prognosis; however, he did not continue his counseling with a \ncertified, professional counselor. He did not continue to attend Alcoholic Anonymous \nmeetings. His history of alcohol problems and his failure to continue with any credible, \ncertified, professional, or AA rehabilitation programs precludes providing full mitigating \ncredit under AG \u00b6 23.  \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.g allege that Applicant was prescribed Antabuse by his \nphysician, and he continued to consume alcohol after being diagnosed as alcohol \ndependent. Applicant\u2019s last established consumption of alcohol was in August 2008. \nSometime in the July to September 2008 period, he was diagnosed as alcohol \ndependent. His use of Antabuse is a mitigating circumstance. Accordingly, I find for \nApplicant at page 12, infra, with respect to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.g.   \n  \nApplicant\u2019s statement about abstaining from alcohol consumption after August \n2008 is a positive development, showing that he recognizes the importance of \novercoming his alcohol problems. However, after careful consideration of the Appeal \nBoard\u2019s jurisprudence on alcohol consumption,10 I conclude his single DUI in June \n \n8See Federal Rule of Evidence 803(4) and commentary explaining why statements made to \nobtain medical treatment are deemed reliable. \n \n9See ISCR Case No. 06-17541 at 3-5 (App. Bd. Jan. 14, 2008); ISCR Case No. 06-08708 at 5-7 \n(App. Bd. Dec. 17, 2007); ISCR Case No. 04-10799 at 2-4 (App. Bd. Nov. 9, 2007).   \n \n10For example, in ISCR Case No. 05-16753 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Aug. 2, 2007) the Appeal Board \nreversed the administrative judge\u2019s grant of a clearance and noted, \u201cThat Applicant continued to drink \neven after his second alcohol related arrest vitiates the Judge\u2019s application of MC 3.\u201d  In ISCR Case No. \n\n \n10 \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                                                                                                                            \n2008, his failure to be honest and forthright about his previous alcohol consumption, \nand the absence of detailed corroborating information about his current alcohol \nconsumption weigh against mitigating alcohol consumption concerns.  \n   \nWhole Person Concept \n \n Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline G in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nAlthough there is some evidence supporting approval of Applicant\u2019s clearance, \nthe mitigation evidence is insufficient to resolve security concerns. Applicant knows the \nconsequences of excessive alcohol consumption. He has had only one alcohol-related \noffense involving the police and the courts, a DUI in June 2008. He completed an \nalcohol-therapy program in the early 1990s and in September 2008, and received an \nexcellent prognosis from his counselor and personal physician. Applicant contributes to \nhis company and the Department of Defense. There is no evidence at work of any other \ndisciplinary problems. There is no evidence of disloyalty, or that he would intentionally \nviolate national security. His character and good work performance show some \nresponsibility, rehabilitation, and mitigation. His supervisors evidently support him or he \nwould not have been able to retain his employment after his security clearance was \ncalled into question.   \n \n \n05-10019 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2007), the Appeal Board reversed an administrative judge\u2019s grant of a \nclearance to an applicant (AB) where AB had several alcohol-related legal problems. However, AB\u2019s most \nrecent DUI was in 2000, six years before an administrative judge decided AB\u2019s case. AB had reduced his \nalcohol consumption, but still drank alcohol to intoxication, and sometimes drank alcohol (not to \nintoxication) before driving. The Appeal Board determined that AB\u2019s continued alcohol consumption was \nnot responsible, and the grant of AB\u2019s clearance was arbitrary and capricious. See also ISCR Case No. \n04-12916 at 2-6 (App. Bd. Mar. 21, 2007) (involving case with most recent alcohol-related incident three \nyears before hearing, and reversing administrative judge\u2019s grant of a clearance). \n\n \n11 \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nThe evidence against approval of Applicant\u2019s clearance is more substantial.  \nApplicant had a problem with alcohol use beginning in 1977, when he was a minor. He \ncontinued to consume alcohol at times to excess, with some periods of abstinence, until \nAugust 2008. He received intensive alcohol therapy in the early 1990s; however, he had \na relapse and returned to alcohol consumption a few months after completing this \nprogram. He had a DUI in June 2008. He declined a breath-alcohol test and there is no \nevidence to corroborate his contention that he only had four or \u201ca couple\u201d of drinks \nbefore driving. He told his therapist that he drinks a pint to a pint and a half of alcohol \nand that he got drunk in August 2008 on a cruise. She described tremors, which she \nrelated to his alcohol consumption. She recommended Applicant attend AA meetings \nand continue therapy or counseling.  \n \nApplicant denied that he told his therapist that he consumed up to a pint and a \nhalf of alcohol, and repeatedly said he stops consuming alcohol when he consumes a \nhalf pint of rum. In August 2008, he claimed he only had one drink or a couple of drinks \nand did not get drunk (Tr. 71-73; AE B). He told an OPM investigator that his alcohol \nconsumption on the cruise in August 2008 was \u201cvery moderate\u201d (GE 4 at 10). However, \nI find the therapist\u2019s notes to be more credible than Applicant\u2019s statements, which \nconflict with the contents of the therapy notes. I specifically find he told his counselor \nthat he got drunk on the cruise. Applicant said the only time he ever drove after drinking \nalcohol resulted in his DUI arrest and conviction (Tr. 39; GE 4 at 9). I am convinced \nApplicant is minimizing his alcohol consumption. He stated the last time he consumed \nalcohol was in August 2008. He did not provide any corroboration from friends and \nfamily of his contention of alcohol abstinence. Although he received an excellent \nprognosis from his therapist and personal physician, they may not be aware that he did \nnot attend AA or receive ongoing therapy or counseling from a professional, certified \ncounselor after September 2008. They may not be aware that he contested the \ninformation in his therapy notes about the degree of his alcohol consumption and was \nminimizing his alcohol consumption. As such their opinions about his prognosis are \ndiscounted. Applicant\u2019s failure to be candid and forthcoming about his alcohol \nconsumption at his hearing shows a lack of judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. \n \nI conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns pertaining to alcohol \nconsumption. I take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d11 \nand supporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas not mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I \nconclude he is not eligible for access to classified information. \n \n \n11See ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd.

On March 11, 2010, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\nthe basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations)\n\n2\nof Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On September 7, 2010, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Jennifer I.\nGoldstein denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following discussion, we affirm the Judge\u2019s\ndecision.\nThe Judge made the following factual findings: Applicant is 47 years old and is currently\nmarried to his fifth wife.  The SOR alleges 39 delinquent debts totaling $42,919.  Applicant admits\nall of the debts with some qualifications.  Applicant has not made payments on 32 of the debts.\nApplicant is indebted to a state Attorney General for $22,000 for delinquent child support.\nApplicant currently makes child support payments through payroll deductions and has disputed the\namount of the arrearage with the state, but the state has not reduced the amount of his debt.\nApplicant attributes his financial situation to \u201cbad spending habits,\u201d i.e., buying things on the\ninternet which he did not need.  Decision at 3.  Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties are ongoing, and\nhis monthly expenses exceed his income.  Applicant intends to file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, but\ncannot do so until he pays his attorney\u2019s full retainer fee.  \nApplicant maintains that the Judge did not give adequate attention to his case and makes\ngeneral comments about the fairness of the decision.  To support his argument, Applicant points to\nthe Judge\u2019s statement that she had not reviewed Applicant\u2019s case before the hearing.  Applicant also\ncontends that the Judge incorrectly stated the dates of his marriages and divorces.  The fact that the\nJudge did not review Applicant\u2019s case before the hearing is not indicative of error, since Applicant\u2019s\ntestimony and the parties\u2019 evidence submitted at the hearing and afterward were important parts of\nthe record which were not available to the Judge prior to the hearing.  Applicant\u2019s attribution of error\nwith regard to the dates of his marriages and divorces is clearly without basis, since the Judge did\nnot include any marriage or divorce dates in her decision.  Likewise, Applicant\u2019s comments on the\nfairness of the decision, especially concerning the clearances granted to others who he says were\nlater convicted of espionage, do not establish error, since the Board and the Judge are bound by the\nprovisions of the Directive as they apply to Applicant\u2019s case.  The Board does not have the authority\nto waive provisions of the Directive.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 08-08012 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 20,\n2009).  Nor does the Board have the authority to entertain challenges to the wisdom or legality of\nprovisions of the Directive.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 09-03724 at 2 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2010); and\nISCR Case No. 04-01961 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 12, 2007).   \nApplicant contends that he has mitigated any concerns that might exist under Guideline F\nand that the Judge either did not consider or did not give adequate weight to  his evidence of\nmitigation.  In his appeal, Applicant restates some of the mitigating evidence that is contained in the\nrecord.  In particular, Applicant states that he submitted documentation (Applicant Exhibits (AE)\nB-D) after the hearing, according to the Judge\u2019s instructions; yet he does not believe that the Judge\nmentioned those materials in her decision.  There is a rebuttable presumption that the Judge\nconsidered all the record evidence, unless the Judge specifically states otherwise; and there is no\n\n3\nrequirement that the Judge mention or discuss every piece of record evidence when reaching a\ndecision.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-18303 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 13, 2008).  Applicant submitted\none exhibit at the hearing and three while the record was held open afterward.  The Judge cited all\nfour exhibits in her decision, specifically mentioning Applicant\u2019s dealings with his bankruptcy\nattorney (AE C) and his current child support payments (AE D). \n                        \nApplicant admitted, with some qualifications, the SOR allegations against him.  The burden\nthen shifted to Applicant to extenuate or mitigate the security concerns raised by those allegations.\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15.  The Judge concluded that Applicant did not present evidence sufficient to\novercome the security concerns raised.  The application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions\nand whole-person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the\nparticular facts of a case.  Thus, the presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel\nthe Judge to make a favorable security clearance determination.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has\nto weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the\nunfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  Here, the Judge did not give as much weight to Applicant\u2019s\nmitigating evidence as Applicant would have liked.  However, a party\u2019s disagreement with the\nJudge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence,\nis not sufficient to demonstrate that the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a\nmanner\nthat is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 08-01105 at 2 (App. Bd.\nDec. 15, 2008).\nApplicant points out that being denied a security clearance would have an adverse impact\non his career and his continued ability to improve his financial situation.  However, the effect that\nan unfavorable decision may have on an applicant is not a relevant or material consideration in\nevaluating his or her security eligibility.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 08-07528 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 29,\n2009).\nA review of the record indicates that the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by\nApplicant against his financial history and considered the possible application of relevant mitigating\nconditions and whole person factors.  Decision at 5-7.  The Judge reasonably explained why the\nevidence Applicant had presented in mitigation was insufficient to overcome all of the government\u2019s\nsecurity concerns.  The Judge made favorable formal findings concerning two of the debts alleged\nin the SOR.  Id.  The Board does not review a case de novo.  The favorable evidence cited by\nApplicant is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary\nto law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-11172 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 4,  2007).  \nThe Judge examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for her\ndecision,  \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor\nVehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States, Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43\n(1983) (quoting Burlington Truck Lines v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  \u201cThe general\nstandard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the\nnational security.\u2019\u201d Dep\u2019t of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  A history of financial\nproblems is a circumstance that raises security concerns.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4\n\n4\n(App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004).  In light of the record here, the Board concludes that the Judge had a\nrational basis for concluding that Applicant\u2019s history of financial difficulties raised such concerns\nand that Applicant did not present evidence sufficient to extenuate or mitigate those concerns.\nAccordingly, the Judge\u2019s decision is sustainable.\nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s decision denying Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Michael D.

The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective for cases issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on April 9, 2010, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. The case was assigned to another judge on May 24, 2010. \nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on May 27, 2010, scheduling the hearing for July 1, \n2010. Applicant requested a continuance and his request was granted. The case was \n\n \n2 \n \nreassigned to me on June 17, 2010. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on July 1, 2010, \nscheduling the hearing for July 29, 2010. The hearing was convened as scheduled. The \nGovernment offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 7, which were admitted without objection. \nThe Applicant offered Exhibit (AE) A, which was admitted without objection, and testified \non his own behalf. The record was held open for Applicant to submit additional \ninformation until close of business August 5, 2010. Applicant submitted post-hearing \nexhibits B through D, which were admitted without objection. Applicant presented no \ncharacter witnesses or letters of support. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing \n(Tr.) on August 6, 2010.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 47 year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been with \nhis current employer since July 2008. He has been divorced four times and is currently \nmarried to his 5th wife. His wife suffers from systemic lupus and she is unable to work. \nHe has two children, ages 21 and 14. He volunteers for a university emergency \nresponse team. (GE 1; Tr. 23-30, 32, 39, 48-51.) \n \n \nThe SOR alleges 39 delinquent debts totaling $42,919, which are all \nsubstantiated in the record. Applicant admitted all of the debts alleged in SOR, with \nsome qualifications, addressed below. He has not made payments on 32 of the \naccounts listed in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through1.f, 1.h. through 1.q., 1.s. through 1.z., 1.bb through \n1.cc., 1.ff. through 1.jj., and 1.mm. However, he claims he has satisfied the debt stated \nin \u00b6 1.r, totaling $25. He asserts that he is making payments on 1.aa. He contests 1.g., \n1.dd., 1.ee., 1.kk., and 1.ll. (Answer; GE 2; GE 3; GE 4; GE 5; GE 6; GE 7.) Applicant\u2019s \nqualifications to his admissions are as follows:  \n \n \nThe debt in 1.r. was for a medical collection account in the amount of $25. \nAttached to his Answer, Applicant presented a copy of his VISA statement showing that \na $25 payment was made to this creditor on March 24, 2010. (Answer; Tr. 42.) \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.aa. alleges Applicant was 120 days past due to a creditor in the \napproximate amount of $21, on a balance of $1,067. Applicant testified that he was \nmaking payments on this account. He asserted that he only had $460 left to pay on this \ndebt. Attached to his Answer, he presented an online payment history showing five \npayments of $50, made in January through March of 2010. However, it is unclear from \nthe face of this document that the payments are going to the creditor alleged in 1.aa. \n(Answer; Tr. 43.) \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g. alleges Applicant is indebted on a medical account placed for \ncollection in the approximate amount of $125. Applicant contends that this debt is a \nduplicate of the debt alleged in 1.f., with an additional collections fee added. He \npresented no documentation to substantiate this claim. However, entries for each of \nthese allegations on Applicant\u2019s credit reports show the same account number, which \nmatch the medical accounts and amounts alleged in 1.g. and 1.f. (Answer; GE 5; GE 6; \nGE 7.) \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.dd. alleges Applicant is indebted to a university in the \napproximate amount of $268. This debt was for a student loan. In his Answer, Applicant \ncontends that he dropped this class and that the university refunded the money back to \nthe lender. At the time he completed the interrogatories in January 2010, he indicated \nthis debt was for an online course Applicant took and that he was making payments on \nthe debt. He failed to produce documentation that he has disputed or otherwise \naddressed this debt. (Answer; GE 2.) \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.ee. alleges Applicant is indebted to a state Attorney General for \ndelinquent child support in the amount of $22,000. Applicant admits that he is behind on \nhis child support, but contends he is only past due by approximately $500. He testified \nthat his wages were being automatically deposited from his pay into his ex-wife\u2019s \naccount at the rate of $125 per week for his child support obligation. He presented pay \nstatements that show a $125 distribution from his pay directly to a bank account \noccurred on a weekly basis from April through December of 2007. He claims that the \nmother of his child fraudulently filed a state claim against him. He presented April 2008 \ne-mails from his ex-wife requesting delinquent child support payments in the amount of \n$1,625. He asserted that shortly after she sent the e-mails, she filed with the state for \nback child support, claiming he had not paid her in four years. He contested the debt \nwith the state and sent the state the e-mail from his ex-wife as proof he owed much \nless. He relayed that the state responded that the e-mails were insufficient proof of \npayment. (AE A; AE D; Tr. 24-27; 40-41, 53-54.) \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.kk. alleges Applicant is indebted on a phone bill that has been \nplaced for collections. Applicant contends that he has been disputing this debt with the \ncreditor, because he believes the bill was excessive. He failed to produce \ndocumentation to support his dispute. At the time he completed the interrogatories, he \nindicated he would negotiate a settlement on this debt. Applicant failed to present \ndocumentation to support a negotiated settlement. (Answer; GE 2.) \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.ll. alleges Applicant is indebted to a creditor in the approximate \namount of $216. Applicant noted that he has tried to contact this creditor, but has been \nunable to reach the collections agent. However, in Applicant\u2019s answer to the \ninterrogatories, he indicated he paid $55 on this debt, but the creditor still expected to \nreceive payment in full. Applicant failed to present documentation to support any \npayments or dispute filed on this debt. (Answer; GE 2.) \n \n \nApplicant attributes all of his debts to bad spending habits. He \u201cturned to getting \nonline and just buying things that [he] wanted, for no reason.\u201d He financed his bad \nspending habits by taking out payday loans which he was not able to keep current.1 He \nalso moved twice in 2005 and worked at a low paying job from March 2005 through \nSeptember 2005, after he had been laid-off from a higher paying position. Applicant did \nnot have medical insurance during this time period, and incurred the medical debts \nlisted in the SOR. (AE B; Tr. 56-58.) \n                                                          \n1 At hearing, Applicant disclosed that he was bi-polar. He disclosed that in a manic state, he would make \ninternet purchases, but that he had been properly medicated since approximately 2000 or 2001. He \nasserted that only one debt, subparagraph 1.cc., was directly attributable to his condition. (Tr. 28-30.) \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant intends to address all of his debts by filing Chapter 7 bankruptcy. He \nretained a bankruptcy lawyer on or about June 5, 2010 to assist him with this process. \nTo date, he has paid the attorney approximately $600 of the $3,700 retainer fee. As part \nof the process of preparing to file bankruptcy, Applicant testified that he participated in a \ntwo-hour online financial course. There is no evidence that the bankruptcy petition has \nbeen filed. (AE C; Tr. 24-39, 60.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s personal financial statement indicates that he has a negative monthly \nnet remainder of -$254.24. He failed to produce any character evidence. (GE 2.) \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \n\n \n5 \n \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18, as \nfollows:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concern under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant accumulated $42,919 in delinquent debts and has been unable to pay \nthe majority of his obligations. His financial problems have been ongoing since at least \n2005. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \n \n \n  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n\n \n6 \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial delinquencies are recent and ongoing. He has not \ndemonstrated that his financial problems are unlikely to recur. His track record shows \nhe has ignored his delinquencies and he has failed to address his delinquent accounts \nin a meaningful way. His failure to repay his creditors over the past five years \ndemonstrates that he lacks good judgment. Thus, AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \n \n \nApplicant partially attributes his debts to lay-off, and period of low income without \nmedical insurance, in 2005. However, he also accepts culpability for making internet \npurchases that he could not afford. He admitted that he had bad spending habits. \nApplicant does not dispute that he is responsible for paying the majority of the debt. \nApplicant has been ignoring the delinquent accounts he was legally responsible for, \nover a number of years. AG \u00b6 20(b) is inapplicable, as well. \n \n \nApplicant presented information that he completed a two-hour online financial \ncourse as part of preparing to file bankruptcy. However, it was unclear what lessons \nApplicant learned in that course. He had the burden to establish that his financial \nproblems were under control and he did not meet that burden. AG \u00b6 20(c) does not \napply. \n \n \nApplicant has not made a good-faith effort to pay or resolve his delinquent debts. \nHe has satisfied a $25 debt alleged in 1.r. However, the rest of his debts remain \nunsatisfied. He has made some initial steps toward filing bankruptcy and plans to \ninclude his unpaid debts in his bankruptcy filing, but he still has a significant bill to pay \nhis attorney, before the bankruptcy will even be filed. Given his track record of failing to \nmeet his financial obligations, he has not established mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(d). \n \n \nAlthough Applicant disputes the validity of the debts in subparagraphs 1.dd., \n1.ee., and 1.kk, he has been unable to provide documented proof of the dispute or his \nattempts to resolve these debts with each of these creditors. AG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n\n \n7 \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment.  \n \nApplicant has taken some initial steps to file bankruptcy. However, his actions \ncome too late. He has had financial problems for a number of years and has presented \nlittle evidence to show that he acted responsibly in light of his financial situation. He has \nnot demonstrated any change in spending habits or any other form of rehabilitation. \nGiven Applicant\u2019s past irresponsible spending, it is likely that he will continue to \nexperience financial problems in the future even if he does discharge his debt through \nbankruptcy.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the Financial Considerations security concern.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g.:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.i.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.j.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.k.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.k.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.l.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.m.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.n.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.o.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.p.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.q.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.r.:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.s.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.t.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.u.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.v.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.w.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.x.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.y.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.z.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.aa.: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.bb.: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.cc.: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.dd.: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.ee.: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.ff.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.gg.: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.hh.: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.ii.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.jj.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.kk.: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.ll.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.mm.: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Applicant is a 45-year-old mail clerk employed by a defense contractor since August 1998. She graduated from high school in 1984. Applicant testified she was granted access to classified information at the top secret level shortly after she submitted her 2008 SCA. Her access to classified information was suspended when she was issued her SOR. She indicated that her position and pay were downgraded after her clearance was suspended.

Her evidence is insufficient to establish a good-faith effort in the \nresolution of these debts, or a current track record of financial responsibility. There are \nno clear indications that her financial problems are being resolved or are under control. \nClearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \n1 \n \n \n                                           \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on August 25, 2008. \nAfter reviewing the results of the ensuing background investigation, adjudicators for the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) were unable to make a preliminary \naffirmative finding1 that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nApplicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  \n \n1 Required by Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated \nFebruary 20, 1960, as amended; and Department of Defense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as revised. \nSeptember 30, 2011\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                                                                                                            \n \nOn July 6, 2010, DOHA issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging \nsecurity concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG).2  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on November 29, 2010. She requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on June 3, 2011. DOHA \nissued a notice of hearing on June 9, 2011, convening a hearing on July 20, 2011. At \nthe hearing, the Government offered four exhibits (GE 1 through 4). Applicant testified, \nand offered three exhibits (AE 1 through 3). AE 3 was received post-hearing.3 All \nexhibits were received without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing \n(Tr.) on July 27, 2011.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted the factual allegations under SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c through 1.e, 1.l, and \n1.m. She denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.f through 1.k. Her admissions are incorporated \nas findings of fact. After a thorough review of the evidence of record, her answers to the \nSOR and interrogatories, and her demeanor and testimony, I make the following \nadditional findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is a 45-year-old mail clerk employed by a defense contractor since \nAugust 1998. She graduated from high school in 1984. Applicant testified she was \ngranted access to classified information at the top secret level shortly after she \nsubmitted her 2008 SCA. Her access to classified information was suspended when she \nwas issued her SOR. She indicated that her position and pay were downgraded after \nher clearance was suspended. There is no evidence she has compromised or caused \nothers to compromise classified information. She married her husband in May 2007. \nShe has a 28-year-old daughter from a prior relationship, and five stepchildren ages 22, \n21, 21, 18, and 15. Her daughter is self-supporting, and it is unclear whether Applicant \nprovides support for her stepchildren. \n \nIn her answers to the financial questions in her August 2008 SCA, Applicant \nindicated that during the last seven years she had no property repossessed for failing to \npay a debt, that she did not have any debts over 180 days delinquent, and that she was \nnot currently over 90 days delinquent on any debts. Applicant\u2019s background \ninvestigation addressed her financial problems and revealed the 13 delinquent debts \nalleged in the SOR, totaling $19,616.  \n \n \n \n2 Adjudication of this case is controlled by the AGs, implemented by the DOD on September 1, \n2006. \n \n3 AE3 is an unsigned letter, presumably to the credit bureaus (addressed \u201cTo whom it may \nconcern\u201d), dated August 4, 2011 (post-hearing), disputing a $30 medical debt. \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant explained that in 2000, she was in a relationship with a man and they \npurchased a home together. In July 2007, the relationship ended and she refinanced \nthe home individually to buy out her partner. She took a mortgage, and at the time, she \nbelieved that all her insurance and taxes were also included in the monthly mortgage \npayments. Later on, she discovered that was not the case. She was unable to meet her \nmortgage payments because of the additional mortgage expenses and because her \nmortgage payments ballooned. She claimed that even though her financial situation was \nstrained, she was making her payments on time until one of her mortgage payments \nwas lost. After that, she was not able to catch up with the mortgage payments.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s home was foreclosed in 2007, and sold in a foreclosure auction in \nApril 2008. Her deficiency on the home mortgage payments is alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e. \nShe does not know how much she owes as a result of the mortgage foreclosure and \nauction of her home. She claimed she tried to contact the lender to modify her \nmortgage, but received no assistance. Applicant presented no documentary evidence to \nsupport her claim of negotiations with the lender. \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.f through 1.k allege seven delinquent medical accounts, \nwhich Applicant denied. These accounts are established as Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts \non the September 2008 (GE 3) and March 2010 (GE 4) credit reports. At her hearing, \nApplicant claimed she contacted all her medical providers to determine whether these \nare her delinquent debts. She claimed she was told by some of the medical providers \nthat she is no longer in their accounting systems. She did not receive a response from \nother medical providers. Applicant also claimed she did not recognize the debt or the \ncreditor alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.k. She presented no documentary evidence to support her \nclaims of efforts taken to contact providers, to dispute her debts, or to otherwise resolve \nthose debts. \n \nApplicant admitted the delinquent medical account alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c. She \nclaimed she paid that debt in April 2011. She presented no documentary evidence to \nsupport her claim. Concerning SOR \u00b6 1.l, Applicant testified she telephonically \ncontacted the creditor two years ago, and again the Friday before her hearing (July 15, \n2011). She claimed the creditor informed her telephonically that she was no longer in \ntheir system. (Tr. 46-47) She presented no documentary evidence to support her \nclaims. Concerning the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.m, Applicant admitted that she \npurchased a dining table on credit, and that account became delinquent six years ago. \nShe claimed she contacted the creditor the day before her hearing and settled the $700 \ndelinquent account for $400. (Tr. 36) She has to pay the $400 sometime in the near \nfuture to take advantage of the settlement offer. She presented no documentary \nevidence of any payments made. \n \nA review of Applicant\u2019s credit reports (GE 2, 3, and 4) show that she paid other \ndelinquent debts, including some delinquent medical accounts. The credit reports also \ndocument the debts alleged in the SOR as Applicant\u2019s debts, which have been \ndelinquent for a number of years. She presented no documentary evidence of any \npayments made toward any of the SOR debts. Applicant\u2019s November 2009 personal \n\n \n4 \n \n \nfinancial statement indicates a net monthly income of approximately $1,760. Her \nmonthly expenses totaled $1,275. She listed no monthly debt payments. Applicant did \nnot participate in financial counseling, and she does not have a working budget. (Tr. 67) \n \nApplicant expressed remorse for her financial situation. She understands she is \nresponsible for her financial obligations and intends to pay them sometime in the future. \nShe needs her job to pay her delinquent obligations and support her family. Without her \nsecurity clearance, she believes she would lose her job. She developed financial \nproblems because she was a single parent and struggled to make ends meet. She \nbelieves she was doing all that she could do under her circumstances. Although \nApplicant is currently married and her spouse works, he does not contribute financially \nto the household. (Tr. 66-67)  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nThe President of the United States has the authority to control access to \ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is \nsufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 527 (1988). The President has authorized the Secretary of \nDefense to grant eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. The U.S. \nSupreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive Branch in \nregulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing that \u201cno \none has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These AGs are not inflexible rules of \nlaw. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and \npresent, favorable and unfavorable to reach his decision.  \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, a \nclearance decision is merely an indication that the Applicant has or has not met the \n\n \n5 \n \n \nstrict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing \na clearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue [his or her] security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nUnder Guideline F, the security concern is that failure or inability to live within \none\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-\ncontrol, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified information. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having \nto engage in illegal acts to generate funds. AG \u00b6 18. \n \nThe evidence established that Applicant acquired the 13 delinquent debts alleged \nin the SOR, totaling $19,600, that have been delinquent for a number of years. AG \u00b6 \n19(a): \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c): \u201ca history of not \nmeeting financial obligations,\u201d apply.  \n \n \nApplicant has a history of ongoing financial problems, dating back to 2004, and \nthe evidence fails to show they developed under circumstances that are unlikely to \nrecur. She continues to acquire delinquent debt without resolving her past delinquent \nfinancial obligations. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply.  \n \n \nApplicant presented some evidence to establish circumstances beyond her \ncontrol contributing to her inability to pay her debts, e.g., her 2004 separation from her \n\n \n6 \n \n \npartner, and she was self-supporting until she married her husband in 2007. According \nto Applicant, her husband does not currently contribute financially to the household.  \n \n \nNotwithstanding, Applicant has been gainfully employed for the same \nGovernment contractor since 1998. Her circumstances do not fully explain her \nprecarious financial situation. Applicant presented no evidence of contacts with \ncreditors, settlement agreements, or payments made to the SOR creditors. The only \ndocumentary evidence of efforts to dispute her debts was an unsigned letter, dated \nAugust 4, 2011, that was submitted post hearing. (AE 3) Applicant\u2019s documentary \nevidence is not sufficient to show that she made good-faith efforts to resolve her debts, \nor that she has a track record of financial responsibility. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and (d) do not \napply. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply because there are no clear indications that her \nfinancial problems are being resolved or under control. She did not receive financial \ncounseling. The remaining mitigating conditions are not reasonably supported by the \nfacts in this case. \n \n \nConsidering the number of delinquent debts, the date the debts were acquired, \nthe aggregate value of the debts, and the limited documentary evidence of efforts to \nresolve her legal financial obligations, Applicant\u2019s information is insufficient to establish \nthat her financial problems will be resolved in the foreseeable future, or that they are \nunlikely to recur.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider \nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole-person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c). I have incorporated in my whole-\nperson analysis my comments on the analysis of Guideline F. \n\n \n7 \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant receives credit for her \nwork history with a Government contractor. She has held a security clearance since \n2008, with no adverse incidents. She is a good mother and wife. \n \nConsidering the record as a whole, I find that security concerns remain about \nApplicant\u2019s current financial responsibility, reliability, and judgment. Applicant\u2019s evidence \nfailed to show financial responsibility in the acquisition of the debts, good-faith efforts to \nresolve her financial problems in a timely manner, or a current track record of financial \nresponsibility. Applicant\u2019s information is insufficient to establish that her financial \nproblems will be resolved in the foreseeable future, or that they are unlikely to recur. \nThe mitigating record evidence fails to convince me of Applicant\u2019s suitability for a \nsecurity clearance. Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from her \nfinancial considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.m:  \n  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant eligibility for a security clearance to \nApplicant. Clearance is denied. \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nJUAN J. RIVERA \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Minster, Esq., Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se  \n                     \n           \n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny or revoke his\neligibility for a security clearance to work in the defense industry. The evidence shows\nApplicant has a history of not meeting financial obligations as well as inability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts. This is demonstrated by more than $100,000 in unpaid\ndelinquent debts, including many student loans in collection. He did not present\nsufficient  evidence of a good-faith effort to repay or otherwise resolve his indebtedness.\nThere is insufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns\nstemming from his financial problems. Accordingly, as explained in further detail below,\nthis case is decided against Applicant.\nAugust 18, 2010\n\n  This case is adjudicated under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry,\n1\nsigned by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended, as well as DoD Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program, dated January 2, 1992, as amended\n(Directive). In addition, the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified\nInformation (AG), effective within the Defense Department on September 1, 2006, apply to this case. The AG\nwere published in the Federal Register and codified in 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 154, Appendix H (2006). The AG replace\nthe guidelines in Enclosure 2 to the Directive.    \n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.7. \n2\n The file of relevant material consists of Department Counsel\u2019s written brief and supporting evidence, some\n3\nof which is identified as exhibits in this decision.  \n Exhibit 5. \n4\n2\nStatement of the Case\nActing under the relevant Executive Order and DoD Directive,  on March 9, 2010,\n1\nthe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (the Agency) issued a statement of\nreasons (SOR) explaining it was unable to find it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant access to classified information. The SOR is similar to a\ncomplaint, and it detailed the factual basis for the action under the security guideline\nknown as Guideline F for financial considerations. The SOR also recommended that the\ncase be submitted to an administrative judge to decide whether to deny or revoke\nApplicant\u2019s security clearance.  \nApplicant answered the SOR in a timely fashion, and he did not request a\nhearing. Accordingly, the case will be decided on the written record.2\nOn May 26, 2010, the Agency submitted its written case consisting of all relevant\nand material information that could be adduced at a hearing.  This so-called file of\n3\nrelevant material (FORM) was received by Applicant on June 2, 2010. He then had 30\ndays to respond with objections, rebuttal, extenuation, mitigation, or explanation, but he\ndid not respond within the 30-day period. The case was assigned to me August 11,\n2010. \nFindings of Fact\nBased on the evidence as a whole, the following facts are established by\nsubstantial evidence.\nApplicant is a 31-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He has never\nmarried and has no children. His educational background includes a bachelor\u2019s degree\nin computer science awarded in December 2005. As reported in his security clearance\napplication, he attended college during the period of 1997\u20132005.    \n4\n\n Exhibit 6 at 2 of 14. \n5\n Exhibit 5. \n6\n Exhibit 6 at 11 of 14. \n7\n Exhibits 7 and 8. \n8\n Exhibit 6 at 12 of 14. \n9\n Exhibit 6 at 13 of 14. \n10\n Exhibit 6 at 14 of 14. \n11\n Exhibit 6 at 4 of 14. \n12\n3\nApplicant is currently employed as a software engineer.  His security clearance\n5\napplication reflects that he has worked in the information technology (IT) field since\nJune 2006, shortly after he earned his bachelor\u2019s degree.  His annual gross income is\n6\nabout $67,680.7\nApplicant has a history of financial problems. The SOR alleges 20 delinquent\ndebts with various creditors for more than $100,000. The delinquent debts are\nestablished by Applicant\u2019s admissions and the information in the credit reports.  Many of\n8\nthe delinquent debts are student loans in collection. \nApplicant did not present documentary evidence showing he paid, settled, or\notherwise resolved the debts. He did present documentary evidence showing the\nfollowing: (1) payments on a judgment with a balance of $267 as of December 2009;9\n(2) entry into a loan-rehabilitation program for a student loan with a balance of $4,470\nas of January 2010;  and entry into a debt-management plan for five accounts for a\n10\ntotal of $1,290 as of January 2010.  He attributes his financial problems to falling\n11\nbehind on his payments in about 2006 because he was not earning sufficient income.   \n12\nLaw and Policies\nThis section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an\nindustrial security clearance case. The only purpose of a clearance decision is to decide\nif an applicant is suitable for access to classified information. The Department of\nDefense takes the handling and safeguarding of classified information seriously\nbecause it affects our national security, the lives of our servicemembers, and our\noperations abroad. \n\n Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \u2018right\u2019 to\n13\na security clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10  Cir. 2002) (no right to a\nth\nsecurity clearance).\n 484 U.S. at 531.\n14\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n15\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n16\n ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004).\n17\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n18\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n19\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n20\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n21\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n22\n4\nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.  As\n13\nnoted by the Supreme Court in Department of Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent\nstandard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the\nside of denials.\u201d  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt\n14\nabout whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be\nresolved in favor of protecting national security.  \nA favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted\na security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.  An\n15\nunfavorable decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing security\nclearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.  \n16\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for\naccess to classified information.  The Government has the burden of presenting\n17\nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An\n18\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nfacts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate\n19\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme\n20\nCourt stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.21\nThe DOHA Appeal Board has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of\nfact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.22\nThe AG set forth the relevant standards to consider when evaluating a person\u2019s\nsecurity clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions\nfor each guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a commonsense\ndecision based upon consideration of all the relevant and material information, the\npertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-person concept. \n\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n23\n AG \u00b6\u00b6 18, 19, and 20 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating conditions). \n24\n See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996) (It is well settled that \u201cthe security suitability of an\n25\napplicant is placed into question when that applicant is shown to have a history of excessive indebtedness\nor recurring financial difficulties.\u201d) (citation omitted). \n AG \u00b6 18.  \n26\n AG \u00b6 19(a).  \n27\n AG \u00b6 19(c). \n28\n5\nThe Government must be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in\nthose persons to whom it grants access to classified information. The decision to deny a\nperson a security clearance is not a determination of an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it\n23\nis a determination that an applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has\nestablished for granting eligibility for access.\nAnalysis\nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations,  the suitability of an applicant\n24\nmay be questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive\nindebtedness or financial problems or difficulties.  The overall concern under Guideline\n25\nF is that: \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information.  \n26\nSimilarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible,\nunconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and safeguarding classified\ninformation within the defense industry. Indeed, the practice of evaluating a person\nbased on their record of financial responsibility (or lack thereof) is used in various\nindustries. For example, the insurance industry uses credit-based insurance scores\nwhen determining insurance rates because the scores have been found to be effective\nin predicting future losses.  \nThe evidence here supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial\nproblems. This history raises concerns because it indicates inability or unwillingness to\nsatisfy debts  and a history of not meeting financial obligations  within the meaning of\n27\n28\nGuideline F. The facts are sufficient to establish these two disqualifying conditions, and\nthe facts suggest financial irresponsibility as well.    \n\n AG \u00b6 20 (a) \u2013 (f) (setting forth six mitigating conditions). \n29\n6\nUnder Guideline F, there are six conditions that may, individually or in\ncombination, mitigate security concerns:29\n \n(a) The behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment;\n(b) The conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n(c) The person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control;\n(d) The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts;\n(e) The individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the\npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides\ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n(f) The affluence resulted from a legal source of income.\nOf those mitigating conditions, the most pertinent here is subparagraph (d). The\nevidence shows he has taken some action to repay his delinquent debts. But the\nevidence also shows his efforts have just begun and address only a small portion of his\nmore than $100,000 in delinquent debt. Applicant overextended himself and put himself\nin a high-risk position by incurring more debt than he could repay. He is now dealing\nwith the consequences. What is missing here is a well-established track record of\nrepayment. Although he might have good intentions, his track record of repayment is\ninsufficient to mitigate the security concerns. Looking forward, it is too soon to rule out\nthe likelihood of additional financial problems. Likewise, it is too soon to determine if\nApplicant is now conducting his affairs in a financially-responsible manner to avoid\nsimilar problems in the future.  \n \nTo conclude, the facts and circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s ongoing\nfinancial problems justify current doubts about his judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness. Following Egan and the clearly-consistent standard, I resolve these\ndoubts in favor of protecting national security. In reaching this conclusion, I gave due\n\n AG \u00b6 2(a)(1) \u2013 (9).\n30\n7\nconsideration to the whole-person concept  and Applicant\u2019s favorable evidence.\n30\nNevertheless, Applicant did not meet his ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a\nfavorable clearance decision. This case is decided against Applicant. \nFormal Findings\nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations are as follows:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a\u20131.t:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied.        \nMichael H. Leonard\nAdministrative Judge \n",

The debts were listed on credit reports \nobtained on November 15, 2008 and September 21, 2009. Applicant admitted owing the \ndebts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.e, and 1.h to 1.k. She denied owing the debts in the \nremaining allegations. The status of the debts alleged in the SOR is addressed below. \n \n \nApplicant denied owing the medical debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, 1.d, 1.f, \nand 1.m to 1.p because she did not recognize the creditors. All the debts were listed on \nthe 2008 credit report. The debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, 1.d, and 1.f were also \nlisted on the 2009 credit report. Applicant and her husband had medical insurance and \nshe thought all their medical bills had been paid. She has not formally disputed any of \nthe debts.3 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.g alleges a delinquent debt of $288 owed to a collection company, \ncollecting on behalf of a cellular telephone services company. Applicant had a contract \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 33, 68, 73-74; GE 1. \n \n2 Tr. at 25-28; GE 2. \n \n3 Tr. at 44-48; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2-4. \n\n \n3 \n \nwith the company several years ago and ended the service before the end of the \ncontract. She never received a final bill and did not realize there was a balance due.4   \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.i alleges a delinquent debt of $10,728 owed on the deficiency on a truck \nloan after Applicant\u2019s truck was voluntarily repossessed in about February 2008. \nApplicant and the collection company handling the debt agreed to settle the debt for \n$5,500 in June 2009. The settlement agreement called for three monthly payments of \n$100 in July through September 2009, followed by a $5,200 payment in October 2009. \nApplicant made five payments of $108 to the collection company, one in July, two in \nAugust, and two in September 2009. She was unable to make any additional payments \nbecause she was placed on bed rest and unable to work for several months pending the \nbirth of her twins. She received disability, which she estimated was about 75% of her \nregular pay. Applicant intends to resume making the monthly payments.5  \n \n \nApplicant admitted that she was 30 days and $1,040 past-due on a car loan, as \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.k. She made payments in about August 2009 to bring the debt \ncurrent. The loan then became delinquent again while she was on bed rest. The car \nwas repossessed in about October 2009.6  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.l alleges a delinquent debt of $2,370 owed to a collection company, \ncollecting on behalf of the landlord of an apartment where Applicant and her family used \nto live. Applicant had insect problems at the apartment that the landlord refused to fix. \nShe withheld rent and the landlord issued a notice to evict them. They then moved out. \nApplicant did not receive her deposit back. She disputed owing $2,370, because \nanother tenant moved into the apartment the next month. The debt is listed on the 2008 \ncredit report, but not the 2009 report.7   \n \n \nApplicant denied owing the $236 delinquent debt to a collection company on \nbehalf of a telecommunications company, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.q. She stated that she \ndid not recognize the companies. The debt is listed on the 2008 credit report, but not the \n2009 report.8  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.r alleges a delinquent debt of $851 owed to a collection company, \ncollecting on behalf of a chain restaurant. Applicant disputed owing the debt. There is \nno evidence that Applicant ever owed $851 to the restaurant The 2008 credit report \nlisted the debt with a balance of $32. The debt is not listed on the 2009 report.9   \n                                                          \n4 Tr. at 48-49; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2-4. \n \n5 Tr. at 26-43; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2; AE C. \n \n6 Tr. at 51-54; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2. \n \n7 Tr. at 55-63; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2-4. \n \n8 Tr. at 63-64; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 3, 4. \n \n9 Tr. at 64-65; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 3, 4. \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant admitted owing the remaining debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.e, 1.h, \nand 1.j. The total amount owed on those four debts is $3,017. The debts range from $37 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.b) to $1,503 (SOR \u00b6 1.e) owed to a jewelry store. None of the debts have \nbeen paid.10 \n \n \nApplicant had not received financial counseling as of the date of the hearing. \nAfter the hearing, she researched a well-known financial advisor through the internet. \nShe has plans to attend classes provided at a local church. She and her husband are \nable to pay their current debts on their combined income, but they have little \ndiscretionary income after their bills are paid. She stated that it will take time, but she \nplans to address her delinquent debts.11   \n \n \nApplicant is a valued and trusted employee. Her supervisor praised her \nexceptional job performance, as well as her ethics, honesty, and integrity. Additional \nletters attest that she is hardworking, forthright, reliable, trustworthy, and responsible. \nThe character references recommend her for a security clearance.12   \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \n                                                          \n10 Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 3, 4. \n \n11 Tr. at 71-73; AE D, G. \n \n12 AE A, B, E, F. \n\n \n5 \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18, as \nfollows:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant accumulated a number of delinquent debts and was unable or unwilling \nto pay her obligations. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying \nconditions. \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \n  \nFive Financial Considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant still has a number of delinquent debts. Her financial issues are current \nand ongoing. AG \u00b6 20(a) is not applicable.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial difficulties were partly caused by her periods of \nunemployment and underemployment. She also lost income when she was placed on \nbed rest before the birth of her twins. These qualify as conditions that were outside her \ncontrol. To be fully applicable, AG \u00b6 20(b) also requires that the individual act \nresponsibly under the circumstances. Applicant acted responsibly when she brought her \ncar loan current and she started paying back the deficiency owed on a car loan after her \ntruck was voluntarily repossessed. However, she stopped the payments while she was \non bed rest, and they have not yet resumed. She was unable to maintain her car loan \npayments, and another car was repossessed. I am unable to determine that she has \nacted completely responsibly under the circumstances. AG \u00b6 20(b) is partially \napplicable.  \n \n \nApplicant did not receive financial counseling as of the date of the hearing, but \nshe has researched a well-known financial expert and she plans on attending classes at \na local church. That is a good start. Applicant clearly can benefit from counseling and \nadvice on how to manage her money. However, at this point, her finances are not being \nresolved and are not under control. Her limited payments to date are insufficient to \nsupport a finding that she has made a good-faith effort to pay or otherwise resolve her \ndebts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) are not applicable.  \n\n \n7 \n \n \nApplicant has not formally disputed any of the debts she denied owing. However, \nher testimony about the disputed debts was credible. AG \u00b6 20(d) is applicable to the \ndebts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, 1.d, 1.f, and 1.l through 1.r. It is not applicable to the \ndebt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g, because she admitted she had cellular telephone service \nwith the provider and she terminated the service before the end of the contract.  \n \n \nAt this point, Applicant\u2019s finances remain a concern despite the presence of \nsome mitigation. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.       \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment.  \n \nI considered Applicant\u2019s favorable character evidence. I also found Applicant to \nbe honest and candid about her finances. I believe she is sincere about getting her \nfinances in order. However, she is not close to reaching that point, as evidenced by her \ncar being repossessed while she was in the process of attempting to pay the deficiency \nowed on her truck that was repossessed. Applicant is a good and valued employee. \nHopefully her company will maintain her position until her finances are more conducive \nto the holding of a security clearance.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the Financial Considerations security concerns.  \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant  \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c-1.d: \n \nFor Applicant  \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \nFor Applicant  \nSubparagraphs 1.g-1.k: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.l-1.r: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nEdward W.

Eligibility \nfor access to classified information is denied.  \n \nOn July 20, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline \nF, Financial Considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on August 6, 2009, and elected to have \nthe case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel \nsubmitted the government\u2019s written case on August 28, 2009. A complete copy of the \nfile of relevant material (FORM) was provided to Applicant, who was afforded an \nopportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the \nNovember 17, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \nsecurity concerns. Applicant received the FORM on September 7, 2009. He responded \nto the FORM on September 15, 2009. Department Counsel did not object to his \nresponse. The case was assigned to me on September 30, 2009.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 53-year-old engineer for a defense contractor. He has worked for \nhis current employer since September 2008. He served in the military from 1975 to \n1978, and was honorably discharged. He had a security clearance at the company \nwhere he worked from 1986 to 2005. He is seeking to obtain a security clearance \nthrough his current employer after being unemployed from 2005 through September \n2008. He has a bachelor\u2019s degree, awarded in 1984. He was married from 1975 until his \ndivorce in 1984. He married again in 1990. He has two children, ages 33 and 15.1  \n \n \nThe SOR alleges nine delinquent debts, as listed on a credit report obtained on \nOctober 10, 2008. Applicant admitted all the allegations, with the exception of the debts \nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.d, and 1.e, which he denied. The six debts that Applicant \nadmitted owing total about $129,838.  \n \n \nApplicant has experienced financial problems for a number of years. In a 2002 \nstatement provided for his background investigation, he discussed his finances and \nwrote \u201c[o]ver time we irresponsibly accumulated over $70,000 in credit card debt.\u201d He \ncontracted with a debt management company to assist in resolving his debts in 2002. \nApplicant and the company approximated his debt at $79,000. He agreed to pay the \ncompany 15% of the amount of his debt, which amounted to $11,850, to manage his \ndebt. The contract called for him to make monthly payments to the company for 23 \nmonths before their fee would be paid. The company agreed to negotiate settlements \nwith his creditors.2  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s ability to pay his delinquent debts was hampered by his three years of \nunemployment. He lost his job of almost 20 years after multiple leaves of absence to \ncare for his sick parents. Both parents are now deceased.3 \n \n \nApplicant denied owing the delinquent medical debts of $233 (SOR \u00b6 1.c) and \n$72 (SOR \u00b6 1.i). He did not recognize the creditors named in the SOR. The names of \nthe original medical providers are not included on the credit reports submitted.4  \n \n \nThree of Applicant\u2019s debts were reduced to judgments. In 2005, he satisfied the \n$5,360 judgment alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. There is no evidence of payments of any of the \nother debts. Applicant did not submit any information on how he is planning to address \n                                                          \n1 Item 5.  \n \n2 Items 5, 8, 9. \n \n3 Item 5; Applicant\u2019s response to FORM. \n \n4 Items 4, 6, 7; Applicant\u2019s response to FORM. \n \n\n \n3 \n \nhis delinquent debts, except he asked the question: \u201cWould bankruptcy help me in any \nway with my clearance?\u201d5 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \n                                                          \n5 Items 4, 5; Applicant\u2019s response to FORM. \n \n\n \n4 \n \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant accumulated a number of delinquent debts and was unable or unwilling \nto pay his obligations for a period of time. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above \ndisqualifying conditions. \n \n \n  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control;  \n \n\n \n5 \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nApplicant has not resolved most of the debts alleged in the SOR. His financial \nissues are recent and ongoing. AG \u00b6 20(a) is not applicable.  \n \n \nApplicant admitted that he \u201cirresponsibly accumulated over $70,000 in credit card \ndebt.\u201d In 2002, he contracted with a debt management company to pay them $11,850 to \nmanage his debts of $79,000. One debt that was reduced to judgment was satisfied in \n2005. He lost his job of almost 20 years after multiple leaves of absence to care for his \nsick parents. His unemployment hindered his ability to pay his delinquent debts. No \nother debts have been paid. Applicant\u2019s unemployment and his parents\u2019 medical \nproblems could qualify as conditions that were outside his control. To be fully \napplicable, AG \u00b6 20(b) also requires that the individual act responsibly under the \ncircumstances. Much of his debts were accrued before his unemployment. There is no \ninformation as to what actions he took while he was unemployed. There is insufficient \nevidence in the record for a finding that he acted responsibly. AG \u00b6 20(b) has minimal \napplicability.  \n \n \nApplicant has received financial counseling, but there is insufficient evidence for \na determination that his financial problems are being resolved or under control. AG \u00b6 \n20(c) is partially applicable.  \n \n \nApplicant satisfied one judgment. AG \u00b6 20(d) is applicable to that debt. That \npayment does not support a finding that he made a good-faith effort to pay or resolve all \nhis delinquent debts. AG \u00b6 20(d) is not applicable to the unpaid debts. \n \n \nApplicant denied owing the two small delinquent medical debts. He did not \nrecognize the creditors named in the SOR. The names of the original medical providers \nare not included on the credit reports. He admitted to owing more than about $129,000. \nApplicant established that he has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the two \npast-due medical debts. AG \u00b6 20(e) is applicable to those debts.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \n\n \n6 \n \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is 53 years old. He \naccumulated a large amount of debt, which he admitted was because of his \nirresponsibility. He was unemployed for three years after he lost his longtime job after \nmultiple leaves of absence to care for his sick parents. It is unclear from the minimal \ninformation in the record as to what actions he took while he was unemployed. He \ncurrently owes more than $129,000. There is not enough evidence in the record for me \nto conclude that his finances are in order.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated Financial Considerations security concerns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.b-1.c: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.d-1.e: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.f-1.i: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n                                               \n \n \n \n________________________ \nEdward W. Loughran \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Duffy, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nCURRY, Marc E., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant mitigated the Government\u2019s security concerns generated by his\nfinancial delinquencies and his omission of financial information from his security\nclearance application. Clearance is granted.\nStatement of the Case\nOn October 13, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant. The action was taken under\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February\n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended\n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG).\nOn October 28, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR, admitting the allegations in\nSOR Paragraph 1 and denying the allegations in SOR Paragraph 2. He requested a\ndecision without a hearing. On November 9, 2009, Department Counsel prepared a File\nJune 29, 2010\n\n2\nof Relevant Material (FORM), and DOHA mailed it to Applicant. He received it on\nNovember 20, 2009, along with instructions to file any objections or supplementary\ninformation within 30 days. Applicant did not provide any additional information. The\ncase was assigned to me on February 4, 2010. \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 53-year-old married man with two adult children. In 1980, he\nearned a bachelor of science degree in electrical engineering. He has worked for the\nsame employer, a defense contractor, since 1991. Currently, he is a senior quality\nanalyst.\nIn 2005, Applicant and his wife purchased a home, but underestimated the true\ncost of owning a house in addition to their mortgage. Also, their car broke down at or\nabout the time of the home purchase, requiring approximately $2,000 of repairs.\nConsequently, they were unable to balance the car expenses and the home\u2019s operating\ncosts. (Item 6 at 5) By August 2008, Applicant began falling behind on his mortgage\npayments. (Item 9 at 2) By the time Applicant completed his security clearance\napplication in October 2008, he was approximately 60 days behind on his mortgage\npayments. (Item 10 at 8)\nBetween 2000 and 2005, Applicant cosigned two student loans for his daughter,\nand cosigned a car loan for his son. Also during that time, he opened two credit card\naccounts with his wife. Subsequently, his children defaulted on their loans, and his wife\ncharged multiple expenses on the credit cards without his knowledge. (Item 10 at 4-6)\nAfter discovering the charges his wife had accrued, and the loans on which his\nchildren had defaulted, Applicant began contacting creditors and arranging payment\nplans. By May 2009, he had satisfied the delinquent credit card accounts and his\ndaughter\u2019s student loan accounts, totalling approximately $11,500. (Item 7 at 8; Item 9\nat 2) Those debts are not alleged in the SOR.\nIn 2004, Applicant cosigned a car loan for his son, as listed in SOR\nsubparagraph 1.a. (Item 6 at 3) His son then \u201cdisappeared\u201d for the next three years. (Id.)\nApplicant did not know the location of either his son or the car during this time. It is\nunknown from the record why Applicant\u2019s son lost contact with him. In 2007, Applicant\nlocated his son and discovered that he had stopped making car payments during the\nperiod when his whereabouts were unknown. Applicant did not know the exact date\nwhen Applicant had stopped making car payments. \nShortly after locating his son, Applicant arranged for the car\u2019s voluntary\nrepossession. (Item 6 at 3) The SOR lists a deficiency of $13,074. Applicant denies that\nthere is any outstanding deficiency. In support of this contention, he references a\nconversation with a representative of the creditor, but does not provide any\ncorroborating evidence. (Item 4 at 2)\n\nIn the last 7 years, have you been over 180 days delinquent on any debt(s)?\n1\nAre you currently over 90 days delinquent on any debt(s)?\n2\n3\nApplicant\u2019s mortgage delinquency is alleged in SOR subparagraph 1.b. In August\n2009, Applicant contacted the mortgagee and negotiated a loan modification. (Item 4 at\n6) Under the terms of Applicant\u2019s modified home loan, his monthly payment decreased\nby $60 monthly, and his delinquency was consolidated into the adjusted principal. He\nwas to begin making payments per the new mortgage beginning October 2009.\nApplicant contends he paid the first mortgage payment, but did not provide any\ncorroborating evidence. (Item 4 at 3)\nApplicant maintains a budget. He earns $91,000 per year. He has approximately\n$489 of monthly, disposable income. Also, he has $1,000 in savings, and $500 invested\nin the stock market. (Item 7 at 4) He has not attended any financial counseling since\nexperiencing his financial difficulties. (Item 6 at 5) However, he has removed his wife\nfrom his personal checking and savings accounts. (Item 4 at 2)\nThe Government contends Applicant intentionally omitted his mortgage\ndelinquency in response to Section 28a of his security clearance application.  Also, the\n1\nGovernment contends Applicant intentionally omitted the automobile deficiency and the\nnon-alleged debts from his security clearance application in response to Section 28b.  \n2\nApplicant\u2019s mortgage was no more than 60 days behind when he completed the\nsecurity clearance application. Department Counsel acknowledges that the Government\nhas no evidence establishing that the non-alleged debts were his responsibility. (FORM\nat 7)\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief\nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially\ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied together with the factors\nlisted in the adjudicative process. The protection of the national security is the\nparamount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel\nbeing considered for access to classified information will be resolved in favor of national\nsecurity.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\n\n4\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\nAnalysis\nFinancial Considerations\nUnder this guideline, \u201cfailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information.\u201d\n(AG \u00b6 18) Applicant\u2019s history of financial delinquencies triggers the application of AG \u00b6\n19(a), \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not\nmeeting financial obligations.\u201d\nThe following mitigating conditions set forth in AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable:\n20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n20(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control; and\n20(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts. \nNearly all of Applicant\u2019s delinquent debt arose because his family members\neither failed to make payments on loans for which he had cosigned, or spent money on\njoint credit card accounts without his knowledge. These problems contributed to his\ntrouble making his mortgage payments on time.\nBy May 2009, Applicant had satisfied approximately $11,500 of delinquent debt.\nThree months later, he successfully negotiated a mortgage loan modification. It is no\nlonger in delinquent status. Applicant\u2019s contention that he owes no automobile\ndeficiency as a result of the voluntary repossession of the car he cosigned for his son is\nnot supported by corroborating documentary evidence. Nevertheless, I conclude this\ncontention is credible in light of his substantiated efforts to satisfy his other\ndelinquencies.\nAlthough Applicant did not meet with a financial counselor after he began\nstruggling with his debt, he maintains a budget and has ample income to satisfy his\nmortgage payments and prevent a recurrence of his financial problems. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b),\n20(c), and 20(d) apply.\n\n5\nPersonal Conduct\nThe security concern under this guideline is as follows:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nApplicant\u2019s response to Section 28 of his security clearance application raises the issue\nof whether AG \u00b6 16(a), \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant\nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar\nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award\nbenefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award\nfiduciary responsibilities,\u201d applies.\nThe Government alleges Applicant deliberately falsified his security clearance\napplication by omitting his delinquent mortgage payments, four non-alleged\ndelinquencies, and the deficiency from a repossessed automobile. Applicant was only\n60 days behind on his mortgage payments when he completed the security clearance\napplication, and the Government presented no evidence that his mortgage payments\nhad ever been more than 180 days late. Consequently, Applicant did not falsify Section\n28 by omitting his mortgage delinquency.\nDepartment Counsel acknowledged the Government had no evidence refuting\nApplicant\u2019s contention that the non-alleged debts were not his responsibility. I conclude\nApplicant\u2019s omission of these non-alleged debts does not constitute falsification.\nCreditors typically notify cosigners when the primary obligee defaults on loan\npayments. In this case, however, Applicant relocated at or about the same time that his\nson disappeared and stopped making car payments. This calls into question whether\nApplicant received notice of his son\u2019s default from the creditor. Under these\ncircumstances, Applicant\u2019s contention that he did not know when his son stopped\nmaking car payments is credible. Consequently, Applicant\u2019s omission of this debt from\nSection 28a of the security clearance application requiring him to disclose whether he\nhad been more than 180 days late on a debt in the past seven years does not constitute\na falsification.\nI conclude that none of the disqualifying conditions apply, and Applicant did not\nintentionally falsify his security clearance application. There are no Personal Conduct\nsecurity concerns.\n\n6\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nApplicant\u2019s financial problems stemmed mainly from delinquencies accrued by\nfamily members on accounts that were either jointly in his name, or for which he had\ncosigned. His mortgage payments fell behind because he underestimated the actual\ncosts of owning a home. Applicant has taken multiple steps to rehabilitate his finances,\nincluding obtaining a loan modification to reduce his mortgage and satisfying\napproximately $11,500 of debt that his family members accrued. Given Applicant\u2019s\nstable income, I conclude the possibility of recurrence of financial problems is minimal.  \nThe circumstances under which Applicant discovered that the car loan he\ncosigned for his son had become delinquent were highly unusual. Consequently, his\ncontention that he did not know exactly when the car payments became delinquent was\nplausible. In assessing Applicant\u2019s credibility, I also considered his history of job\nstability, the circumstances beyond his control that led to his financial problems, and the\nresponsible manner in which he satisfied debts accrued by family members in his name,\nonce he discovered them. Upon considering this case in the context of the whole-\nperson concept, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\n\n7\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                             \nMARC E. CURRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his Answer to the SOR, the Applicant admitted the factual allegations in all of the allegations of SOR, with explanations. The Applicant is retired from the Navy, and during his periods of deployment, his former spouse was tasked with handling their bills (TR at page 27 line 9 to page 31 line 8, at page 75 line 24 to page 76 line 10, and at page 88 lines 12~23). For the most part, she did not pay their debts in a timely fashion, but rather gambled away much of their income (Id). During their two year period of a legal separation, pending their divorce in November of 2003, unbeknownst to the Applicant, she continued to run up bills and acquire new debt in the Applicant\u2019s name (TR at page 27 line 9 to page 31 line 8, at page 75 line 24 to page 76 line 10, and at page 88 lines 12~23, and GX 1 at page 18). This conduct resulted in the Applicant\u2019s current financial difficulties. 1.z.

Freeman, Esquire\nFebruary 24, 2010\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nCEFOLA, Richard A., Administrative Judge:\nThe Applicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations\nProcessing (e-QIP), on October 17, 2008.  On June 18, 2009, the Defense Office of\nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the\nsecurity concerns under Guideline F for the Applicant.  The action was taken under\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February\n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended\n(Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President\non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs\nissued after September 1, 2006. \nThe Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on July 3, 2009.  He answered\nthe SOR in writing on July 8, 2009, and requested a hearing before an Administrative\nJudge.  DOHA received the request on July 13, 2009, and I received the case\nassignment on July 31, 2009.  DOHA issued a notice of hearing on August 12, 2009,\nand I convened the hearing as scheduled on September 15, 2009.  The Government\n\n2\noffered Exhibits (GXs) 1 through 9, which were received without objection.  The\nApplicant testified on his own behalf, as did his Supervisor, and submitted Exhibits\n(AppXs) A and B, without objection.  DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (TR)\non September 23, 2009.  I granted the Applicant\u2019s request to keep the record open until\nOctober 13, 2009, to submit additional matters.  On October 13, 2009, he submitted\nExhibits C through L, without objection.  As the undersigned had jury duty on October\n13 and 14, 2009, the record closed on October 15, 2009.  Based upon a review of the\ncase file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, the Applicant admitted the factual allegations in all of\nthe allegations of SOR, with explanations.\nThe Applicant is retired from the Navy, and during his periods of deployment, his\nformer spouse was tasked with handling their bills (TR at page 27 line 9 to page 31 line\n8, at page 75 line 24 to page 76 line 10, and at page 88 lines 12~23).  For the most\npart, she did not pay their debts in a timely fashion, but rather gambled away much of\ntheir income (Id).  During their two year period of a legal separation, pending their\ndivorce in November of 2003, unbeknownst to the Applicant, she continued to run up\nbills and acquire new debt in the Applicant\u2019s name (TR at page 27 line 9 to page 31 line\n8, at page 75 line 24 to page 76 line 10, and at page 88 lines 12~23, and GX 1 at page\n18).

This debt is to Creditor M in the amount of about $593.

The Applicant\ndisputes this debt as not being his, and avers credibly that, in speaking with the creditor,\nthey have no record of this debt (TR at page 45 line 15 to page 46 line 13, at page 77\nline 10 to page 79 line 24).

In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\n\n5\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law.  Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process.  The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision.  According to\nParagraph 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables\nknown as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d  The administrative judge must consider all\navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and\nunfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.\nParagraph 2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for\naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d  In\nreaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical\nand based on the evidence contained in the record.  Likewise, I have avoided drawing\ninferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive Paragraph E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to\nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR.  Under Directive Paragraph E3.1.15,\nthe Applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut,\nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department\nCounsel. . . .\u201d  The Applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a\nfavorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.  This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours.  The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration\nof the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information.  Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d  See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).\nAnalysis\nGuideline F - Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in Paragraph 18:\n\n6\nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and\nmeet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment,\nor unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information.  An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns.  Under\nSubparagraph 19(a), an \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially\ndisqualifying.  Similarly under Subparagraph 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial\nobligations@ may raise security concerns.  During his marriage, and during his legal\nseparation from his, now, former spouse, the Applicant was saddled with her delinquent\ndebts.\nThese are clearly countered by the Mitigating Conditions found in Subparagraphs\n20(b) and 20 (d).  Under Subparagraph 20(b), it may be mitigating where \u201cthe conditions\nthat resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., . . .\ndivorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@\nFurthermore, Subparagraph 20(d) applies where the evidence shows \u201cthe individual\ninitiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.@  The\nAppellant\u2019s former spouse would rather gamble than pay their debts; and as a result, he\nbecame responsible for the past due indebtedness.  The Applicant, with little help from\nhis former spouse, has made a good faith effort to address all of the alleged past due\ndebts.  In fact, he has paid, or resolved, all of the alleged past due debts.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances.  Under Paragraph 2(c), the ultimate determination of\nwhether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense\njudgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person\nconcept.  Here, he has the unqualified support of his Supervisor, and of his Team Lead\n(TR at page 22 line 14 to page 25 line 12, and AppX B).\nThe Administrative Judge should also consider the nine adjudicative process\nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\n\n7\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nI considered all of the evidence, including the potentially disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions surrounding this case.  Overall, the record evidence leaves me\nwithout questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security\nclearance.  For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns\narising from his financial considerations.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.I:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.n:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.o:\nFor Applicant\n\n8\nSubparagraph 1.p:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.q:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.r:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.s:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.t:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.u:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.v:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.w:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.x:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.y:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.z:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised \nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \nOn May 29, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR. He admitted all 21 of the \nallegations raised in the SOR, representing an approximate sum of $46,600 in \ndelinquent debt and balances equaling about $7,400 on past due accounts. He also \nrequested a hearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge. I was assigned the case on \nSeptember 28, 2009. The parties proposed an October 21, 2009, hearing. A Notice of \nHearing was issued designating an October 20, 2009, hearing date. It was amended on \nOctober 6, 2009, to reflect the originally contemplated hearing date. \nDecember 7, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n                                           \nThe hearing took place as scheduled. Applicant gave testimony and offered six \ndocuments, which I accepted into the record without objection as Exhibits (Exs.) A - F.  \nAlso accepted without objection were five documents from Department Counsel, \nmarked as Exs. 1 - 5. Applicant was given through November 16, 2009, to submit any \nadditional materials. The transcript (Tr.) was received on October 29, 2009. On \nNovember 16, 2009, Applicant timely submitted five additional documents, accepted \nwithout objection as Exs. G - K. On November 20, 2009, an eleventh document was \nsubmitted by Applicant through Department Counsel, who declined to object to the \nsubmission. It was accepted into the record as Ex. L and the record was closed. Based \nupon a review of the case file, exhibits, and testimony, security clearance is denied. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 42-year-old security officer who has worked for the same defense \ncontractor since May 2008. He has earned a high school diploma. He is married and \nhas three children, ages 21, 16, and 15.    \n \nBetween March 2006 and May 2006, Applicant was unemployed after he was let \ngo from a position as a special police officer. He had held that position for about three \nyears. During his period of unemployment, he used some of his savings to meet his \nexpenses. He then worked as a supervisor for another security-related entity from May \n2006 until early January 2008. Because he believed he was about to be terminated, \nApplicant resigned from his position because he \u201cdidn\u2019t want to mess [his] clearance \nup.\u201d1 He remained unemployed through May 2008. During this latter period of \nunemployment, Applicant did not apply for unemployment compensation or benefits \nbecause he \u201cdidn\u2019t want to get complacent and get comfortable with getting that check \nin and not going to work, so I got up every morning, I got a newspaper, and I went out \nhere, there and everywhere, and put applications in.\u201d2 He exhausted his savings while \nmeeting his monthly obligations.3 After he was hired by his current employer in May \n2008, Applicant tried to address his recently accumulated debt. It was the first time \nsince he first used credit in 1996 that he was unable to timely meet his debts.4 He \nsought the assistance of a law firm and a debt consolidation entity to help him sort out \nhis financial situation, but eventually discontinued using their services when he decided \nthey were yielding few, if any, results.  \n \nThe accounts at issue in the SOR reflect nearly $18,000 in delinquent debt. The \nSOR also shows that Applicant is past due on several accounts with cumulative \nbalances of approximately $7,000. In addition, an adverse judgment for approximately \n \n   1 Tr. 75.  \n \n   2 Tr. 73-74.  \n \n   3 Tr. 19.  \n \n   4 Tr. 20.  \n \n\n \n3 \n \n                                           \n$29,000 is noted at SOR allegation \u00b6 1.u.  Through Applicant\u2019s efforts, he negotiated a \nsettlement for $1,159.60 on a total account balance of about $2,899 to satisfy one debt \n(SOR \u00b6 1.d).5 On the day of the hearing, Applicant testified he was prepared to satisfy a \nnegotiated settlement of $735.33 on a debt with a balance of approximately $1,223 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.e.ii).6 That account was ultimately settled in November 2009.7 He also \nsatisfied an account balance charged off in the approximate amount of $2,537 (SOR \u00b6 \n1.f) with a settlement payment received by the creditor on or about October 28, 2009.8 \n \nApplicant also accepted a settlement offer to pay $440.42 to satisfy a collection \naccount balance of $978.71 (SOR \u00b6 1.g).9 Applicant testified that he paid this balance, \nbut failed to produce evidence the offer was paid. Applicant also stated he satisfied a \nbalance with a medical provider secured in a judgment against him for $1,120 (SOR \u00b6 \n1.l),10 but he provided no evidence linking the medical provider with the party securing \nthe judgment against him. Similarly, Applicant accepted a settlement offer to pay \n$875.77 on a telecommunications account balance of about $1,459.61, which was \nnoted in his credit report as having been past due in the approximate amount of $132. \n(SOR \u00b6 1.m).11 Again, however, he failed to provide evidence of payment.  \n \nApplicant received an overpayment of approximately $1,000 on an annuity he \nhad sold to a third party (SOR \u00b6 1.u).12 A judgment was secured against Applicant by \nthe third party to preserve its rights for the annuity sums. He stated that an arrangement \nwas made under which future payments would be diverted directly to the third party and \nthe overpayment would be satisfied, but provided no direct documentary evidence that \nthis arrangement was executed.13 Applicant provided sufficient circumstantial evidence \nto convince the government that the related adverse judgment for approximately \n$29,000 was met and the evidence confirms this conclusion.14  \n \n   5 Ex.

That account represents the purchase \nof computer-related items financed through the creditor noted at SOR \u00b6 1.e.i.15 He \nstated payments will start in November 2009. He also stated payments would start in \nNovember 2009 on the delinquent account noted at SOR \u00b6 1.t for about $1,681.16 \nApplicant failed, however, to provide evidence demonstrating records of payment on \nthose accounts. \n \nApplicant has devised a plan under which he hopes ultimately to be debt free by \nJune 2010.17 To accomplish this goal, he is currently working two jobs and saving \navailable funds to devote toward his debt.18 He has allotted approximately $1,500 per \nmonth to devote to his delinquent debts.19 Under his plan, he is first addressing his \ncredit card accounts, negotiating settlement balances where possible. After eliminating \nthose debts, he intends to address the remaining accounts, which are essentially for \nlesser amounts. \u201cI wanted to clear the credit cards up first, to pay them all off. And then \nwith the phone bills, the majority have not been that much, I can come back and knock \nthem out way quicker that [sic] I can get these paid off.\u201d20  He employed a law firm to \nhelp him handle his debts in the past, but it was unproductive. On November 19, 2009, \nApplicant received financial counseling that resulted in an analysis of his financial \nsituation and proposed strategies for addressing his debt.21 Regarding his financial \nsituation, Applicant stated: \u201cyour name and your credit\u2019s all you have and, like I said, \nprior to me losing my job I never had credit issue [sic] since 1996 and I just want to get \nback and put my name back in good faith.\u201d22  \n \nAt present, Applicant is current on all of his monthly obligations, including car \npayments, utilities, and child support. He may owe about $2,000 for unpaid taxes dating \nback to 2007, but that issue has not been resolved.23 His wife is a police officer who \nearns about $40,000 to $45,000 a year. \n \n \n  15 Tr. 62-64. \n \n  16 Tr. 64-65. \n \n  17 Tr. 68-69. \n \n  18 Tr. 72. \n \n  19 Tr. 77. \n \n  20 Tr. 69. \n \n  21 Ex.

In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. The guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthey are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. Under AG \u00b6 2(c), this process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d Consideration must be given to all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \n\u00b6 2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d  \n \nIn reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are \nreasonable, logical and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have \navoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. The \nGovernment must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. \nAn applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, \nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department \nCounsel. . . .\u201d24 The burden of proof is something less than a preponderance of \nevidence.25 The ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision \nis on the applicant.26  \n  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information.  \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d EO 12968, Section 3.1(b), lists multiple prerequisites for access to \nclassified or sensitive information. The Appeal Board has stated that \u201c(t)he clearly \n \n   24 See also ISCR Case No. 94-1075 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, 1995). \n \n   25 Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \n \n   26 ISCR Case No. 93-1390 at 7-8 (App. Bd. Jan. 27, 1995). \n \n\n \n6 \n \nconsistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they \nmust, on the side of denials.\u201d27 Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant \nshould be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of \nprotecting such sensitive information.28  The decision to deny an individual a security \nclearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.29 It is \nmerely an indication that an applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and \nthe Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance. \n \nBased upon consideration of the evidence, I find the following adjudicative \nguideline to be the most pertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case: \n \nGuideline F \u2013 Financial Considerations. The Concern: Failure or inability to live \nwithin one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-\ncontrol, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified information. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having \nto engage in illegal acts to generate funds.30  \n \nConditions pertaining to this adjudicative guideline that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying, as well as those that would mitigate security \nconcerns, are set forth and discussed in the conclusions below. \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nApplicant admitted he had numerous delinquent debts that were noted on his \ncredit report and in the SOR. The accounts at issue reflected nearly $18,000 in \ndelinquent debt, several past due accounts, and a judgment for approximately $29,000.  \nTherefore, Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) AG \u00b6 19(a) \n(inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and FC DC AG \u00b6 19 (c) (a history of not \nmeeting financial obligations) apply. With such conditions raised, the burden shifts to \nApplicant to overcome the case against him and mitigate security concerns.  \n \nApplicant attributes the majority of the delinquent debts at issue to a period of \nunemployment in 2008. It was his second period of unemployment since early 2006. He \ndid not apply for unemployment compensation in 2008 and it is unclear whether he \nsimply quit his position or was constructively terminated. There is no evidence \ndemonstrating attempts to manage his growing debts while he was unemployed or to \nseek financial counselling to help him at that time. Given these facts, Financial \nConsiderations Mitigating Condition (FC MC) AG \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior happened so \nlong ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to \n                                            \n   27 Id. \n \n   28 Id. \n \n   29 Executive Order 10865 \u00a7 7. \n \n   30 AG \u00b6 18. \n\n \n7 \n \nrecur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment) does not apply.   \n \nApplicant stressed that he did not seek unemployment compensation in 2008, \nalthough the facts indicate that he quit his position of his own volition. Regardless, this \nvolitional act obviates applicability of Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition (FC \nMC) AG \u00b6 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the \nperson\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation) and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances). \n \nAlthough Applicant received financial counselling, that counselling was received \nafter the hearing. Therefore, there is no indication it has helped him address the debts \nat issue. On the other hand, he satisfied approximately $7,000 of about $18,000 in \ndelinquent debt by settling the debts noted at SOR allegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.e.ii, and 1.f. He \nalso presented sufficient evidence to show that the judgment noted at SOR allegation \u00b6 \n1.u for approximately $29,000 has been addressed. Consequently, Applicant provided \nsufficient evidence to show that he has successfully resolved a significant portion of the \ndebt at issue. Therefore, FC MC AG \u00b6 20(c) (the person has received or is receiving \ncounseling for the problem and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control) and FC MC AG \u00b6 20(d), (the individual initiated a good-faith \neffort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts) apply.  \n \nNo evidence was submitted showing that any accounts were formally disputed \nwith a credit reporting bureau or are disputed based on a reasonable basis that the debt \nat issue is not owed. Consequently, FC MC AG \u00b6 20(e) (the individual has a reasonable \nbasis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem \nand provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue) does not apply. Moreover, FC MC AG \u00b6 20(f) \n(the affluence resulted from a legal source of income) is not applicable. \n \nIn total, the SOR allegations set forth approximately $53,000 in delinquent debts, \npast due accounts, and judgments. In the three months between his receipt of the SOR \nand the hearing, Applicant satisfied approximately $7,000 in delinquent debts and \npresented evidence that the judgment for approximately $29,000 was resolved. \nConsequently, over two-thirds of the debt at issue, including the total balances on \naccounts that were merely past due for lesser amounts, have been addressed. His \nstrategy for paying off his debts was recently complemented by financial counselling, \nwhich provided him with suggested strategies for more efficiently addressing his \nremaining debts. Much work, however, remains to be accomplished. Applicant failed to \nsubstantiate his claims that some of his accounts already have been addressed. Some \nof his accounts lack evidence demonstrating Applicant has initiated any efforts toward \nworking with his creditors. More importantly, nearly $17,000 composed of both \ndelinquent and past due accounts remain outstanding. While Applicant demonstrated \nboth diligence and good faith in addressing the accounts at issue in the past few \nmonths, the amount remaining at issue is sufficiently significant to sustain the security \nconcerns previously identified in the SOR.  \n\n \n8 \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. In reviewing the complete record, I \nconsidered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts \nand circumstances surrounding this case, as well as the \u201cwhole person\u201d factors noted \nabove. Applicant is a highly credible man who depleted his personal savings during a \n2006 period of unemployment. Lacking sufficient financial reserves when he was \nunemployed in 2008, he acquired significant delinquent debt in about five months. To \nhis credit, he has addressed over two-thirds of the amount at issue in three months.  \n \nAdditional factors speak in his favor. He earned a high school diploma and has \nraised three children. He has been current on his child support. Applicant has had a \nsuccessful career in his chosen profession. When unemployed, he actively pursued new \njob opportunities. He is current on his on-going obligations. Applicant developed a \nlogical and apparently successful strategy for addressing his delinquent debts. \nMoreover, he recently received financial counseling that should help him address those \nremaining debts in a more expeditious efficient manner.  \n \nWhile Applicant demonstrated diligence in addressing the accounts at issue, \nconsiderable work remains to be done. Accounts representing approximately $17,000 in \ndebt remain at issue. While Applicant stated he paid the accounts noted at SOR \nallegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.g, 1.l, 1.m, 1.e.i, and 1.t, no evidence was presented substantiating this \nclaim. No evidence was presented showing that Applicant has yet addressed the \nremaining accounts at issue. Lacking a concerted effort to satisfy all the accounts at \nissue, or at least initiate and document contact with all of his creditors, security \nconcerns remain regarding Applicant\u2019s ability to sustain his recent efforts. While \nApplicant expressed his commitment to continue addressing his debts until all are \nsatisfied, the Appeal Board has long held that promises to pay in the future are \ninsufficient to mitigate security concerns arising from outstanding delinquent debts. \nConsequently, it would be premature to conclude that Applicant\u2019s recent efforts mitigate \nsecurity concerns. Clearance is denied. \n\n \n9 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e.i:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e.ii  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.i:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.j:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.k:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.l:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.m:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.n:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.o:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.p:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.q:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.r:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.s:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.t:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.u:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On December 7, 2009, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Arthur E.\nMarshall, Jr., granted Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Department Counsel appealed\npursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nDepartment Counsel raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s treatment of\nthe pertinent mitigating conditions is erroneous and whether the Judge\u2019s whole-person analysis is\nerroneous.

Some of the\ndebts alleged in the SOR are judgments against Applicant.  She did not go to court regarding these\njudgments, because she felt overwhelmed.  \nApplicant currently has a budget.  Her take-home pay is $2,100 per month, plus $300 - $400\nfrom a second job.  However, her monthly expenses run to just under $2,500 per month.\nIn the Analysis portion of the decision, the Judge noted that Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts\n\u201cremain virtually unaddressed today[.]\u201d Id. at 8.  He also noted that \u201cno tangible efforts have been\ndemonstrated or documented regarding the past due accounts at issue.\u201d  Id. at 9.  However, he\nattributed the debts to Applicant\u2019s traumatic experiences and concluded that the security concerns\nin her case had been mitigated.\nDiscussion\nA Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation\nfor\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs.

Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.32.3 and E3.1.33.3.\nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong\npresumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.  See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913\nF. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  After the Government presents\nth\nevidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut or mitigate those\nconcerns.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  \u201cThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and\nwhole person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the\nparticular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires the exercise of sound discretion in light\nof the record evidence as a whole.\u201d  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-03635 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20,\n2006).\nIn deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, the Board\nwill review the Judge's decision to determine whether:  it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails\nto articulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between\n\nDirective \u00b6 E2.20(a): \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\n2\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not case doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness,\nor good judgement[.]\u201d\nDirective \u00b6 E2.20(b): \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s\n3\ncontrol . . . and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances[.]\u201d \n \nSee Department Counsel Brief at 8: \u201cApplicant also testified that she met with a bankruptcy attorney after\n4\nseeing the financial counselor.  The record reflects no action taken after this meeting, no preparation for filing, no filing,\nand no approval of bankruptcy.\u201d  (internal citations omitted) The Judge left the record open for Applicant to submit\nadditional matters.  She submitted a letter from a registered nurse attesting that Applicant had received outpatient\npsychiatric services.  However, she did not submit any documents to substantiate her testimony about her proposed\nbankruptcy filing.  Neither did she submit a copy of a budget, although at the hearing she intimated that she would do\nso.  Tr. at 91.\n  \n4\nthe facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of\njudgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision\nthat runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere\ndifference of opinion.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law,\nthe Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of Executive Order 10865, the\nDirective, or other applicable federal law.  See ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2,\n2006).\nAlthough the Judge properly concluded that Applicant\u2019s case raised security concerns under\nGuideline F, Department Counsel argues that the Judge erred in concluding that the record as a\nwhole is sufficient to mitigate these concerns.  Department Counsel\u2019s argument has merit.  \nThe Judge extended favorable application to two Financial Considerations Mitigating\nConditions (FCMC),  20(a)  and 20(b).   We note the untoward events and tragedies in Applicant\u2019s\n2\n3\npersonal history, which was evidence the Judge was required to consider.  However, as Department\nCounsel points out, Applicant\u2019s delinquencies actually began around the year 2000, well prior to her\nson\u2019s horrific death, and they continued unabated through the close of the record, more than five\nyears after his death.  Accordingly, the disqualifying behavior did not only occur \u201clong ago\u201d within\nthe meaning of FCMC 20(a).  See ISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008), quoting\nISCR Case No. 01-03695 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002) (Failure to discharge debts \u201cis a continuing\ncourse of conduct[.]\u201d) Under the circumstances, the record does not support a conclusion that\nApplicant has met her burden of persuasion that her debts are not recent.  Furthermore, the ongoing\nnature of her debts undermines her contention that the debts are not likely to recur.  Given that her\ndelinquencies span the better part of a decade and given the Judge\u2019s own finding that she has taken\nno action in regard to them, the record evidence cannot support a conclusion that her conduct of\nsecurity concern is behind her.  Although Applicant states that she is considering filing for\nbankruptcy protection, there is little evidence in the record of any concrete steps she has taken\ntoward this goal or whether it is simply an inchoate plan for possible future action.     \n4\n\n\u201cBefore counseling, she found it exceptionally difficult to manage and document even the basics regarding her\n5\nfinances.\u201d  Decision at 5.  See also Applicant\u2019s testimony about her lack of financial understanding: \u201cMy first experience\nwith paying a bill was when [she and her husband] separated in 2004.\u201d  Tr. at 15.  Applicant also testified that she \u201cnever\ngot a chance to properly learn how to pay bills,\u201d that she did not keep good financial records, and that she had not\ncontacted her creditors as of the close of the record.  Tr. at 17, 31, and 59. \n     \n\u201cQ: . . . And did you go through any sort of budgeting classes with [the credit counselor]?  A: They do\n6\nbudgeting and learning how to not impulse shop.  She went over my budget with a fine tooth comb.  Q: Is impulse\nshopping something that you have been trying to get under control?  A: Yes.  I don\u2019t spend a whole lot of money, I really\nspend very little.  But I do impulse shop.  If I see something, like a pair of shoes, I have to buy them.\u201d  Tr. at 55. \n \n5\nFurthermore, the record does not demonstrate that Applicant has established the second\nclause of this mitigating condition, that her debts cast no doubt on her judgment, etc.  In addition to\nevidence that her debts began prior to the traumatic events of 2004 and 2005, we note the Judge\u2019s\nown finding that Applicant simply did not know how to maintain a budget.   We also note\n5\nApplicant\u2019s own testimony that she engages in \u201cimpulse shopping,\u201d which she has only begun to\naddress since her meeting with the credit counselor just prior to the hearing.   \n6\nFor similar reasons, we conclude that Applicant has not met her burden of persuasion\nregarding FCMC 20(b).  The record does not support a conclusion that, viewed as a whole,\nApplicant\u2019s debts originated from causes outside her control.  To the contrary, as stated above, the\nrecord demonstrates that Applicant\u2019s debts began in approximately 2000, and that they were affected\nnot only by her emotional dislocation but by other things, such as her lack of knowledge regarding\nbudgeting and her impulse shopping.  Furthermore, the Judge\u2019s own analysis undermines a\nconclusion that Applicant has behaved responsibly in regard to her debts.  See, e.g., his comments\ndescribed above, to the effect that Applicant has not addressed her debts as of the close of the record.\nAfter examining the record as a whole, we conclude that the evidence does not support the\nJudge\u2019s favorable decision, either as regards the mitigating conditions or the whole-person analysis.\nLeaving aside questions as to whether Applicant\u2019s debts originated on the whole from causes outside\nher control, there is no record evidence of responsible behavior in regard to those debts, within the\nmeaning of the Directive. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 08-06567 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 29, 2009)\n(Applicant must develop a reasonable plan for repayment of debt, accompanied by \u201cconcomitant\nconduct,\u201d i.e., actions which evidence a serious intent to effectuate the plan.)  The record does not\nsupport a conclusion that Applicant has met her burden of persuasion under the Egan standard.\n\u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified information will be\nresolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E2.2(b).   \n\n6\nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s favorable security clearance decision is REVERSED.  \nSigned: Michael Y Ra\u2019anan           \nMichael Y.

On July 1, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) enumerating security concerns arising\nunder Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The action was taken under Executive\nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960),\nas amended, Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and\nthe revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December\n29, 2005, which are effective for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nIn a package of materials dated July 21, 2009, Applicant admitted 25 of the 33\nallegations set forth in the SOR and requested a hearing.  DOHA assigned the case to\n1\nme on September 9, 2009. The parties agreed to a hearing date of October 22, 2009. A\nnotice of hearing was issued to that effect on October 7, 2009. The hearing was\nDecember 7, 2009\n\n For the past three years, she has \u201cditched [her] business clothes, put on [her] jeans\u201d and cleaned office\n      2\nbuildings at night.

The record was closed on\nNovember 2, 2009. Applicant was given until November 5, 2009, to submit materials\nshe wished to be considered as part of the record. On November 18, 2009, one\ndocument was received. It was accepted into the record without objection as exhibit\n(Ex.) A. Based on a review of the testimony, submissions, and exhibits, and in light of\nthe unique facts in this case, I find Applicant met her burden regarding the financial\nconsiderations security concerns raised. Security clearance is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 49-year-old administrative assistant working for a defense\ncontractor. She has worked for the same employer for over a year and a half. For\nadditional income, she has cleaned office buildings after work for the past three years.2\nApplicant earned a high school diploma. She is a widow with one surviving child, an\nadult who lives on her own. Applicant admits that she is \u201cbad with the dates,\u201d so the\ntime frame depicted follows the testimony and her SF-86 as close as possible.3\nAt the age of 19, Applicant married her late husband. In the early 2000s, her\nhusband injured his back on the job. The injury limited his ability to generate a full\nincome. In 2002 or 2003, the apartment in which Applicant lived was destroyed by\nflooding, ruining her possessions.  Then, in early 2004, after nearly 24 years of\n4\nmarriage, she and her husband attempted a separation. Applicant moved out of the\nfamily home and rented an apartment. It was the first time she had lived on her own\nand the first time she had to take responsibility for bills, a job previously handled by her\nhusband. Applicant realized she would need a decent income to survive independently,\nso she worked by day and enrolled in school at night. At one point while she was\nattending school, she maintained two jobs.5\nApplicant was in school for about eight months when, on June 18, 2004, her 22-\nyear-old son was repeatedly shot and brutally murdered in their otherwise quiet city.6\nAfter his body was discovered, a manhunt ensued as the culprit eluded police and\ncrossed state lines. The murder made America\u2019s Most Wanted and the Federal Bureau\nof Investigation became involved.  Applicant quit school during this period. She\n7\n\n Tr. 16.\n      8\n Tr. 37. \n      9\n Tr. 34.\n      10\n Tr. 17.\n      11\n Tr. 17.\n      12\n Id.\n      13\n Tr. 79.\n      14\n Id.\n      15\n3\nremained in a \u201cstate of complete shock\u201d as her only son\u2019s murderer was extradited,\nreturned to stand trial, and received his sentence: \u201cI was a wreck. I mean, I couldn\u2019t eat,\nI couldn\u2019t sleep, couldn\u2019t function.\u201d  She tried to provide solace to her daughter, who\n8\nwas a young mother of 24, living with Applicant\u2019s husband, and devastated by the\nmurder of her only sibling. Meanwhile, Applicant suffered from panic attacks and started\nto develop some issues related to her grief.  As a result, she was unsuccessful in\n9\nmaintaining continued employment for a while.\nAround July or early August 2005, Applicant\u2019s husband moved out of the family\nhome, a rental property.  At the time, Applicant was unemployed. She lived in a shelter\n10\nfor nearly a month, then found an apartment she could not really afford. On August 21,\n2005, Applicant received a telephone call informing her that her husband had been in a\ncar accident. When she arrived at the hospital, she was informed that he was not\nexpected to live. Applicant visited her comatose husband in the hospital everyday,\nsitting with him as long as she could \u201cpretty much knowing that he was going to die, but\nnot believing it.\u201d . Around the time of the accident, Applicant breached her own rental\n11\nlease and moved back into the home her husband had previously rented. In assuming\nher husband\u2019s lease, she tried to help her unemployed daughter and grandchildren\nduring this time of crisis. Although Applicant\u2019s husband emerged from his coma, he was\nin a vegetative state and transferred to an appropriate medical facility. He ultimately\ndied on December 19, 2005, shortly before the winter holidays. \nExactly two weeks after her husband\u2019s death, shortly before New Year\u2019s Day of\n2006, Applicant returned to her job, a move she now recognizes as having been\npsychologically premature, but she needed to generate an income.  She stated: \u201cI was\n12\na mess, and I started having panic attacks, I\u2019d go to work, I would have to leave, I\ncouldn\u2019t function. Mentally, I was a mess.\u201d  In 2006, while suffering from depression,\n13\nshe forgot  to file her state taxes.  Her bills had piled up and were neglected: \u201cI never\n14\ngot a chance to properly learn how to pay bills, and stuff, because I was in too big of a\nmess to pay them.\u201d  About a month after her husband died, she went to a therapist for\n15\n\n Applicant would ultimately return for short bouts of therapy, pasting about six weeks each, as needed.\n      16\nHer need is generally triggered by certain \u201canniversary dates,\u201d such as the time of her son\u2019s birthday or the\nholidays.

She was prescribed medication and advised to take\n17\n\u201ca low-key job, since that [was] all [she] could possibly handle for a while.\u201d  She\n18\nfollowed-up this treatment at an outpatient psychiatric facility from April 2006 through\nNovember 2006, where she was diagnosed as suffering from \u201cMajor Depressive\nDisorder and Panic Disorder.\u201d  Ultimately, she accepted her current position, which has\n19\nhelped her function better.  Today, she is still \u201cdealing with the grief\u201d of losing both her\n20\nson and her husband within a short period of time, but she now is \u201cable to deal with it. .\n. . to go to work with no panic attacks,\u201d despite the fact she recognizes her finances are\n\u201ca mess.\u201d21\nBy 2006, Applicant could no longer afford to rent the family home. She moved\ninto an apartment and her daughter found another place to live. Applicant gave her\ndaughter a cell phone that Applicant had taken in her own name, but the daughter failed\nto make payments on the account before it became delinquent.  Applicant immediately\n22\nvacated her first apartment and broke her lease due to an infestation of mice followed\nby a broken sewer system.  Rather than face these problems, she sought refuge in a\n23\nshelter. In 2006 or 2007, Applicant rented a cottage in which she assumed a land line\nwhich was already installed. To her eventual surprise, she was later charged for what\nappears to be a pre-existing balance.  Her next apartment was flooded. All of her\n24\nclothing, furniture, and all her other possessions were ruined or destroyed. . In 2007,\n25\nher automobile caught fire as it sat in a parking lot. It, too, was destroyed.  Another\n26\nvehicle was returned as a voluntary repossession.\nApplicant received the SOR in August 2009. Department Counsel sent her a\ncopy of her October 18, 2008, credit report in August 2009. In early October 2009,\nApplicant sought financial counseling to \u201cfind out how to [contact her creditors]. [She did\n\n Tr. 54.\n      27\n See, e.g., Tr. 99100.

Tr. 100-101.\n Id.\n      29\n Tr. 41, 58. Applicant does not recognize some of the accounts at issue, for example, the accounts noted\n      30\nat SOR allegations \u00b61.m and 1.dd. Tr. 58, 72. She admitted, however, to other entries she concedes she does\nnot recognize, such as those found at SOR allegation\u00b6 1.q.\n Applicant noted that she is not one to spend money frivolously, although she concedes she can be an\n      31\nimpulse shopper with regards to shoes. She has since controlled this impulse.

In noting she had felt overwhelmed, Applicant stated feeling overwhelmed \u201cis what drove me to\n      35\nthis counselor, to try to get this straight. I just felt like I was under a mountain of debt, I just felt like I couldn\u2019t\ndo anything about it, for the longest time.\u201d Tr. 46. She further noted that she has only started to feel stronger\nsince taking her current position, now wishing to \u201cmake a dent\u201d in her debts. Id.\n5\nnot] know how to do it.\u201d  Before counseling, she found it exceptionally difficult to\n27\nmanage and document even the basics regarding her finances.  Applicant was\n28\ninstructed as to how to contact her creditors.  She was advised to meet with a\n29\nbankruptcy attorney, which she did. He instructed her as to the proper manner of\ndisputing an account through the credit reporting bureaus in order to obtain current\nbalances and to discern whether an account entry is genuinely hers.  He also showed\n30\nApplicant how to develop and follow a budget.  Applicant also discovered that due to\n31\nher inexperience and a lack of guidance from her office\u2019s payroll office, her total taxes\nwere being under-withheld. This is because she has two jobs.  She has since\n32\naddressed her tax issues through payroll allotments.  She is now going through her\n33\ndebts to formally dispute several of her accounts. She feels she is now strong enough\nto face her financial dilemma and proceed with seeking Chapter 7 bankruptcy\nprotection regarding the approximately $28,000 at issue.  This amount may be less,\n34\nbased on Applicant\u2019s success in disputing several of the accounts at issue.\nRegarding the debts at issue, some of the allegations concern judgments against\nApplicant. She never went to court regarding any of these debts because, at the time\nand given the circumstances, she felt \u201coverwhelmed.\u201d  Progress has only been made\n35\ntoward the student loans incurred for the semester during which she dropped out of\nschool owing to her son\u2019s murder, although no evidence of such payment was\n\n Tr. 31. Regarding payments toward SOR allegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.bb and 1.cc, Applicant was asked whether she\n      36\nkept \u201cany receipts , or statements\u201d showing that the nominal payments she alleged were made. She\nanswered: \u201cI wasn\u2019t exactly keeping good records. . . . I can\u2019t remember if it was paid by check or money\norder.\u201d Tr. 31. \n Tr. 44.\n      37\n Tr. 101.\n      38\n Tr. 90.\n      39\n Tr. 91.\n      40\n Id.\n      41\n Tr. 77.\n      42\n Tr. 81-82.\n      43\n Tr. 82. Applicant does not earn an hourly wage from her cleaning job. The work pays a flat rate of $157\n      44\nevery two weeks regardless of the number of hours it entails. Tr. 93. It usually takes 2-3 hours per night, five\nwork nights a week plus weekends. Tr. 94. Consequently, she works 14-21 hours a week for about $78 a\nweek.\n Tr. 88.\n      45\n Tr. 88-89, 92. Applicant\u2019s financial counseling is free, so she intends to continue with it. Tr. 89.\n      46\n6\nintroduced.  Many of the medical debts noted are related to the fact Applicant is a\n36\nsevere asthmatic and had a protracted stay in the hospital for pneumonia.37\nApplicant is \u201ca very likeable woman. . . . [who] is someone who has definitely\nseen her share of troubles in her life.\u201d  She lives alone and has no immediate family in\n38\nher vicinity. She currently lives a simple life with no genuine frills or unusual expenses.39\nShe is current on her car payments and looking for less expensive car insurance.40\nApplicant follows her budget closely and monitors her expenditures.  She earns a\n41\ngross salary of approximately $2,840 a month with deductions amounting to about\n$1,240.  With past tax issues addressed, those deductions may now be reduced.  Her\n42\n43\ncurrent take home salary is about $2,100 a month, plus about $300-400 a month from\nher cleaning job.  .Her monthly expenses run to just under $2,500. Applicant concedes\n44\nshe is living \u201cpaycheck to paycheck\u201d and explained that is why she has been \u201cafraid to\ntackle this mountain of debt.\u201d  While concerned she does not currently have the $1,300\n45\nneeded to pay for a bankruptcy petition, she has close to $2,000 available in her 401(k)\naccount, she has been advised that she can pay for her bankruptcy filing in\ninstallments, and she is checking to see if her attorney\u2019s costs are reasonable.46\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\n\n See also ISCR Case No. 94-1075 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, 1995).\n      47\n Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\n      48\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 at 7-8 (App. Bd. Jan. 27, 1995).\n      49\n Id.\n      50\n7\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions. These guidelines are not\ninflexible rules of law. Recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these\nguidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process.\nThe administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and\ncommonsense decision. Under AG \u00b6 2(c), this process is a conscientious scrutiny of a\nnumber of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge\nmust consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present,\nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nThe government must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in\nthe SOR. An applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to\nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by\nDepartment Counsel. . . .\u201d  The burden of proof is something less than a\n47\npreponderance of evidence.  The ultimate burden of persuasion is on the applicant.  \n48\n49\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\ngovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration\nof the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \u201cThe clearly consistent standard\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access\n50\n\n Id.\n      51\n AG \u00b6 18.\n      52\n8\nto sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such sensitive\ninformation.51\nBased \nupon \nconsideration \nof \nthe \nevidence, \nGuideline \nF \n(Financial\nConsiderations) is the most pertinent to this case. Conditions pertaining to this\nadjudicative guideline that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as\nwell as those which would mitigate such concerns, are set forth and discussed below.\nAnalysis\nGuideline F \u2013 Financial Considerations\nUnder Guideline F, \u201cfailure or an inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy\ndebts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nan unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation.\u201d  The Directive sets out several potentially disqualifying conditions under\n52\nthis guideline. \nBetween about 2003 and 2008, Applicant and her late husband, or Applicant on\nher own, acquired debt. Applicant\u2019s financial condition worsened and her debts became\ndelinquent as she dealt with the murder of her only son, the untimely death of her\nestranged husband, and her attempt to become self-sufficient in the workplace.\nTherefore, Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) AG \u00b6 19(a)\n(\u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d) and FC DC AG \u00b6 9(c) (\u201ca history of not\nmeeting financial obligations\u201d) apply. With such conditions raised, the burden shifts to\nApplicant to overcome the case against her and mitigate security concerns. \nAlthough Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts remain virtually unaddressed today, they\nwere mostly created and became delinquent during an extraordinarily tragic and\nunfortunate string of events. Her son was murdered. Her husband died from injuries\nsuffered in a car accident, her home and an apartment were flooded, and a car was\ndestroyed in a fire. She had difficulty maintaining stable employment between these\nevents due to her fragile mental state and psychological recovery. Despite her difficulty\nin functioning day to day, she pursued appropriate psychological counseling and\nfollowed her doctor\u2019s advice regarding her well-being and types of appropriate\nemployment. She also maintained two jobs in an attempt to stay current on her daily\nneeds. While she essentially has recovered from her earlier psychological problems\nand is now capable of both steady employment and daily budgeting, the amount of\ndelinquent debt that accumulated during her state of depression has been\noverwhelming. Although the majority of her debts remain unresolved, FC MC AG \u00b620(a)\n(\u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\u201d) applies to some degree.\n\n9\nMoreover, in light of this string of misfortune,  FC MC AG \u00b6 20(b) (\u201cthe conditions that\nresulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce\nor separation) and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances\u201d) also\napplies. \nApplicant received financial counseling and has consulted a bankruptcy attorney.\nTo date, however, no tangible efforts have been demonstrated or documented\nregarding the past due accounts at issue. Consequently, neither FC MC \u00b6 20(c) (\u201cthe\nperson has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear\nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control\u201d) nor FC MC \u00b6 20(d)\n(\u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise\nresolve debts\u201d) applies. No other mitigating conditions apply.\nCurrently living paycheck to paycheck, Applicant is presently capable of living\nwithin her means but for her delinquent debt. That debt makes her current financial\nsituation relatively dire. Her contemplated bankruptcy seems to be her only option for\nstarting anew. Given the facts, the creation of her delinquent debt is understandable.\nGiven those same facts, their neglect is also within the realm of understanding by any\nbut the least empathetic. While security concerns regarding the creation and neglect of\nthese delinquent debts may be mitigated, Applicant has failed to demonstrate any\nsuccessful attempts to address those debts. Therefore, financial considerations security\nconcerns remain. \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security clearance\nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the\nguidelines and the whole person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, as well as the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nfactors. Applicant is an intelligent and accommodating individual. As noted by\n\n10\nDepartment Counsel, she is a \u201clikeable woman who has certainly seen more than her\nshare of troubles in life.\u201d \nWith regard to the \u201cwhole person,\u201d many factors speak in Applicant\u2019s favor. The\ncumulative effect of Applicant\u2019s troubles on her finances was plainly overwhelming. This\nis particularly true for a teenage bride, newly separated after nearly 25 years of\nmarriage, who had no personal finance experience and whose husband had solely\nmanaged their family accounts. Just as she had no control over the events that\nimpacted her ability to focus on work or her mounting bills, she had no knowledge as to\nhow she could address them once she was able to do so. Additionally, in reaction to\nthese events, Applicant demonstrated initiative and sound judgment. She sought\npsychological counseling on her own volition. She pursued post-secondary education in\nthe hopes of finding a better paying job. She willingly discarded any sense of vanity by\nliving in a shelter to save money and by undertaking the menial work of a night\ncustodian for the sole purpose of earning additional income. Now psychologically fit and\ncapable of addressing her accumulated debt, she has received financial counseling,\nadopted a workable budget, and consulted with a bankruptcy attorney about seeking\nbankruptcy protection. Finally, her highly credible and forthright testimony was generally\nconsistent with the facts of record. There is no indication she could be exploited over\nher past misfortune, nor are these distinct facts likely to recur.\nSpeaking against Applicant is the fact no tangible efforts have been made to\naddress her debts. Although her debts became delinquent not through simple neglect,\nbut through the distraction caused by profound depression and anxiety, they are now\ntoo unwieldy for her to address alone. Having recovered from her past inability to focus\nand now able to live within her means with regard to her current and future expenses,\nshe recognizes that bankruptcy is not only an available option for addressing her\ndelinquent debt, but her most likely route toward financial recovery. With regard to such\na filing, she has about $2,000 in her 401(k) and an attorney who is willing to take\npayment in installments. \nIn summarizing Applicant\u2019s situation, it must be noted that Applicant did not\nsimply lose her child and husband. In 2006, her teenage son\u2019s brutal murder was\nfollowed by a protracted manhunt, sensational trial, and sentencing. Despite daily\nreminders of her loss, she persevered as she and her husband tried to provide solace\nto each other and to their remaining child. The following year, in 2007, her estranged\nhusband was in a car accident. She vigilantly stayed by his side until he died during the\n2007 winter holiday season. Left alone in her grief, she was the only familial support for\nher daughter and grandchildren. With no support system of her own, she sought the\nhelp of a psychiatrist on a limited basis as she fought to refocus on a daily life. Despite\nthis struggle, it was an effort to simply wake, go to work, and go home. Bills went\nunpaid and obligations went unmet. In 2008, she accepted her current position as an\nadministrative assistant, a job in which accomplishments are measured not in\nindependent initiative but in timely reactive productivity. In that capacity, she has\nlearned to once again be productive and she has proved her professional mettle.\nApplicant\u2019s delinquent obligations were not created through frivolity or\ncapriciousness, nor were they left unaddressed until recently because of poor self-\n\n11\ncontrol, lack of judgment, or an unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations The\nfacts here are extraordinary and distinct. One need not be overly empathetic to\nappreciate the depth of despair Applicant has endured or its impact on her mental,\nphysical, and financial health. The circumstances surrounding the loss of her son are\nhorrific; those related to the loss of her husband are truly tragic. While she still has\ndifficult days, which is understandable, she has recently recovered. Having no adult\npeers to rely upon for support, her recovery was achieved with little help. In light of\nthese facts, it is not surprising that her older debts, already delinquent, took a\nnecessary backseat to her emotional healing. \nToday, Applicant is pursuing bankruptcy, a legitimate route for addressing her\npast due accounts. Although it is a general tenet in these proceedings that promises to\nsatisfy one\u2019s debt in the future are insufficient to mitigate financial considerations\nsecurity concerns, these particular facts raise the same conditions enumerated in FC\nMC AG \u00b6 20(b) to a higher and more pervasive level. Applicant has not demonstrated\npoor self-control, lack of judgment, or an unwillingness to abide by rules and\nregulations, but rather the basic human frailty one endures in the wake of horrendous\nfamily tragedy. \nAs noted above, any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be\nallowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such\nsensitive information. Applicant accumulated debt during a period of constructive\npsychological incapacity after two horrific losses. The duration of her incapacity could\nnot be predicted or expedited, especially since it was protracted by continuing personal\nmisfortunes. Her recovery was highly individualized, personal, and protracted. She has\nnow returned to the stability and reliability she once enjoyed. As well, she is now\nsufficiently healthy to address her debts and has both the willingness and the ability to\ndo so. Her facts and circumstances are both exceptional and highly unique. There is no\nindication that Applicant poses a possible risk of deliberately or inadvertently failing to\nprotect or safeguard classified information. With security concerns regarding her\nfinances mitigated through the extraordinary facts presented, I conclude it is clearly\nconsistent with national security to grant Applicant a security clearance. Clearance is\ngranted. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a \u2013 1.pp\nFor Applicant\n\n12\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant a security clearance.\nClearance is granted.\nARTHUR E.

Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On November 23, 2009, after the hearing, Administrative Judge David M.\nWhite denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive\n\u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\n\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether certain of the Judge\u2019s factual\nfindings were supported by substantial record evidence; and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse security\nclearance decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Finding no error, we affirm.\nThe Judge found the following:  Applicant has numerous delinquent debts, totaling $79,513.\nAfter receiving interrogatories from DOHA, Applicant entered into a agreement with a credit\ncounseling service, whereby Applicant would pay to the service $2,569 a month.  After 49 months\nhis debts were to be paid off.  He has not made payments, however, due in part to a recent tax\nassessment from the IRS and in part to his having to make child support payments.  Applicant\nattributes his financial problems to a job loss in 2002, in which he was \u201cforced to quit\u201d a position\ndue to a conflict of interest with another company for which he was also doing work.  Additionally,\nit was hard for him to find work after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.  Applicant enjoys\nan excellent reputation for his good character.\nIn resolving the case adversely to Applicant, the Judge stated that Applicant had failed to\ndemonstrate a track record of responsible actions in regard to his debts.  \u201cThe record demonstrates\nhis ongoing inability to address his delinquent debts.  Applicant\u2019s ongoing insolvency generates\ncontinuing potential for pressure, coercion, or duress.\u201d  Decision at 7.  \nApplicant challenges the Judge\u2019s statement that Applicant\u2019s having been forced to quit a job\nin 2002 caused his financial problems.  However, the Judge\u2019s findings about the circumstances of\nApplicant\u2019s leaving his employment are based upon substantial record evidence.  Furthermore, there\nis no basis to conclude that the Judge mis-weighed this evidence or otherwise attributed to it\nunwarranted significance.  \nApplicant requests oral argument before the Board.  The Board\u2019s authority is derived from\nthe Directive.  The Directive does not authorize the Board to hold oral arguments.   \nAfter reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant data\nand articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

Howry, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nWHITE, David M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant owes more than $79,000 for 26 delinquent debts that accrued over the\npast seven years. He partially resolved two other delinquencies, but has not established\na track record of financial responsibility or solvency. Based upon a thorough review of\nthe case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is denied. \nApplicant submitted his security clearance application on October 9, 2008. On\nJune 15, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline F\n(Financial Considerations). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense (DoD) for SORs issued after September 1,\n2006. Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on July 9, 2009. He answered (AR)\nNovember 23, 2009\n\n2\nthe SOR in writing on July 13, 2009, and requested a hearing before an administrative\njudge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on July 27, 2009, and DOHA\nassigned the case to me on July 29, 2009.\nDOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on August 4, 2009, and I convened the hearing\nas scheduled on August 24, 2009. Department Counsel offered Government Exhibits\n(GE) 1 through 7, which were admitted over Applicant\u2019s partial objection to the present\naccuracy of some information. Applicant\u2019s objection to page 2 of GE 5 was granted and\nthat page was not admitted into evidence. Applicant testified on his own behalf, and\noffered Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through D, which were also admitted. Applicant\ndeclined my offer to leave the record open after the hearing for submission of additional\nevidence. However, on August 26, 2009, he submitted additional evidence via\nDepartment Counsel and requested that it be considered. On that date, Department\nCounsel forwarded these additional documents with no objection to their admissibility.\nThis evidence was marked AE E and admitted. DOHA received the transcript of the\nhearing (Tr.) on September 1, 2009.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 51-year-old engineer who has worked for several federal\ncontractors over the last 20 years. In his answer to the SOR, he denied the allegations\nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.j, 1.m through 1.u, and 1.x through 1.z. He admitted the\nallegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k, 1.l, 1.v, and 1.w. Applicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated into\nthe following findings of fact.\nApplicant is separated pending divorce. He has two adult children, a 14-year-old\nchild for whom he is required to provide child support, and two younger children who\nlive with his estranged wife. He has no military service, but held security clearances in\nconnection with several former jobs. He is presently unemployed, pending resolution of\nhis security clearance application. (GE 1 at 6, 12-24, 27, 31-32; AR at 6; AE J; Tr. at  7-\n8, 74-75, 89.)\nDue to an apparent typographical error, the amount of the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6\n1.n is identical to that alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.o. All record evidence indicates that the\namount owed on the SOR \u00b6 1.n debt is $679. This is significantly less than the alleged\namount, and I corrected the SOR to conform to the evidence. Applicant also indicated\nhis belief that the alleged amount was erroneous. (GE 2 at 74; GE 6 at 3; Tr. at 107.) \nWith the foregoing exception, all of the SOR-alleged delinquent debts accurately\nreflect the contents of Applicant\u2019s various credit bureau reports (CBRs) in the record. He\nclaims not to recognize some of them, but he has neither investigated nor disputed\nthose debts despite being on notice of potential security implications for the past eight\nmonths. The weight of the evidence clearly establishes that Applicant owes the 26\nSOR-listed delinquent debts. The majority of these debts became delinquent between\n2002 and 2004, but several became delinquent as recently as 2007 and 2008. These 26\n\n3\ndebts, including two that were reduced to judgments, total $79,513. (GE 2 through 6; Tr.\nat 84-114.)\nOn March 17, 2009, after receiving financial interrogatories from DOHA\nconcerning his delinquent debts, Applicant entered a credit counseling and debt\nmanagement agreement with a credit counseling service. The agreement included\nevery SOR-listed debt, except the $48 collection account alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.q, and also\nlisted several other debts for a total of $87,414. The agreement called for Applicant to\nmake monthly payments of $2,569 to the service, and contemplated resolution of all the\nlisted debts in 49 months (April 2013). (GE 4 at 107-114.) \nApplicant provided no evidence that he made any payments under this plan. To\nthe contrary, he testified:\nI haven\u2019t taken the responsibility to look into them, because I hired a credit\ncounselor and all those debts you just mentioned are listed on that form.\nCurrently, I just don\u2019t have the resources to pay the credit counseling to\naddress them, but she\u2019s all ready to go, and I will address those debts. . . .\nWell, currently they\u2019re waiting for payment. . . . And the reason why\npayment had not been received is because I ran into a new IRS debt and\nI\u2019ve been paying support, and then I found out my job was going to end.\n(Tr. at 115-116.) The IRS debt to which Applicant referred was a recent assessment of\nan undetermined amount in connection with his taking out an emergency loan from his\n401(k) plan. The support payments were for current and delinquent child support that\nwas not alleged in the SOR, for which his wages were being garnished. As of August\n2009, he had paid the arrearage down to $11,196. In January 2007, this arrearage was\n$38,140. He is now drawing $600 per week in unemployment compensation, of which\n$150 is garnished for child support. (AE C; AE at 5; Tr. at 68, 72-75, 87, 101-102, 116,\n119.)\nApplicant traces his financial problems back to the early 1990s. He had a good-\npaying job as a software engineer for a major aerospace company from September\n1996 to January 2002. He was \u201cforced to quit\u201d that job after his manager found out that\nhe was also doing contract work for a competitor company, creating a conflict of\ninterest. He then worked several jobs under various contractual arrangements. He\ntestified and submitted several internet articles about outsourcing and layoffs in the\naerospace industry after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks that made it hard for\nhim to find work. He also submitted income tax documents showing his adjusted gross\nincome in 2002 was $9,641, and 2003 was $16,767. In March 2004, he was hired by\nanother defense contractor and his income rose to $54,700 that year. From 2005\nthrough 2007, he made over $93,000 per year at that job, which he left in 2008. He did\nnot provide any information concerning his 2008 income. (AR at 2-3; AE A; Tr. at 34-36,\n65-68, 75-76; 79-82, 122-127.) \n\n4\nApplicant submitted \u201cAffidavits of Character\u201d that were filed on his behalf by his\neldest sister, eldest brother, and two adult daughters in connection with his pending\ndivorce action. They describe him as a good family man who is responsible and of good\ncharacter. He also submitted three letters from day care, school, and Sunday school\nteachers describing his active participation in caring for his two youngest children. (AE\nE.)\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider and apply the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG).\nIn addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative\nguidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to\nbe used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2, describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s\noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According\nto AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and (c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable\nguidelines in the context of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept.\nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded in mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201c[t]he applicant is\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the\nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Section 7\nof Executive Order 10865 provides, \u201c[a]ny determination under this order adverse to an\napplicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense\nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nA person applying for access to classified information seeks to enter into a\nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\n\n5\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern pertaining to financial considerations:\nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially over-\nextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nCompulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes\nincluding espionage. Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources\nof income is also a security concern. It may indicate proceeds from\nfinancially profitable criminal acts.\nAG \u00b6 19 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying. Department Counsel asserted the applicability of two of these potentially\ndisqualifying conditions: \u201c(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;\u201d and \u201c(c) a history\nof not meeting financial obligations.\u201d (Tr. at 20-21.) From 2002 to present, Applicant\naccumulated the 26 SOR-listed delinquent debts that total more than $79,500. He has\ndone nothing to effectively address or resolve any of those debts. He entered into an\nagreement with a credit counseling service to attempt resolution of these debts over the\nnext four years, but did not and cannot afford to make any payments as required under\nthe plan. Applicant\u2019s present financial inability to pay these substantial remaining\ndelinquencies supports ongoing security concerns under AG \u00b6 19(a). He is under\ncontinuing financial duress, so he remains at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to\ngenerate funds. The evidence further established a lengthy history of not meeting many\nsignificant financial obligations, raising security concerns under AG \u00b6 19(c). This history\nindicates poor self-control, lack of judgment, and unwillingness to abide by rules and\nregulations, thereby raising questions about his reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information.\nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising from\nthe foregoing financial considerations. The potentially applicable mitigating conditions\nare:\n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment;\n\n6\n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control;\n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts; and\n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the\npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides\ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.\nAG \u00b6 20(a) was not established because Applicant\u2019s many delinquencies arose\nover the last seven years and continue at present. Many resulted from his failure to\nreduce expenditures during a two-year period of under-employment after he was forced\nto quit a job for having engaged in outside work that created a conflict of interest. While\nloss of employment is potentially mitigating under AG \u00b6 20(b), his job loss was the direct\nresult of his irresponsible conduct, and failing to regain meaningful employment while\nspending on credit did not constitute responsible action thereafter. Applicant identified\nhis pending divorce as another source of financial problems, but the vast majority of his\ndelinquent debt preceded his recent marital troubles, which also remain unresolved. His\nonly demonstrated attempt to resolve these debts was a four-year debt management\nplan toward which he made no payments. This program involved minimal financial and\nlegal counseling, but it has yielded no results to date and there is no substantial basis to\nconclude it will succeed going forward. None of the debts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through\n1.z have been resolved, and more than $79,500 in delinquent debts remain outstanding.\nWhile these are small steps in the right direction, meaningful mitigation is not yet\nestablished under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) or (d). Applicant provided no documented proof to\nsubstantiate the basis for disputing any of his delinquencies under AG \u00b6 20(e). \nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\n\n7\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe pertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s conduct of\nsecurity concern was incurring 26 delinquent debts, which total more than $79,500. He\ndemonstrated no effective progress toward resolving any of them, and remains\nfinancially overextended. Although his two-year period of under-employment ended in\nearly 2004, he did nothing to address or resolve any of these debts, in part due to\nsubstantial delinquent child support obligations and IRS debt that was not listed on the\nSOR. His actions have done little to address the resulting security concerns, and he has\nnot yet established a good-faith track record of financial responsibility or permanent\nbehavioral changes. The record demonstrates his ongoing inability to address his\ndelinquent debt. Applicant\u2019s ongoing insolvency generates continuing potential for\npressure, coercion, or duress. He exhibited an incomplete understanding of his financial\nsituation and failed to demonstrate that his financial problems are unlikely to continue or\nworsen, at least for the next several years. Applicant presented insufficient evidence to\nmitigate security concerns arising from his history of failing to meet financial obligations,\nand his inability to pay his substantial delinquent debts. The record generates significant\ndoubt as to his present eligibility and suitability for a security clearance.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.z:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                  \nDAVID M. WHITE\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On \nAugust 27, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline B, Foreign \nInfluence, for Applicant.

Department counsel was prepared to proceed on \nOctober 16, 2009. The case was assigned to me on October 22, 2009. On November 5, \n2009, a Notice of Hearing was issued scheduling the hearing for November 18, 2009. \nThe hearing was held as scheduled. The government offered Government Exhibits \n(Gov) 1 - 3 which were admitted without objection. The government requested that \nadministrative notice be taken of three sets of documents. The documents were marked \nas Administrative Notice Documents (Admin Not) I - III without objection. Applicant \nJanuary 28, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n \ntestified, called two witnesses and submitted two exhibits which were admitted as \nApplicant Exhibits (AE) A - B without objection.  DOHA received the transcript of hearing \non November 30, 2009.

Following the swift invasion and successful removal from power, the United \nStates endeavored to set a solid foundation of democratic institutions in Iraq. The \nConstitution in Iraq was ratified on October 15, 2005. After free elections in 2005, Iraq\u2019s \nnew government, a parliamentary democracy, took office in March 2006. (Admin Not I) \n \n \nIn 2007, 92% of Iraq\u2019s exports were crude oil and crude oil materials. Almost half \nof Iraq\u2019s exports went to the United States.  The United States\u2019 ultimate goal in Iraq is to \nestablish a peaceful, united, stable, democratic, and secure nation that will be an ally of \nthe United States in the war against terrorism. The United States has invested \nthousands of lives and billions of dollars to assist in the reconstruction of Iraq. Success \nin Iraq is a high national priority of the United States. (Admin Not I) \n \n \nDespite the elections and new government, Baghdad, Mosul, and several other \nareas have especially serious problems with violent terrorists and insurgents. Although \nthere have been recent improvements in the security environment, Iraq remains \ndangerous, volatile, and unpredictable.  Some areas of Iraq are more peaceful and less \nsusceptible to terrorist attacks than others; however, all areas of the country are still \nvery dangerous. Terrorists have the ability to strike most areas of the country with \nexplosive devices and mines. Numerous attacks and kidnappings have targeted the \nU.S. Armed Forces, contractors, and other civilians, as well as Iraqis. Even with U.S. \nand Iraqi aggressive governmental action against terrorists, the threat of terrorism in \nIraq remains very high. Terrorist groups can conduct intelligence activities as effectively \nas state intelligence services. (Admin Not I) \n \nJordan \n \n \nJordan is a constitutional monarchy with a developing economy and a modern \ninfrastructure. Jordan has followed a pro-western foreign policy and has had close \nrelations with the United States for more than four decades. (Admin Not II) \n \nThe Jordanian government respects human rights in some areas, but its overall \nrecord continues to reflect some problems. Problems include: torture, arbitrary arrest, \nprolonged detention, denial of due process, infringement on citizen\u2019s privacy rights, \n\n \n3 \n \n \npolitical detainees, and restrictions on freedom of speech, press, assembly, association, \nand movement. (Admin Not II) \n \nUnder Jordanian law any male relative may prevent a woman or child from \nleaving Jordan by placing a hold on their travel with the Jordanian authorities, even if \nthey are U.S. citizens. Jordanian law applies to dual U.S.-Jordanian citizens. (Admin \nNot II) \n \nThe Jordanian government publicly condemned terrorist acts throughout the \nworld, practiced strict security measures, passed new anti-terror legislation, and \ndisrupted several terrorist plots. Despite Jordan\u2019s aggressive pursuit of terrorists, the \nthreat of terrorism remains high in Jordan. Al-Qaida has focused terrorist activities \nagainst Jordan and U.S. interests in Jordan. Terrorist organizations have targeted the \nUnited States for intelligence through human espionage and by other means. \nInternational terrorist groups have conducted intelligence operations as effectively as \nstate intelligence services. (Admin Not II) \n \nSyria \n \n \nSince March 1963, the Syrian Arab Republic has been ruled by an authoritarian \nregime. Syria is currently included on the Department of State's List of State Sponsors \nof Terrorism due to the presence of several terrorist groups in Syria. According to the \nDepartment of State, the Syrian government continues to provide political and material \nsupport to Hizballah and Palestinian terrorist groups. Several terrorist groups base their \nexternal leadership within Syria's borders, and maintain offices in Syria. Syria is \u201cone of \nthe primary transit points for foreign fighters entering Iraq.\u201d (Admin Not III) \n \n \nThe Syrian government\u2019s human rights record is not good. The United States \nState Department notes the following human rights abuses occurring in Syria: systemic \nrepression of citizens\u2019 abilities to change government; arbitrary or unlawful deprivation \nof life; torture and physical abuse of prisoners and detainees; arbitrary arrests and \ndetentions; restrictions on freedoms of speech, press, assembly, and association; \ngovernment corruption; violence; and discrimination against women. Syrian security \nforces have placed foreign visitors under surveillance, have monitored telephones, and \nhave searched hotel rooms and possessions of foreign visitors. (Admin Not III) \n \n \nA travel warning is in effect for Syria warning U.S. citizens of ongoing safety and \nsecurity concerns in Syria. American citizens are urged to consider carefully the risks of \ntravel to Syria and to take adequate precautions to ensure their safety. (Admin Not III) \n \n \nOn February 13, 2008, President Bush expanded a 2004 Executive Order \nimplementing sanctions against Syria for its support of terrorism in the Middle East. In \nMay 2009, President Obama continued the declaration of a national emergency, \n\u201c[b]ecause the actions and policies of the Government of Syria continue to pose an \nunusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of \nthe United States.\u201d (Admin Not III) \n\n \n4 \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn her Answer to the SOR, dated August 15, 2009, Applicant admits to all the \nSOR allegations.  \n \nApplicant is a 23-year-old administrative assistant employed with a government \ncontractor who is applying for a security clearance. She has worked as an institutional \ncontractor at a government agency since October 24, 2008. This is her first time \napplying for a security clearance. She has a bachelor\u2019s degree in global health and \ndevelopment. She is single and has no children. (Tr at 42-45; Gov 1.)   \n \nApplicant was born and raised in the United States. She is a United States \ncitizen. She was educated in the United States. She does not hold dual citizenship. She \ndoes not possess a foreign passport. Both of her parents are naturalized U.S. citizens \nwho were born in Iraq. They met each other in medical school. They immigrated to the \nUnited States to complete their medical residencies in the early 1980s. They became \nUnited States citizens in 1989.  She has two older sisters who were born and raised in \nthe United States. (Tr at 37, 41-42, 77; Gov 1; Gov 3) \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother is a pathologist who works at a U.S. hospital in the city and \nstate where Applicant was born and grew up. Her father is a physician who works at a   \nhospital in Saudi Arabia. He moved to Saudi Arabia in November 2007. Applicant has \nhad no contact with her father since August 2008. She discovered that her father was \nunfaithful to her mother. Her parents are in the process of divorcing. Applicant, her \nsisters, and her mother told him that they do not wish to communicate with him. (Tr at \n39 \u2013 41, 68-69; Gov 3)  \n \nApplicant grew up speaking Arabic at home. When she graduated from college in \nthe spring of 2008, she learned of an opportunity to enhance her Arabic language skills  \nby attending a summer course at the University of Jordan that was sponsored by a \nUnited States university. The course was titled, \u201cArabic for Speakers of Other \nLanguages.\u201d  She learned about the course from her cousins who were students of the \nprofessor who sponsored the trip. About 15 students went. Her mother paid for the trip. \nWhile in Jordan, she shared an apartment with other students from the United States \nwho were taking the course. She lived in Jordan from June 2008 to August 2008. During \nher stay in Jordan, she volunteered four hours a week with the organization Doctors \nWithout Borders. Her volunteer work consisted of playing games and overseeing \nvarious educational activities with Iraqi refugee children. (Tr at 60-62; Gov 3) \n \nWhen the course ended in August 2008, Applicant\u2019s sister flew to Jordan from \nthe United States and her father flew to Jordan from Saudi Arabia.  They drove to Syria \nwhich is about two hours driving distance from Amman, Jordan. They traveled around \nSyria for three days. One evening they had dinner with Applicant\u2019s maternal uncle, his \nwife, and their three children. They are citizens of Iraq but are currently refugees in \nSyria. They left Iraq because it was unsafe. Her uncle and aunt are unemployed. The \nthree children are students.  She previously met her aunt and uncle when she was six \n\n \n5 \n \n \nyears old. She has not contacted her uncle\u2019s family since returning to the United States \nin August 2008.  She believes her mother still communicates with her uncle.  After the \nvisit to Syria, she and her sister traveled to Lebanon for several days. They also \ntraveled to Jerusalem. The purpose of their travels was for sightseeing. (Tr at 48-52, 64-\n65; Gov 3) \n \nApplicant\u2019s paternal grandfather is a citizen of Iraq. He served as head of one of \nthe Iraqi government agencies from the late 1960s to the early 1970s. He also served \nas a member of the Iraqi Parliament. Applicant does not know how long her grandfather \nserved in the Iraqi Parliament. He has not served in the Iraqi Parliament for 20 years. \nHe is over 90 years old and is in poor health. She last heard that he was seeking \nmedical treatment in Jordan.  Applicant has not had direct contract with her grandfather \nsince she was six years old. She met him only once or twice. She does not have a \nrelationship with her grandfather. In the past, she has had indirect contact with her \ngrandfather through e-mails that her grandfather sends to her sister and father. (Tr at \n46-47; Gov 3; Response to SOR)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s maternal aunt is an Iraqi citizen currently residing in Jordan. She has \nlived in Jordan as a refugee since 2001. She is unemployed and is divorcing her \nhusband. Applicant visited her aunt on several occasions during the summer of 2008 \nwhen she was studying Arabic in Jordan. She talked to her about once a week and met \nher for dinner a couple times. Previously, she met her aunt when she was about six \nyears old. She also met her in 2003, when she and her mother went on a two week \nvacation to   Turkey. They traveled to Jordan for about three days to visit her aunt. She \nhas had no contact with her aunt after leaving Jordan in August 2008. Her mother \ncommunicates with her aunt. (Tr at 52-55; Gov 3)  \n \n All of Applicant\u2019s assets are in the United States. She has no assets overseas.  \nAside from her paternal grandfather, Applicant is unaware of any extended family \nmembers working for a foreign government or in the foreign military. She does not \nprovide support to overseas relatives. She is close to her sisters and mother. She has \none friend, a United States citizen, who lives in Thailand. All of her other close friends \nlive in the United States and are United States citizens. (Tr at 56-59)  Applicant has no \nimmediate future plans to travel to the middle east.  There is a possibility that she may \ntravel to Iraq on official business in the future. Her future goal is the join the Foreign \nService. (Tr at 67)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor wrote a letter on her behalf.  She has supervised Applicant \nsince February 2009. Before her interim security clearance was revoked, most of her \ncontact with the Applicant was over the telephone because she worked at a different \nlocation. For the past two months, Applicant has worked with her in the office on a daily \nbasis. She recently completed Applicant\u2019s annual performance appraisal. She contacted \nApplicant\u2019s colleagues and immediate supervisor to seek inputs about her performance. \nApplicant received the highest marks in all categories \u2013 leadership, attitude, efficiency, \nteam spirit, and results. Applicant recently provided support to a U.S. - Iraq Business \nand Investment Conference. Feedback about Applicant\u2019s performance during the \n\n \n6 \n \n \nconference included the following: \u201c[Applicant\u2019s] exceptional organizational skills, \nsuperior communication ability in Arabic and English, professional demeanor, team \nattitude, and perseverance to get the job done were elemental to ensure [the agency\u2019s] \ngoals were accomplished, not to mention [Applicant] provided a tremendous service to \nour interagency colleagues.\u201d  Applicant\u2019s supervisor describes Applicant as dependable, \nhonest, and trustworthy. (AE A) \n \nThe program officer for supporting the Iraq mission testified on Applicant\u2019s behalf.  \nHe is a foreign service officer. He has been with the government agency since late \n2001. He has held a Top Secret security clearance for 21 years.  Applicant has worked \nin his office as a contractor since 2008. He works with her on a daily basis. Applicant \nprovides administrative and logistical support. She helps process employees who are \ndeploying to Iraq. He is not her supervisor because she is a contract employee. He has \nprovided positive feedback to her employer. She is very reliable, professional, and \ncompetent. She handles sensitive and Privacy Act information very carefully. He thinks \nof himself as Applicant\u2019s mentor.  Applicant speaks fondly of her immediate family \nmembers. He has never heard her talk about overseas relatives. He is aware that she \nhad the opportunity to travel in the area of the world where some of her relatives lived \nand that she met her family members when she was in the area. He is confident in her \nability to protect classified information. (Tr at 16-26) \n \nThe Travel and Training Coordinator for the Iraq Program also testified. She and \nApplicant started work on the same day. She possesses a Secret clearance. They \ninteract on a daily basis. She states that Applicant is exceptional. She is very grounded, \nintelligent, and dependable. She is aware that Applicant has relatives overseas.  She is \naware that Applicant\u2019s mother, two sisters, a brother-in-law, and aunts live in the United \nStates. Applicant is very devoted to her mother and sisters. She has never expressed a \npreference for overseas family members. She visited her overseas relatives in the \nsummer of 2008, because she was in that area of the world. Applicant does not drink \nalcohol or use drugs. She is trustworthy. (Tr at 27-35)  \n   \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \n\n \n7 \n \n \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision.  \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in \nAG &6:       \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism.  \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. Of the Foreign Influence Disqualifying Conditions (FI DC), the following apply \nto Applicant\u2019s case: \n \nFI DC \u00b6 7(a) (contact with a family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion) \n \nFI DC \u00b6 7(b) (connections to a foreign person, group, government, or \ncountry that create a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s \nobligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group or country by providing \nthat information) \n \nApplicant\u2019s paternal grandfather is a citizen of Iraq, who currently resides in \nJordan. In the late 1960\u2019s to the early 1970s, he served as the head of one of Iraq\u2019s \ngovernment agencies. He also served as member of the Iraqi parliament. Applicant\u2019s \nmaternal uncle, aunt, and three cousins are citizens of Iraq who currently reside in \nSyria. Her maternal aunt is a citizen of Iraq who currently resides in Jordan.  \n \nThe mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, \nas a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in \na foreign country, and an Applicant has contacts with that relative, this factor alone is \nsufficient to create a heightened risk for foreign influence and could potentially result in \nthe compromise of classified information. See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. \nFeb 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001) \n \nIn this case, FI DC \u00b6 7(a) and FI DC \u00b6 7(b) apply because Applicant has contact \nwith and connections to her family members in Iraq, Syria, and Jordan. Her extended \nfamily members are refugees from the Iraq war. Her contact with her extended family \nmembers creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, \npressure or coercion.   \n \nThree of the six mitigating conditions under the Foreign Influence guideline (FI \nMC) may apply to the facts and circumstances of this case: \n \nFI MC \u00b6 8(a) (the nature of the relationship with foreign persons, the \ncountry in which these persons are located, or the position or activities of \nthose persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will \nbe placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of a \nforeign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of \nthe U.S.)  \n \nFI MC \u00b6 8(b) (there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s \nsense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, or government, \n\n \n9 \n \n \nor country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected \nto resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest) \n \nFI MC \u00b6 8(c) (contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual \nand infrequent that there is little likelihood it could create a risk of foreign \ninfluence or exploitation) \n \nFI MC \u00b6 8(a) and FI MC \u00b6 8(c) do not apply with respect to Applicant\u2019s paternal \ngrandfather. His past status as a high ranking official under the previous Iraqi regime as \nwell as a member of parliament creates a heightened risk of foreign influence or \nexploitation. Although he is now elderly and ill and Applicant has had minimal contact \nwith her paternal grandfather, there is a remote possibility that dangerous elements \nwithin Iraq, or Jordan could attempt to use her grandfather to coerce or pressure \nApplicant.  \n \nThere is also a remote possibility that dangerous elements within Jordan or Syria \ncould attempt to use her maternal aunt who resides in Jordan, and her maternal uncle \nand his family who reside in Syria to coerce or pressure Applicant. However, Applicant\u2019s \nties to her maternal aunt who resides in Jordan and her maternal uncle and his family \nwho reside in Syria are not strong. Applicant met her extended relatives who reside in  \nSyria in August 2008, because she was studying in Jordan, only two hours from where \nthey live. She has had no contact with them since that visit and did not have regular \ncontact prior to the visit, only meeting them once before when she was six. Applicant \nhas had more contact with her aunt who resides in Jordan. However, she has had no \ncontact with her after completing the Arabic language course that she took at the \nUniversity of Jordan.  She has not had regular contact with her aunt while growing up. \nShe met her twice prior to the summer of 2008, once when she was six and once in \n2003, when she and her mother visited her aunt in conjunction with a trip to Turkey.  \n  \nRegardless of the risks based on the status of Applicant\u2019s extended relatives who \nreside in Syria and Jordan, her deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the \nUnited States support the conclusion that she can be expected to resolve any conflict in \nfavor of the United States interest. FI MC \u00b6 8(b) applies. Applicant was born and raised \nin the United States. She attended elementary, high school, and college in the United \nStates. While she studied Arabic abroad in Jordan in the summer 2008, the course was \nsponsored by a United States university. Her closest familial relationships are with her \nmother and two sisters, all of whom reside in the United States. While her father resides \nin Saudi Arabia, she has had no contact with him in over a year due to a family conflict.  \nConsidering Applicant\u2019s background and the need for personnel who speak the Arabic \nlanguage, Applicant is the ideal candidate for a security clearance despite the risks her \nextended family members who reside overseas may create. Her deep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the United States outweigh any potential for conflict. The \nGuideline B concern is mitigated. \n \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.   \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered the totality of \nApplicant\u2019s family ties to her uncle, aunt, and three cousins who are citizens of Iraq, \nresiding in Syria. I considered the totality of Applicant\u2019 family ties to her aunt who is a \ncitizen of Iraq, residing in Jordan. I considered that Applicant\u2019s paternal grandfather is a \nformer head of an Iraqi government agency and a former member of the Iraqi \nparliament. I also considered that she has had minimal contact with her paternal \ngrandfather, having met him only once when she was six.   \n \nI also considered that Applicant is highly regarded at her current place of \nemployment. She was born and raised in the United States. She was educated in the \nUnited States. The family members that she is closest to, her mother and two sisters, \nare citizens of and reside in the United States. Applicant has had minimal contact with \nher extended family members who reside overseas. She had the opportunity to visit with \nthem in the summer of 2008, when she was in the area taking an Arabic language \ncourse at the University of Jordan. The course was sponsored by a United States \nuniversity. She has had no contact with her relatives overseas since August 2008. While \nApplicant\u2019s family members living in Syria and Jordan raise a potential security threat \ndue to the very nature of familial relationships, Applicant\u2019s significant ties to the United \nStates mitigate the security threat. Her deep and longstanding relationships and \nloyalties in the United States strongly support the conclusion that Applicant would \nresolve any attempt to exert pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress in favor of the \nUnited States.   \n \nGuideline B is a security concern that affects applicants through no fault of their \nown. Applicant\u2019s family ties and the current situation in the middle east make it a \n\n \n11 \n \n \nsubstantial burden to mitigate the concerns raised under foreign influence. In \nApplicant\u2019s case, her significant personal relationships and contacts within the United \nStates outweigh the concerns raised by having relatives who are citizens of Iraq, who \ncurrently reside in Syria and Jordan. Applicant\u2019s background and Arabic language skills \nwould enhance the United States government\u2019s mission to reconstruct Iraq. Overall, the \nrecord evidence leaves no questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability \nfor a security clearance. Foreign Influence security concerns are mitigated. \n  \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n                                           \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nERIN C. HOGAN \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Hancock, Esq.\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On August 28, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\nthe basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption) and\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On March 25, 2010, after the hearing,\n\nThe Judge\u2019s favorable findings under Guideline E are not at issue in this appeal. \n1\n2\nAdministrative Judge Mark Harvey denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant\nappealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge erred in his application of\nthe pertinent mitigating conditions.   Finding no error on the existing record, we affirm.\n1\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant began consuming alcohol\nat age 15.  His alcohol consumption increased in his mid-20s.  In 1996, finding that his drinking  was\naffecting his work, he attended a few meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA).  Although he did\nnot complete the 12-step program, he did manage to control his drinking until 2002.\nIn 2002 he increased his drinking, consuming alcohol during the day in order \u201cto feel\nnormal.\u201d  Decision at 3.  He was fired from his job due to alcohol-related absenteeism and, from\n2006 until 2007, he sometimes drank a fifth of bourbon a day.  He was diagnosed as \u201calcohol\ndependent,\u201d and received inpatient alcohol detoxification therapy 10 times in the five years following\n2002.  Each treatment was followed by a return to drinking, except the last.  He has been abstinent\nsince December 2007.  \nApplicant takes issue with some of the statements in the Judge\u2019s decision.  One, for example,\nhe contends is erroneous on its face.  In the Analysis portion of the decision, the Judge stated that,\ngiven the extent of Applicant\u2019s alcohol abuse and his many relapses into drinking following inpatient\nalcohol treatment, his 27 months of abstinence since December 2007 were not sufficient to mitigate\nthe Guideline G security concerns in his case.  The Judge then stated, \u201cOne more year of abstinence\n(from the date of this decision) is needed to provide sufficient assurance that he will not return to\nalcohol consumption.\u201d  Decision at 15. \nApplicant contends that the Judge\u2019s requirement of 39 total months of sobriety to mitigate\nthe Government\u2019s Guideline G security concerns is arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law. To the\nextent that such a reading is what the Judge intended, then it is error.  However, the Board does not\nread a sentence in isolation.  ISCR Case No. 05-14488 at 4 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, 2007).  The Judge\nnoted the many positive aspects of Applicant\u2019s record, including his lengthy period of abstinence.\nHowever, he measured these against evidence that Applicant had frequently relapsed after treatment\nin the years between 2002 and 2007.  The Judge plausibly concluded that this history of relapse gave\nreason to doubt Applicant\u2019s long-term commitment to sobriety and that, accordingly, Applicant\u2019s\npresentation was not sufficient to mitigate his case under the standard set forth in Department of the\nNavy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).  This conclusion is sustainable.  In this light, the Judge\u2019s\ncomment concerning an additional year of sobriety may be simply an acknowledgment that, once an\nApplicant\u2019s clearance is denied, he is precluded from reapplying for one year.  Directive at E3.1.37.\nTo the extent that the Judge\u2019s sentence constitutes a recommendation for a future grant of a clearance\nto Applicant, based on facts not before the Judge, such a recommendation is out of place and can\nhave no binding effect on the Government.  \n\n3\nApplicant also contends that the Judge\u2019s findings satisfy the mitigating conditions per se. He\nargues that it was therefore arbitrary and capricious to deny Applicant a clearance.  For reasons set\nforth in the previous paragraph, we conclude that there is no discrepancy between the Judge\u2019s\nfindings and his ultimate adverse decision.  The Judge examined the relevant data and articulated\na satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found\nand the choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

Noel, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Kevin R. Hancock, Esquire \n \n \n \n__________ \n \nDecision \n__________ \n \nHARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant has a lengthy history of alcohol consumption and received inpatient \nalcohol-related treatment on about ten occasions from 1997 to 2007. In 2002, he was \ndiagnosed as alcohol dependent. On December 4, 2007, he stopped consuming \nalcohol. Because of his long history of excessive alcohol consumption and multiple \nrelapses, one more year of abstinence is needed to provide sufficient assurance that he \nwill not return to alcohol consumption. Applicant failed to fully mitigate security concerns \narising from alcohol consumption. Security concerns relating to personal conduct are \nmitigated. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn February 27, 2009, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) (SF 86) (Government Exhibit (GE) 1). On August 28, \n2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant, pursuant to Executive \nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, \n1960, as amended and modified; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended \nand modified; and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005.  \nMarch 25, 2010\n\n \n2 \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nThe SOR alleges security concerns under Guidelines G (alcohol consumption) \nand E (personal conduct) (Hearing Exhibit (HE) 4). The SOR detailed reasons why \nDOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for \nApplicant, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether \nApplicant\u2019s clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n \nOn September 1, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations (HE 5). \nApplicant requested a hearing before an administrative judge. On September 28, 2009, \nDepartment Counsel was ready to proceed on his case. On September 29, 2009, \nDOHA assigned Applicant\u2019s case to another administrative judge. The case was \nscheduled for a hearing on October 29, 2009; however, the hearing was cancelled due \nto excessive snow at Applicant\u2019s location (HE 3). On November 10, 2009, the case was \ntransferred to another administrative judge, and on January 7, 2010, the case was \ntransferred to me. On January 25, 2010, DOHA issued a hearing notice setting the \nhearing for February 9, 2010 (HE 2). The February 9, 2010, hearing was cancelled \nbecause of heavy snowfall in the Washington D.C. area. On February 19, 2010, DOHA \nissued a hearing notice setting the hearing for March 3, 2010 (HE 1). Applicant\u2019s \nhearing was held on March 3, 2010. At the hearing, Department Counsel offered three \nexhibits (GE 1-3) (Tr. 13-14), and Applicant offered four exhibits (Tr. 109, 145-146; AE \nA-D). Applicant did not object to the admissibility of GE 1-3 (Tr. 14). Department \nCounsel did not object to my consideration of AE A-D (Tr. 110, 146). I admitted GE 1-3 \n(Tr. 14), and AE A-D (Tr. 110, 146-147). Additionally, I admitted three hearing notices, \nthe SOR, and the response to the SOR (HE 1-5). On March 10, 2010, I received the \ntranscript. No post-hearing exhibits were offered or received (Tr. 159).   \n \nProcedural Ruling \n \nDepartment Counsel requested administrative notice of facts concerning the \ndiagnosis of major depressive disorder, dysthymic disorder, social phobia (social \nanxiety disorder), and avoidant personality disorder as discussed in the Diagnostic and \nStatistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) \nWashington, DC, American Psychiatric Association, 2000 (Administrative Exhibits \n(Admin. Ex.) I-III) (Tr. 13). Applicant objected to admission on grounds of lack of \nrelevance (Tr. 16-17). I overruled the objection; however, the documents were admitted \nfor the limited purpose of showing detail and context for these diagnoses as they relate \nto alcohol consumption (Tr. 18-19). They were not admitted to raise an independent \nsecurity concern under the psychological conditions guideline (Tr. 18-19).  \n \nAdministrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for \nadministrative proceedings. See ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4 n.1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, \n2007); ISCR Case No. 02-24875 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. \n02-18668 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2004) and McLeod v. Immigration and Naturalization  \nService, 802 F.2d 89, 93 n.4 (3d Cir. 1986)). Usually administrative notice in ISCR \nproceedings is accorded to facts that are either well known or from government reports. \nSee Stein, Administrative Law, Section 25.01 (Bender & Co. 2006) (listing fifteen types \nof facts for administrative notice).  \n\n \n3 \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nFindings of Fact1 \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, he admitted the conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a to 1.d, and he denied the allegation in SOR \u00b6 2.a (HE 5). His admissions are \nincorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the \nevidence of record, I make the following additional findings of fact.   \n \n \nApplicant is 49 years old (GE 1).2 He received a high school diploma in 1978. He \nearned a certificate of completion for computer programming from a trade school (Tr. \n90). He began his employment with his current employer in October 2007. He has been \nemployed in information technology as a software engineer and senior programmer for \nseveral years (Tr. 91-93). He has never married, and is not currently dating anyone (Tr. \n117). He has one brother. He has never served in the military. In March 2006, he left \nemployment under adverse circumstances. He has no reportable illegal drug use, \ndelinquent debts, or criminal offenses listed on his SF 86.   \n \nAlcohol consumption and rehabilitation treatment \n \nApplicant began drinking alcohol when he was 15 years old at parties and after \nfootball games (Tr. 94-95; SOR \u00b6 1.a; HE 5). He continued drinking alcohol for several \nyears (Tr. 95). When he turned 25, he began traveling extensively for his employer, and \nhis alcohol consumption increased (Tr. 95). Applicant missed work because he was \nhung over in 1996 or 1997 (Tr. 97). In about 1995 or 1996, Applicant first went to \nalcohol rehabilitation treatment (Tr. 96). He attended a few Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) \nmeetings, and he stayed sober for a year (Tr. 97-98). He did not complete AA step three \n(Tr. 137). From about 1997 to about 2002, Applicant consumed alcohol, but not \nexcessively (Tr. 98-99). In 2002, he realized he needed alcohol \u201cto feel normal\u201d (Tr. 99). \nHe began drinking alcohol at lunchtime during the duty day (Tr. 124-125). From 2002 to \n2007, he received alcohol treatment about ten times (Tr. 100; SOR \u00b6 1.b; HE 5).  \n \nIn 2006, Applicant missed work on Mondays due to alcohol consumption, and \nhad already been to alcohol-related treatment several times (Tr. 127; SOR \u00b6 1.d). In \nMarch 2006, he was fired for absenteeism (Tr. 126-127; SOR \u00b6 1.d; HE 5). Applicant \nwas unemployed from March 2006 until December 2007 (Tr. 127). He drank alcohol \noften between March 2006 and December 4, 2007, and sometimes he drank a fifth of \nbourbon in one day (Tr. 128, 129). \n \nApplicant has never been arrested for any alcohol-related conduct (Tr. 96). \nApplicant\u2019s history of alcohol consumption caused him to be estranged from his parents \nand brother (Tr. 101). Applicant did not hide or conceal his alcoholism from his \ncoworkers (Tr. 102-105). Although he attended AA meetings five times per week \nseveral years ago, Applicant was not that serious about changing, and was just \u201calong \n \n1Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits.  \n \n2 Applicant\u2019s SF 86 (GE 1) is the source for the facts in this paragraph, unless stated otherwise. \n \n\n \n4 \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nfor the ride\u201d (Tr. 141). He attended the meetings; however, he did not actively \nparticipate in the AA meetings (Tr. 142). In December 2007, he really did change and \nhe stopped drinking alcohol (Tr. 52-53, 57, 142).  \n \nW has known Applicant for 18 years (Tr. 44). W dated Applicant for a year (Tr. \n44). They have maintained a friendly relationship over the years (Tr. 44-45). They work \nout at the gym twice a week (Tr. 53). W\u2019s father was an alcoholic, and she understands \nand recognizes this disease (Tr. 46). At first, Applicant\u2019s alcohol consumption was at a \nresponsible, social level (Tr. 46-47). Later, his alcohol consumption increased, and he \nstarted missing work (Tr. 47). Applicant received alcohol treatment on several occasions \n(Tr. 49). Applicant is shy, quiet, and not social, even at social affairs (Tr. 50, 59). He \nwas socially isolated (Tr. 58). Most of his alcohol consumption was at his home (Tr. 51). \nHe has had intervals where he abstained from alcohol (Tr. 51). For example, about four \nyears ago, he did not drink alcohol for 18 months (Tr. 51). Previously he abstained from \nalcohol consumption for one year before he resumed his alcohol consumption. In the \nlast 27 months, he has made important changes. He has lost weight, stopped smoking, \nand is now in excellent physical condition (Tr. 54). He has more friends from the gym \nand AA (Tr. 55). He attends church with his brother (Tr. 55). He has a good relationship \nwith his parents and brother; whereas, when he was drinking alcohol, his relationship \nwith family was estranged (Tr. 56). Applicant was always honest about his alcohol \nconsumption and his alcohol-related treatment (Tr. 61, 62). \n \nApplicant ended his alcohol consumption on December 4, 2007, because he was \ntired of drinking alcohol (Tr. 102, 107, 111, 129, 143). His life was not progressing and \n\u201cit wasn\u2019t fun anymore\u201d (Tr. 107, 129). He decided he needed to change or he would die \n(Tr. 108). He used up his savings and borrowed $18,000 from his parents (Tr. 129-130). \nHe has paid his parents $6,000 and will repay the rest in two years (Tr. 130). He \nchecked himself into an alcohol rehabilitation treatment program, where he stayed for \nthree weeks (Tr. 108, 111). His follow-up treatment at AA had a very positive influence \non his life (Tr. 113). He became less fearful and more confident (Tr. 113-114). He is \nnow an avid runner and hiker (Tr. 115). He has lost 30 pounds (Tr. 118). He is not \ncomfortable going to bars (Tr. 117). He is much more comfortable being in a social \nsetting and meeting people (Tr. 136). His outlook is more positive, and his life is much \nhappier (Tr. 136). He attends AA meetings four to seven times per week (Tr. 114, 135). \nApplicant recently received a two-year chip for his AA attendance and abstention from \nalcohol consumption (Tr. 115). He recently learned he was diabetic (Tr. 118). \nConsumption of alcohol risks potential adverse side affects because of his other \nmedications (Tr. 119).  \n \nOn October 21, 2009, a Doctor of Osteopathy (DO) signed a letter indicating \nApplicant was diagnosed with alcoholism (AE A). Applicant successfully completed \ninpatient rehabilitation treatment and required aftercare (AE A). There have been no \nrelapses since December 2007 (AE A). Applicant continues to be an active member of \nAA (AE A). He has not seen the DO for medical or alcohol-related treatment since \nDecember 2007 (Tr. 112). \n \n\n \n5 \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nApplicant has been taking medication for his anxiety for the last four to five years \n(Tr. 132). His fears and social phobias have been reduced since he stopped consuming \nalcohol (Tr. 133). Applicant believes there is less than a five percent chance he will \nreturn to alcohol consumption (Tr. 145). \n \nApplicant\u2019s older brother (B) discovered Applicant was having problems coping \nwith his alcohol consumption in the mid-1990s (Tr. 67). They lived in different states and \ncommunicated with each other about once a month (Tr. 67). Once they lived in the \nsame state, their contact became much more frequent (Tr. 68, 69, 71). B took Applicant \nto an alcohol-rehabilitation clinic on several occasions (Tr. 68, 69). Their relationship \nwas strained because of his alcohol consumption (Tr. 73). Their relationship has \ndramatically improved since Applicant stopped his alcohol consumption (Tr. 72). B and \nApplicant attend church together every Sunday (Tr. 71). Applicant is more friendly and \nsociable now (Tr. 72, 76, 77). He is more physically fit (Tr. 74, 75). His outlook is more \npositive and hopeful, and he is happy (Tr. 75, 88). He has significantly changed for the \nbetter over the past 30 months (Tr. 74). Applicant was always open and honest about \nhis alcohol consumption and treatments (Tr. 78). Applicant previously returned to \nalcohol consumption after being abstinent for 18 months (Tr. 81-82). B thought \nApplicant hit rock bottom in late 2007, and he was finally serious about ending his \nalcohol consumption (Tr. 84-85). He made amends with others, and he never did that \nbefore when he was abstinent (Tr. 85-86). He learned that he does not need alcohol as \na social crutch (Tr. 87). Although B could not absolutely rule out Applicant\u2019s return to \nalcohol consumption, he did not believe he would return to alcohol because of all the \npositive changes in his life (Tr. 79-80).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s friend describes him as sober, generous, dependable, and caring. \nShe recommends reinstatement of his security clearance (AE B).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s operations manager, a retired U.S. Army major general, indicates \nApplicant has worked for him since April 7, 2008 (AE C). Applicant \u201chas been a primary \nimplementer of some of our most innovative products .  .  .  . [He is] a both a competent \ndeveloper and presenter for the software that he builds and maintains\u201d (AE C). \nApplicant is an intelligent, reliable, and responsible person (AE C). He recommends \nreinstatement of Applicant\u2019s security clearance (AE C). \n \nApplicant\u2019s program manager has known Applicant since April 2008 (AE D). He \nlauds Applicant\u2019s work performance as diligent and dependable. Applicant has excellent \nfitness and trustworthiness. His conduct shows conscientious responsibility (AE D). He \nhas observed Applicant\u2019s abstinent behavior\u2014specifically, Applicant has rejected offers \nof alcohol at social events (AE D). His program manager has worked for the Department \nof Defense as a Marine and contractor for more than 30 years, and he recommends \napproval of Applicant\u2019s security clearance (AE D). \n    \nMedical records \n \n \nOn July 12, 2002, Applicant was admitted for inpatient alcohol treatment (GE 3 at \n64). His history indicates Applicant was detoxified from alcohol three times over the \n\n \n6 \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nprevious summer (of 2002) (GE 3 at 64). In July 2002, his physician diagnosed \nApplicant as alcohol dependent (GE 3 at 62, 66; SOR \u00b6 1.c; HE 5). His July 16, 2002, \ndischarge summary states: \n \n[H]e has been unable to maintain any sort of prolonged sobriety. He has \nbeen detoxed at [redacted] multiple times and has been in the intensive \noutpatient programs but continues to relapse and experience ongoing \ndifficulties.  .  .  .  He certainly does have ongoing difficulties with severe \nalcohol dependency that is complicated by what appears to be an \navoidance/social phobic combination that makes it even more difficult for \nhim to manage when he is sober. (GE 3 at 62). \n \n \nApplicant was most recently an inpatient for alcohol treatment from December 4-\n14, 2007 (GE 3 at 12). The admission notes indicated that he most recently completed \nalcohol detoxification in May 2007 (GE 3 at 14). Applicant is drinking alcohol on a \nregular basis. The history states, \u201che will drink a quart to a half gallon per day, has to \ndrink in the morning, cannot stop because of withdrawals. He\u2019s had significant \nwithdrawal difficulties in the past with deliriums, agitation, nausea, although he\u2019s not \nreported seizures\u201d (GE 3 at 14). His blood alcohol on admission was .210 (GE 3 at 15). \nHis discharge summary notes: \n \nUnfortunately, his alcohol dependency is complicated by an avoidant \npersonality disorder that makes it difficult for him to integrate into a 12-\nstep program. Over the last few years, [Applicant] has been able to \nmaintain longer and longer sobriety.  .  .  . I am hoping he is inching his \nway toward longer term recovery and it certainly appears that this is a \npossibility.  \n \nAxis I states, \u201cAlcohol withdrawal \u2013 severe, Alcohol dependency \u2013 depressive \ndisorder NOS. Mixed anxiety disorder\u201d (GE 3 at 13). \n \nAxis II states, \u201cAvoidant personality disorder\u201d (GE 3 at 13).  \n \nAxis III includes, \u201cAlcoholic hepatitis\u201d (GE 3 at 13).      \n \nApplicant\u2019s Alcoholics Anonymous sponsor\u2019s statement  \n \nApplicant\u2019s Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) sponsor (S) has a distinguished \neducational and corporate background, including two masters degrees, and he has held \na top secret clearance (Tr. 21-22, 25). S is an alcoholic; however, S has been abstinent \nfrom alcohol consumption for 11 years (Tr. 22). S has been involved with AA for 20 \nyears (Tr. 23). S stayed sober for brief periods of time and then relapsed before finally \nstopping his alcohol consumption 11 years ago (Tr. 23). S\u2019s alcohol dependency is not \ncured and never will be; however, it is currently in remission (Tr. 23-24).  \n \nS has known Applicant as part of AA meetings for three or four years (Tr. 22, 30). \nS believes Applicant has changed (Tr. 25). When he first met Applicant, Applicant was \n\n \n7 \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \ndepressed, withdrawn, defeated, had low self-esteem, and appeared to be unhealthy \n(Tr. 26, 32, 33). Applicant attended AA meetings, and then he left AA for awhile (Tr. 38). \nApplicant would then return to AA attendance (Tr. 38). Applicant\u2019s confidence, \nemotional awareness, and self-awareness of his alcohol dependence have increased \nsince December 2007 (Tr. 25, 28). He has lost weight, and he has a better relationship \nwith his family and friends (Tr. 35). He is healthier now (Tr. 26, 33, 34). He used to meet \nwith Applicant on a daily basis, then it was weekly, and now it is \u201cbi-weekly-ish\u201d (Tr. 27). \nHe believed Applicant attended meetings five days a week (Tr. 36). Applicant has some \nAA chips to show his continued sobriety (Tr. 37). He is now at an AA maintenance level \n(AA steps 10-12) (Tr. 37). He believed Applicant has been abstinent for 27 months (Tr. \n27). The probability that Applicant would return to alcohol consumption was low\u2014less \nthan a one-in-four probability (Tr. 42). He recommended approval of Applicant\u2019s security \nclearance because he believes Applicant is honest and trustworthy (Tr. 29).    \n \nFalsification of security clearance application \n \nOn February 27, 2009,3 Applicant completed his security clearance application \n(SF 86) (GE 1) (Tr. 121). Section 25 asks, \u201cIn the last 7 years has your use of alcoholic \nbeverages (such as liquor, beer, wine) resulted in any alcohol-related treatment or \ncounseling (such as for alcohol abuse or alcoholism)?\u201d Applicant answered, \u201cYes,\u201d and \ndisclosed treatment in December 2007 at a nearby alcohol treatment program, and he \nprovided the name of his counselor (GE 1). He did not disclose that he had received \nalcohol-related treatment on about ten other occasions (Tr. 105-106).  \n \nOn May 7, 2008, an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator \ninterviewed Applicant and Applicant disclosed that he received alcohol-related treatment \nat a nearby treatment facility on \u201cfive or seven occasions over the last seven years\u201d (Tr. \n107; GE 2 at 3). He explained that he did not list the additional treatments on his SF 86 \nbecause of lack of space on his SF 86 (Tr. 105-106, 107). He did not notice the \nAdditional Comments section after Section 30 of his SF 86 (Tr. 121). He believed that \nhe may have mentioned to his security officer that he was unable to fully disclose his \nalcohol-related treatment because of lack of space on his SF 86 (Tr. 122). He believed \nthe security officer advised him to tell the investigator when he was interviewed (Tr. \n122). He understood even before he completed his SF 86 that he had to disclose all \ninformation requested (Tr. 105).  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \n \n3An Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator interviewed Applicant on May 7, 2008, \nand October 22, 2008 (GE 2 at 3-14). He disclosed his prior alcohol treatments in detail to the OPM \ninvestigator (GE 2). Applicant believed the reason his SF 86 was dated after his OPM interview was \nbecause he provided the copy at GE 1 to his security officer on February 27, 2009 (Tr. 137-141; GE 1).  \n\n \n8 \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the Applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the [A]pplicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, \nnothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, \nin whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, \nloyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has not met the strict \nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a \nclearance. \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the Applicant that may disqualify the Applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an Applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the Applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An Applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n\n \n9 \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security \nconcerns are under Guidelines G (alcohol consumption) and E (personal conduct) with \nrespect to the allegations set forth in the SOR. \n \nAlcohol Consumption \n \n \nAG \u00b6 21 articulates the Government\u2019s concern about alcohol consumption, \n\u201c[e]xcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment \nor the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability \nand trustworthiness.\u201d \n  \n \n  \nSeven Alcohol Consumption disqualifying conditions could raise a security or \ntrustworthiness concern and may be disqualifying in this case. AG \u00b6 22 provides:   \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent; \n \n(b) alcohol-related incidents at work, such as reporting for work or duty in \nan intoxicated or impaired condition, or drinking on the job, regardless of \nwhether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol \ndependent; \n \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol \nabuser or alcohol dependent; \n \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional (e.g., physician, \nclinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of alcohol abuse or alcohol \ndependence; \n \n(e) evaluation of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence by a licensed \nclinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol \ntreatment program; \n \n(f) relapse after diagnosis of alcohol abuse or dependence and completion \nof an alcohol rehabilitation program; and \n \n(g) failure to follow any court order regarding alcohol education, \nevaluation, treatment, or abstinence. \n \n\n \n10 \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a), 22(e), and 22(g) do not apply. Applicant did not have any alcohol-\nrelated incidents involving police intervention or arrest. A licensed clinical social worker \ndid not diagnose Applicant as alcohol dependent. Applicant has not failed to comply \nwith a court order not to consume alcohol. \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 22(b), 22(c), 22(d), and 22(f) apply. Applicant missed work due to \nexcessive alcohol consumption and was fired in March 2006. His alcohol consumption \nproblem was diagnosed as alcohol dependent4 \u201cby a duly qualified medical professional \n(e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist).\u201d He had multiple relapses after \ndiagnosis of alcohol dependence, detoxification, and treatment. In the past, Applicant \nhabitually consumed alcohol to the point of impaired judgment. His binge alcohol \nconsumption over many years and repeated relapses after treatment raise profound \nsecurity concerns.     \n \n  \n\u201cOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, \nthere is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 07-00852 at 3 (App. Bd. May 27, 2008) (citing Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 \nF.2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990)). Because the government has met its initial burden \n \n4The well-respected psychiatric reference, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, \nFourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR). Washington, DC, American Psychiatric Association, 2000, \nhas defined \u201calcohol dependence\u201d to be a psychiatric condition that meets the following diagnostic \ncriteria:  \n  \nA maladaptive pattern of alcohol use, leading to clinically significant impairment or \ndistress, as manifested by three (or more) of the following, occurring at any time in the \nsame 12-month period:  \n \n(1) Tolerance, as defined by either of the following: (a) a need for markedly increased \namounts of the alcohol to achieve intoxication or desired effect; or (b) markedly \ndiminished effect with continued use of the same amount of the alcohol.  \n \n(2) Withdrawal, as manifested by either of the following: (a) the characteristic withdrawal \nsyndrome for the alcohol; or (b) the same (or a closely related) alcohol is taken to relieve \nor avoid withdrawal symptoms.  \n \n(3) The alcohol is often taken in larger amounts or over a longer period than was \nintended.  \n \n(4) There is a persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to cut down or control alcohol use.  \n \n(5) A great deal of time is spent in activities necessary to obtain the alcohol (e.g., visiting \nmultiple doctors or driving long distances), use the alcohol or recover from its effects.  \n \n(6) Important social, occupational, or recreational activities are given up or reduced \nbecause of alcohol use.  \n \n(7) The alcohol use is continued despite knowledge of having a persistent or recurrent \nphysical or psychological problem that is likely to have been caused or exacerbated by \nthe alcohol (e.g., continued drinking despite recognition that an ulcer was made worse by \nalcohol consumption). \n \nAvailable at http://www.rma.gov.au/SOP/08/017.pdf. \n\n \n11 \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nconcerning alcohol consumption security concerns, the burden now shifts to Applicant \nto establish any appropriate mitigating conditions. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. \n \n  \nFour Alcohol Consumption mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 23 are potentially \napplicable:  \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment; \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol \nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or \nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser); \n \n(c) the individual is a current employee who is participating in a counseling \nor treatment program, has no history of previous treatment and relapse, \nand is making satisfactory progress; and \n \n(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient \ncounseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as \nparticipation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar \norganization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff \nmember of a recognized alcohol treatment program. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 23(b) and 23(d) apply; however, AG \u00b6\u00b6 23(a) and 23(c) do not apply. \nApplicant began consumption of alcohol at age 15 and he continued to consume alcohol \nwith periods of abstinence of up to 18 months for the next 32 years. Applicant was \ndiagnosed with alcohol dependency in July 2002. He received alcohol treatment on \nabout ten occasions, and always had a relapse, until his December 2007 treatment. He \nacknowledges his alcohol dependency. He has now been abstinent from alcohol \nconsumption for 27 months (since December 4, 2007). He completed the December \n2007 alcohol treatment. He completed the 12-step AA program. He attends AA \nmeetings at least five times a week, and he received a positive prognosis from a \nphysician, who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol treatment program. He is \nmaking satisfactory progress in his alcohol rehabilitation program. He has established a \npattern of abstinence. Despite these very positive developments, his extensive pattern \nof alcohol abuse, rehabilitative treatment, and relapse continue to cast doubt on his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. Alcohol consumption concerns are \nnot fully mitigated for the reasons stated in the whole person concept, infra. \n \n \n\n \n12 \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nPersonal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning \nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent \nmedical authority, or other official government representative. \n \nApplicant failed to disclose his alcohol-related treatment before December 2007 \non his February 27, 2009, SF 86 (SOR \u00b6 2.a). AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) and 16(b) both apply. AG \u00b6 \n17 provides seven conditions that could mitigate security concerns in this case: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n\n \n13 \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress;  \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or \noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules \nand regulations. \n  \nMitigating conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(a) and 17(f) fully apply to the allegation that \nApplicant falsified his answer to the question on his SF 86 about his alcohol-related \ntreatment before December 2007. He admitted preparing his February 27, 2009, SF 86. \nHe provided derogatory information that placed the Department of Defense (DoD) on \nnotice of his alcohol-related problems. He provided information about being fired in \nMarch 2006, and his alcohol-related treatment in December 2007. He did not add \nadditional information about his alcohol-related treatment because he did not see space \non his SF 86 for this information. He fully disclosed his alcohol treatment to an OPM \ninvestigator in 2008.5 He signed medical privacy waivers permitting DoD to obtain his \nalcohol-treatment records. I found his statement at the hearing to be credible. At the \ntime he provided this particular incomplete information to security officials on his SF 86, \nhe thought that the answer he provided met requirements. He did not intend to violate \nthe rules, and did not have the necessary intent to deceive to establish the disqualifying \nconduct. Applicant has provided sufficient information to unsubstantiate the allegation in \nSOR \u00b6 2.a.   \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n5The Appeal Board has cogently explained the process for analyzing falsification cases, stating:\n \n(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has the burden of \nproving falsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove \nan applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the omission occurred; and (c) a Judge must \nconsider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or \ncircumstantial evidence concerning the applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the \nomission occurred. [Moreover], it was legally permissible for the Judge to conclude \nDepartment Counsel had established a prima facie case under Guideline E and the \nburden of persuasion had shifted to the applicant to present evidence to explain the \nomission.  \n \nISCR Case No. 03-10380 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 6, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-23133 (App. Bd. June 9, \n2004)).  \n\n \n14 \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines G and E in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) \nwere addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nAlthough there is some evidence supporting approval of Applicant\u2019s clearance, \nthe mitigation evidence is insufficient to resolve security concerns at this time. Applicant \ncontributes to his company and the Department of Defense. There is no evidence of any \ndisciplinary problems unrelated to alcohol-consumption, arrests or convictions, or any \ndrug abuse. There is no evidence of financial problems, disloyalty, or that he would \nintentionally violate national security. His character and good work performance show \nsome responsibility, rehabilitation, and mitigation. His supervisors evidently support him \nor he would not have been able to retain his employment after his security clearance \nwas called into question. He provided supportive statements from his project manager \nand operations manager, two very credible and impressive witnesses, who support \nretention of his security clearance. Applicant knows the consequences of excessive \nalcohol consumption. He has not had any alcohol-related offenses involving the police \nor the courts. He acknowledges his alcohol dependency. He has now been abstinent \nfrom alcohol consumption for 27 months (since December 4, 2007), which is a very \npositive development. He recognizes the importance of overcoming his alcohol \nproblems and has established a pattern of abstinence.6 He completed the December \n2007 alcohol treatment program and the 12-step AA program. He attends AA meetings \nat least five times a week, and he received a positive prognosis from a physician, who is \na staff member of a recognized alcohol treatment program. He is making satisfactory \nprogress in his alcohol rehabilitation program.   \n \n \n6For example, in ISCR Case No. 05-16753 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Aug. 2, 2007) the Appeal Board \nreversed the administrative judge\u2019s grant of a clearance and noted, \u201cThat Applicant continued to drink \neven after his second alcohol related arrest vitiates the Judge\u2019s application of MC 3.\u201d  In ISCR Case No. \n05-10019 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2007), the Appeal Board reversed an administrative judge\u2019s grant of a \nclearance to an applicant (AB) where AB had several alcohol-related legal problems. However, AB\u2019s most \nrecent DUI was in 2000, six years before an administrative judge decided AB\u2019s case. AB had reduced his \nalcohol consumption, but still drank alcohol to intoxication, and sometimes drank alcohol (not to \nintoxication) before driving. The Appeal Board determined that AB\u2019s continued alcohol consumption was \nnot responsible, and the grant of AB\u2019s clearance was arbitrary and capricious. See also ISCR Case No. \n04-12916 at 2-6 (App. Bd. Mar. 21, 2007) (involving case with most recent alcohol-related incident three \nyears before hearing, and reversing administrative judge\u2019s grant of a clearance). \n\n \n15 \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nThe evidence against approval of Applicant\u2019s clearance is more substantial at \nthis time. Applicant has had a problem with alcohol use beginning when he was 15 \nyears old. He ended his alcohol consumption when he was 47. He has consumed \nalcohol at times to excess, with some periods of abstinence, for 32 years. On December \n4, 2007, when he began his most recent alcohol treatment his entry blood alcohol level \nwas .210. A physician diagnosed him with being severely dependent on alcohol. He \nreceived intensive, inpatient alcohol detoxification therapy on about ten occasions; \nhowever, he had a relapse after all of those treatments except for the most recent \nsession. His two longest periods of abstinence from alcohol consumption after the age \nof 15 are 18 months and 27 months, the current period of abstinence. His severe \nalcohol dependence and alcohol consumption is described in the alcohol-treatment \nnotes, admission, and discharge summaries of his alcohol-treatment program.7 \nStatements from colleagues, friends, his AA sponsor, and a family member about his \nalcohol consumption and rehabilitation as well as changes in his social circumstances \nwere very helpful and corroborated Applicant\u2019s statements.  \n \nSecurity clearance cases are difficult to compare, especially under Guideline G, \nbecause the facts, degree, and timing of the alcohol abuse and rehabilitation show \nmany different permutations. The Appeal Board has determined in cases of substantial \nalcohol abuse that full mitigation of security concerns is not possible unless there was a \nfairly lengthy period of abstaining from alcohol consumption.8 Applicant\u2019s alcohol \nconsumption is not recent; however, his past excessive alcohol consumption was \nfrequent, extreme, and of long duration. His extensive rehabilitative efforts and changes \nin behavior are important manifestations reducing concerns. However, his history of \nalcohol consumption is extensive, and his relapses after about ten inpatient treatments \nare not infrequent. Accordingly, the likelihood of recurrence of alcohol consumption is \nstill sufficiently probable to require more time with continued abstinence. Lingering \ndoubts remain concerning his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. One \nmore year of abstinence (from the date of this decision) is needed to provide sufficient \nassurance that he will not return to alcohol consumption. 9 \n \nI conclude Applicant has not fully mitigated the security concerns pertaining to \nalcohol consumption. He has mitigated security concerns relating to personal conduct. I \n \n7See Federal Rule of Evidence 803(4) and commentary explaining why statements made to \nobtain medical treatment are deemed reliable. \n \n8See ISCR Case No. 06-17541 at 3-5 (App. Bd. Jan. 14, 2008); ISCR Case No. 06-08708 at 5-7 \n(App. Bd. Dec. 17, 2007); ISCR Case No. 04-10799 at 2-4 (App. Bd. Nov. 9, 2007).   \n \n9Of course, my recommendation to approve Applicant\u2019s clearance in the future is not binding on \nthe government. If Applicant\u2019s company sponsors him for a clearance one year after the date of this \nclearance, approval of a clearance at that time will be based on all the facts and circumstances at that \npoint in time. An administrative judge does not have authority to commit the government to approval of a \nclearance at some future date. See generally ISCR Case No. 08-07540 at 2 (App. Bd. Jan. 8, 2010); \nISCR Case No. 04-03907 at 2 (App. Bd.

Coacher, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nMarch 31, 2010\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLOKEY ANDERSON, Darlene D., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted her Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP) on November 21, 2008.  (Government Exhibit 4).  On July 1, 2009, the Defense\nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, (as\namended) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed\nreasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the\nDirective that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for the Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative\nJudge to determine whether clearance should be denied or revoked.\nThe Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on August 12, 2009, in which she\nelected to have the case determined on a written record in lieu of a hearing.\nDepartment Counsel submitted  the Government\u2019s File of Relevant Material (FORM) to\nthe Applicant on September 11, 2009.  The Applicant was instructed to submit\ninformation in rebuttal, extenuation or mitigation within 30 days of receipt.  Applicant\nreceived the FORM on September 22, 2009, and she submitted no reply.  The case was\noriginally assigned to another Administrative Judge on December 4, 2009.  The matter\nwas transferred to the undersigned for resolution on February 1, 2010.  Based upon a\nreview of the case file, pleadings and exhibits eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is denied.\n\n2\n FINDINGS OF FACT\nThe Applicant is 57 years old and has a high school diploma.  She is employed\nby a defense contractor as an Administrator, and is seeking to obtain a security\nclearance in connection with her employment.\nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the\nbasis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The following findings\nof fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR:\nParagraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations)  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because she is financially overextended and at risk\nof  having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.      \nThe Applicant admits twelve of the thirteen past due debts and judgments set\nforth in the SOR under this paragraph, that include allegations 1(a) through 1(m), except\nallegation 1(j).  Credit reports of the Applicant dated June 18, 2009, and December 3,\n2008, indicate that she remains indebted in the amount of approximately $282,822.00.\n(Government Exhibits 6 and 7).  Applicant claims that the debts were incurred as a\nresult of a failed catering business due to the bad economy.  (Government Exhibit 3).\nShe states that she became excessively indebted and also lost her house in\nforeclosure.  She indicates that she has filed a petition in Bankruptcy and plans to\ndischarge all of the debts in the SOR.  Applicant provided a copy of a letter from her\nattorneys indicating that her Bankruptcy petition was filed on July 10, 2009.\n(Government Exhibit 3).  Her meeting of creditors was scheduled for August 19, 2009.\nShe is awaiting a final discharge of her debts.  She also submitted a copy of a certificate\nindicating that she has participated in the mandatory debtor education class in\nconnection with her bankruptcy.  (Government Exhibit 3).  \nApplicant received the FORM on September 22, 2009, and was given the\nopportunity to respond to the FORM concerning the present status of her bankruptcy\ncase, which is critical in this case.  (See file).  Her response was due by October 22,\n2009, but she failed to respond.  There is no evidence in the record to substantiate a\nfailed business or that any of the delinquent debts in the SOR were in fact discharged\nby the court.  Thus, the delinquent debts remain outstanding.  Applicant\u2019s financial\nhistory shows no track record of financial responsibility.  Furthermore, there is no\nevidence in the record as to whether she has sufficient income at this time, even if the\ndebts are considered discharged, to pay her current monthly expenses in a timely\nmanner.      \n        \n\n3\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies divided into\n\"Disqualifying Factors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying Factors\nand Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations)\n18.  The Concern.  Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to\nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  An individual who\nis financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds. \nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n19.(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; \n19.(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n20.(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond\nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected\nmedical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted\nresponsibly under the circumstances;\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 18-19,  in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\n a.  The nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct;\n     b.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation;\nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct;\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;\ne.  The extent to which participation is voluntary;\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavior\nchanges;\n\n4\ng.  The motivation for the conduct; \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress; and\n \ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\nan acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicated\nupon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative\nprocess is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person\nconcept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable\nand unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions\nbased on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order\n. . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned.\u201d\nCONCLUSION\nIn the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to\ncivilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information\ntwenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore\nappropriately concerned when available information indicates that an Applicant for\nclearance may be involved in instances of financial irresponsibility which demonstrates\npoor judgment or unreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the\nholding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then\nshifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation\nwhich is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The Applicant\nbears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant her a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the\nApplicant has been financially irresponsible (Guideline F).  This evidence indicates poor\njudgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.  Because of\n\n5\nthe scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude there is a nexus or\nconnection with her security clearance eligibility.\nConsidering all of the evidence, the Applicant has failed to introduce persuasive\nevidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the\nGovernment's case.  Under the circumstances, she has failed to make a good faith\neffort to resolve her indebtedness, because she failed to submit sufficient documentary\nevidence to support her allegations.  Applicant contends that the debts listed in the SOR\nare in her bankruptcy petition and that they will be discharged at some future date.  She\ndid not submit a copy of the actual bankruptcy petition, nor did she respond to the\nFORM to provide the court with additional documentary information concerning the\nstatus of her delinquent debts.  She failed to provided any evidence other than the letter\nfrom her attorneys that a petition in bankruptcy was filed and a meeting of the creditors\nwas scheduled that required her appearance.  Without more, it is impossible to\ndetermine that the Applicant has resolved her indebtedness, or that she is sufficiently\nfinancially responsible for access to classified information.  She has failed to\ndemonstrate that she can properly handle her financial affairs.\nUnder Guideline F (Financial Considerations), Disqualifying Conditions 19.(a)\ninability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; 19.(c) a history of not meeting financial\nobligations apply.  Although there is some evidence that Mitigating Condition 20.(b) the\nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s\ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical\nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly\nunder the circumstances may apply, it is insufficient in this case based upon the large\namount of debt and the Applicant\u2019s failure to provide sufficient documentary evidence of\nher failed business.  Accordingly, I find against the Applicant under Guideline F\n(Financial Considerations).    \n \nI have also considered the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d in evaluating the Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.  Under the particular facts of this case, the\ntotality of the conduct set forth under all of the guidelines viewed as a whole, support a\nwhole person assessment of poor judgement, untrustworthiness, unreliability, a lack a\ncandor, and an unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, and/or other\ncharacteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard classified\ninformation.\n  \nI have considered all of the evidence presented and it does not sufficiently\nmitigate the adverse information brought against her.  On balance, it is concluded that\nthe Applicant has failed to overcome the Government's case opposing her request for a\nsecurity clearance.  Accordingly, the evidence supports a finding against the Applicant\nas to the factual and conclusionary allegations expressed in Paragraph 1 of the SOR.    \n\n6\n     \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: \nAgainst the Applicant.\n    \n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.b.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.c.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n       \n    Subpara.  1.d.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.e.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.f.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.g.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.h.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.i.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n       \n    Subpara.  1.j.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.j.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.k.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.l.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n       \n    Subpara.  1.m.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n   \n   \nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for\nthe Applicant.\n  Darlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Michael Lyles, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se  \n______________\nDecision\n______________\nHENRY, Mary E., Administrative Judge:\nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I deny\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nApplicant signed an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP) version of a security clearance application (SF-86) on August 2, 2008. The\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of\nReasons (SOR)  on December 21, 2009, detailing security concerns under Guideline F\n(Financial Considerations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) that provided the basis\nfor its preliminary decision to deny him a security clearance. The action was taken\nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented on September\n1, 2006. \n \nDecember 9, 2010\n\nW hen  SOR allegations are controverted, the government bears the burden of producing evidence sufficient\n1\nto prove controverted allegations. Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.14. \u201cThat burden has two components. First, the\ngovernment must establish by substantial evidence that the facts and events alleged in the SOR indeed took\nplace. Second, the government must establish a nexus between the existence of the established facts and\nevents and a legitimate security concern.\u201d See ISCR Case No. 07-18525 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 18, 2009),\n(concurring and dissenting, in part) (citations omitted). The guidelines presume a nexus or rational connection\nbetween proven conduct under any of the criteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See\nISCR Case No. 08-06605 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 4, 2010); ISCR Case No. 08-07290 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 17,\n2009).\nGE 1; Tr. 19, 32.\n2\nGE 1; Tr. 19-20.\n3\n2\nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on May 1, 2010. He answered the\nSOR in writing and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. DOHA received\nthe request and Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on August 2, 2010, and I\nreceived the case assignment on August 11, 2010. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on\nAugust 30, 2010, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on September 15, 2010.\nThe Government offered exhibits (GE) 1 through 7, which were admitted into evidence\nwithout objection. Applicant testified, but he did not submit any exhibits. DOHA received\nthe transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on September 22, 2010. I held the record open until\nSeptember 30, 2010, for Applicant to submit additional matters. Applicant timely\nsubmitted Exhibits (AE) A through D, which were admitted without objection. The record\nclosed on September 30, 2010.\nProcedural Ruling\nNotice\nApplicant received the hearing notice less than 15 days before the hearing. (Tr.\n10.) I advised Applicant of his right under \u00b6 E3.1.8 of the Directive to 15 days notice\nbefore the hearing. Applicant affirmatively waived his right to 15 days notice. (Id.) \nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.i\nof the SOR. His admissions are incorporated as findings of fact. He denied the factual\nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 2.a-2.c of the SOR  After a complete and thorough review of the\n1\nevidence of record, I make the following additional findings of fact.  \nApplicant, who is 37 years old, works in security for a Department of Defense\ncontractor. He began his employment with his current employer in October 2005. He is\nrequired to work outside the United States ten months of the year.2\nApplicant graduated from high school and worked in the trucking industry for\nmany years. He married in 1996. He has three children, ages 16, 13, and 9.  \n3\n\nGE 7; Tr. 25.\n4\n Response to SOR; GE 2; Tr. 22. \n5\nGE 2; GE 4; AE B; Tr. 23.\n6\nResponse to SOR; GE 4 - GE 6; Tr. 23, 24-25.\n7\nGE 2; Tr. 24-25.\n8\n3\nApplicant and his wife filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 13 of the\nbankruptcy code in April 2000 because his wife lost her job and they could not pay their\nbills. The court dismissed their petition in August 2000. Applicant indicated that they\ncould not afford the monthly payments established by the court.4\nWhen his wife lost her job in 2000, Applicant could not longer afford the monthly\npayments on his car, which was repossessed later that year. The creditor filed a court\naction to recover the money owed and obtained a judgment against Applicant in\nSeptember 2005. Applicant has not paid this $20,000 judgment. He advised the Office\nof Personnel Management (OPM) investigator that he contacted the creditor to resolve\nthe debt, but the creditor rejected his offer, and he could not afford the creditor\u2019s\nsuggested payment. He did not mention this offer at the hearing.  (SOR \u00b6 1.c)\n5\nIn 2005, his wife did not make her car payments and her car was repossessed.\nBecause this loan account was a joint debt, the creditor filed suit against Applicant and\nhis wife and obtained a judgment against them in January 2007. The creditor collected\nthe judgment money through a garnishment of his wife\u2019s paycheck. This judgment was\npaid in full as of February 2010.  (SOR \u00b6 1.d)\n6\nApplicant defaulted on two additional debts listed in the SOR many years ago.\nThe date of last activity for the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e ($1,757) is December 2001 and for\nthe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.h ($3,561) is March 2002. Under State statute of limitations law, the\ncreditor is barred from collecting these debts. These debts are listed on the August 12,\n2008 credit report, but they are not listed on the May 20, 2009 and the October 26, 2009\ncredit reports. The debts may have been removed from the credit reports because of\nage as Applicant admitted that these debts are his and that he has not paid these\ndebts.7\nAt the hearing Applicant indicated that he contacted the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.h\n($3,561) to develop a payment plan, but could not reach an agreement. He did not give\na date for this contact. He advised the OPM investigator that he had not contacted this\ncreditor to resolve the debt.8\nThe debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a ($274), 1.b ($242), and 1.g ($435) occurred between\nJanuary 2005 and December 2006. Under State statute of limitations law, the creditor is\nbarred from collecting these debts. The debts are listed on all the credit reports of\n\nResponse to the SOR; GE 4- GE 6; AE A; Tr. 20-22, 24.\n9\nGE 2; GE 4-GE 6.\n10\nGE 3; AE C; AE D; Tr. 31.\n11\nGE 2; Tr. 25, 31.\n12\n4\nrecord. Applicant admitted that these debts are his and that he has not paid these\ndebts. Applicant paid the $83 debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f.9\nThe credit reports reflect that Applicant is current on his monthly bills, his car\npayment, and his mortgage, and that he has been for several years. Applicant\nacknowledged that he did not contact the creditors listed in the SOR when he was in the\nUnited States because it took too much time. During his interview with the OPM\ninvestigator in December 2008, he indicated that he was saving approximately $6,000 a\nmonth. The credit reports show that he obtained a mortgage in December 2009.10\nWhen overseas, Applicant earns $10,615 a month in gross income and $8,956 a\nmonth in net income. His gross income and net income for the first pay period in\nSeptember 2010 declined by $1,700 when he traveled to the United States in late\nAugust 2010. His wife earns $2,713 a month in gross income and $2,196 a month in net\nincome. His total net household income when he is overseas $11,152 a month, and\nwhen he is in the United States, his net household income totals approximately $7,700.\nHis monthly expenses average $5,500 to $6,000. He has sufficient income each month\nto resolve his unpaid debts.11\nApplicant has not had financial counseling. When asked why he has not resolved\nhis debts, he answered that it was time-consuming to do. He also stated that if he did\nnot do it, it did not get done.12\nWhen he completed his e-QIP on August 2, 2008, Applicant answered \u201cno\u201d to the\nfollowing questions:\nSection 27. Your Financial Record\na.  In the last 7 years, have you had your wages garnished\nor had any property repossessed for any reason?\nd. In the last 7 years, have you had any judgments against\nyou that have not been paid?\nSection 28. Your Financial Delinquencies\na. In the last 7 years, have you been over 180 days\ndelinquent on any debt(s)?\n\nThe SOR stated question b in Section 28 as \u201cIn the last 7 years, have you been over 90 days delinquent on\n13\nany debt(s)?\u201d The security clearance application question asks if an Applicant is currently over 90 days\ndelinquent on any debt(s)? This is the question Applicant answered and the question to be addressed in this\ndecision.\nTr. 25-27.\n14\n5\nb. Are you currently over 90 days delinquent on any\ndebt(s)?13\nBecause his car was repossessed in 2000, he thought the question asked for 7\nyears, and it was 2008, Applicant stated he answered \u201cno\u201d question a in Section 27. He\ndid not list the repossession of his wife\u2019s car because it was paid. He did not know\nabout the judgments until the OPM investigator talked to him about these debts.\nConcerning his answers to the questions in Section 28, Applicant indicated that he was\noverseas and did not have access to a credit report. Thus, he answered \u201cno\u201d to these\nquestions. 14\nApplicant\u2019s testimony at the hearing and his statements to the OPM investigator\nreflect that he does not remember dates accurately. He does not have a clear\nunderstanding of the actions he took with each creditor, only an understanding that he\nmade contact with one of his creditors.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief\nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially\ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record.\n\n6\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d An\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion for obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nAG \u00b6 19 describes the disqualifying conditions that could raise security concerns.\nI have considered all the conditions, and especially the following:\n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant developed significant financial problems about 10 years ago when his\nwife lost her job. His income was insufficient to pay all the household bills. These two\ndisqualifying conditions apply.\n\n7\nThe Financial Considerations guideline also includes examples of conditions that\ncan mitigate security concerns. I have considered mitigating factors AG \u00b6 20(a) through\n20(f), and especially the following:\n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment;\n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control; and\n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.\nThe largest of Applicant\u2019s debt listed in the SOR occurred 8 to 10 years ago\nwhen his wife lost her job and his income was insufficient to pay all the household bills.\nHowever, her job loss does not explain the reason for the nonpayment of the other\ndebts, which occurred later. He has not received financial counseling. Except for two\ndebts, SOR \u00b6\u00b61.d and 1.f, he has not resolved the remaining debts listed in the SOR.\nAG \u00b6 20(c) applies to the judgment debt listed in SOR \u00b6 1.d, and to the debt listed in\nSOR \u00b6 1.f as the evidence of record reflects that he paid these debts.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and in this case,\nthe following condition may be disqualifying:\n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from\nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or\nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\n\nSee ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov.17, 2004)(explaining the holding in ISCR Case No. 02-\n15\n23133 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004)).\n8\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.\nFor AG DC \u00b6 16(a) to apply, Applicant\u2019s omission, concealment or falsification in\nhis answer must be deliberate. The Government established that Applicant omitted\nmaterial facts from his e-QIP when he answered \u201cno\u201d to Questions b and d in Section\n27, which asked if in the last 7 years: \u201c. . .  have you had your wages garnished or had\nany property repossessed for any reason?\u201d and \u201c. . . have you had any judgments\nagainst you that have not been paid?\u201d He did not disclose the repossessions of his car\nin 2000 and his wife\u2019s car in 2005. The Government also established that he omitted\nmaterial facts when he answered \u201cno\u201d to Questions a and b in Section 28, which asked\nabout debts more than 180 days delinquent and current debts 90 days delinquent. This\ninformation is material to the evaluation of Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness to hold a security\nclearance and to his honesty. In his response to the SOR and at the hearing, Applicant\ndenied, however, that he had an intent to hide information about his finances from the\nGovernment. When a falsification allegation is controverted, the Government has the\nburden of proving the omission was deliberate. Proof of an omission, standing alone,\ndoes not establish or prove an applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the omission\noccurred. An administrative judge must consider the record evidence as a whole to\ndetermine whether there is direct or circumstantial evidence concerning an applicant\u2019s\nintent or state of mind at the time the omission occurred.15\nApplicant completed his e-QIP in August 2008. His car was repossessed in 2000,\nmore than 7 years before he completed the e-QIP. Applicant did not list his wife\u2019s\nrepossessed car because the debt had been paid. While he should have listed this\nrepossession, his reasoning that it was paid, and as such, he did not have to list the\nrepossession does not show a deliberate intent to hide the information from the\ngovernment, but rather a misunderstanding of what is required in his response.\nApplicant was not aware of either judgment against him when he completed his e-QIP,\nalthough he was aware that his wife had paid on her car repossession through\ngarnishment. Thus, the requisite intent is not established. \nSince he began his current employment, he has made sufficient income to pay\nhis monthly bills and he has. Thus, his \u201cno\u201d answer to Question b in Section 28 was not\nan attempt to hide current delinquencies from the Government. Concerning the question\non debts more than 180 days overdue, Applicant did not have his credit report to\ndetermine if any such debts exist. He had been working overseas for many months and\nwas without ready access to his credit reports. During his lengthy stay overseas, his\nwife assumed responsibility for payment of  household bills and did not advised him of\nproblems. Without his credit report, he could not determine the status of his debts. He\ndid not intentionally deceive the Government about his very old debts. The Government\nhas not established that Applicant intentionally falsified his answers on his e-QIP.\nGuideline E is found in favor of Applicant.\n\n9\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. The decision to grant or\ndeny a security clearance requires a careful weighing of all relevant factors, both\nfavorable and unfavorable. In so doing, an administrative judge must review all the\nevidence of record, not a single item in isolation, to determine if a security concern is\nestablished and then whether it is mitigated. A determination of an applicant\u2019s eligibility\nfor a security clearance should not be made as punishment for specific past conduct,\nbut on a reasonable and careful evaluation of all the evidence of record to decide if a\nnexus exists between established facts and a legitimate security concern. \nIn assessing whether an Applicant has established mitigation under Guideline F,\nthe Appeal Board provided the following guidance in ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 3\n(App. Bd. May 21, 2008):\nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the\nconcept of \u201c\u2018meaningful track record\u2019 necessarily includes evidence of\nactual debt reduction through payment of debts.\u201d See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 05-01920 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 1, 200). However, an applicant is not\nrequired, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each and\nevery debt listed in the SOR. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-25499 at 2\n(App. Bd. Jun. 5, 2006). All that is required is that an applicant\ndemonstrate that he has \u201c. . . established a plan to resolve his financial\nproblems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 04-09684 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 6, 2006). The Judge can\nreasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial situation and\nhis actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant\u2019s plan for the\nreduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See\nDirective \u00b6 E2.2(a) (\u201cAvailable, reliable information about the person, past\nand present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching\n\n10\na determination.\u201d) There is no requirement that a plan provide for\npayments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable\nplan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such\ndebts one at a time. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-25584 at 4 (App. Bd.\nApr. 4, 2008). Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts actually\npaid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in the\nSOR.\nIn reaching a conclusion, I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s\nfinancial problems first began when his wife lost her job in 2000. When he stopped his\nmonthly payments, his car was repossessed. He filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy in an\neffort to gain control of his finances, but could not afford the monthly payment required\nby the court.  His finances have improved in recent years, but he has not made an effort\nto pay three of the four small debts listed in the SOR, even though he acknowledges\nthat these debts are his and he earns more than $8,000 a month.\nOther than the two judgments, the unpaid debts listed in the SOR are barred\nfrom collection under state law because the unpaid debts are between four and ten\nyears old. However, the Appeal Board has held that the elimination of a debt under a\nstatute of limitations does not show a good faith resolution of a debt, a holding with\nwhich I have always agreed. In the instant case, Applicant\u2019s current monthly finances\nare timely paid. He has not paid three small debts listed in the SOR, which he can easily\nafford to pay.  Applicant has not taken any action on the $20,000 judgment, which is still\na viable debt. As of the hearing, he had no plans to try and resolve the debt. Because\nhe has not taken any action on this debt or his other unpaid debts, and he has the\nfinancial resources to resolve some of these debts, I find that he has not resolved the\nGovernment\u2019s security concerns about his finances.\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s\neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude\nApplicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his personal conduct under\nGuideline E, but he has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his finances\nunder Guideline F.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\n\n11\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Accordingly, her request for a security clearance is granted. \n \nApplicant submitted a Questionnaire for Sensitive Positions, which she signed on \nJune 26, 2008. After reviewing the results of the ensuing background investigation, \nadjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) were unable to \nmake a preliminary affirmative finding1 that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant\u2019s request.  \n \n \nOn October 22, 2009, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \nthat specified the basis for its decision: security concerns addressed in the Directive \n \n1 Required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and by DoD Directive 5220.6 (Directive), as \namended. \nFebruary 25, 2010\n\n \n \n2\n                                                \nunder Guideline B (Foreign Influence) and Guideline C (Foreign Preference) of the \nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG).2 Applicant signed her notarized Answer \nNovember 24, 2009, in which she admitted all the allegations in the Statement of \nReasons. She also requested a hearing before an administrative judge. \n \nDepartment Counsel was prepared to proceed on December 7, 2009, and the \ncase was assigned to me on December 16, 2009. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on \nJanuary 14, 2010, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on February 3, 2010. \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered two exhibits, which were marked as \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1 and 2, and admitted without objection. Applicant testified \nand did not offer exhibits. I held the record open to allow Applicant to submit additional \ndocumentation, which was timely received and forwarded without objection by \nDepartment Counsel. Applicant's submissions are admitted as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A \nand B. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on February 16, 2010. \n \nProcedural Rulings \n \n \nPrior to the hearing, by memorandum dated December 7, 2009, the government \nmoved to amend the SOR as follows:  \n \n \n \nGuideline B: The government withdrew the entire paragraph. \n \n \n \nGuideline C: The government transferred allegation 2.a. from Guideline B \nto Guideline C. The transferred allegation becomes subparagraph 1.e. under Guideline \nC, reading as follows: \n \n \n \n1.e. You have traveled to Venezuela between February 2005 and  \n \n \nJanuary 2008 using your Venezuelan passport to travel. \n \nThe SOR is so amended. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated herein as \nfindings of fact. After a thorough review of the pleadings, Applicant\u2019s response to the \nSOR, and the record evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. \n \nApplicant, 24 years old, was born in Venezuela and moved to the United States \nwhen she was six years old. Her parents currently live in the United States and are U.S. \ncitizens. Applicant is single and has no children. Applicant was educated in the United \n \n2 Adjudication of this case is controlled by the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, approved by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005. The Revised Adjudicative Guidelines supersede the guidelines listed \nin Enclosure 2 to the Directive, and they apply to all adjudications or trustworthiness determinations in \nwhich an SOR was issued on or after September 1, 2006. \n\n \n \n3\nStates and completed a bachelor\u2019s degree in business administration in 2007. She \nbegan working for a defense contractor after graduation, where she is currently a senior \nconsultant. This is her first security clearance application. (GE 1; Tr. 14, 20-23)  \n \nApplicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen in August 2005, and received her \nU.S. passport in September 2005. As of the date of the hearing, she also held a valid \nVenezuelan passport, which was issued in September 2007 and will expire in \nSeptember 2012. Applicant indicated in her response to the May 2009 DOHA \ninterrogatory that she was willing to surrender, destroy or invalidate her Venezuelan \npassport. By letter dated May 21, 2009, Applicant's Lead Personnel Security Officer \nforwarded a letter to DOHA confirming that Applicant surrendered her Venezuelan \npassport, and that it is in the possession of the security office. Applicant signed a \nmemorandum stating that any request for the return of her passport will be reported to \nthe government. (GE 1, 2; AE A, B; Tr. 24-25) \n \n \nApplicant's grandmother, who lived in Venezuela, became ill in 2007. Applicant \nand her parents decided to visit her and Applicant renewed her Venezuelan passport. \nVisiting her ailing grandmother was \u201cthe sole reason that my passport was renewed. It \nwas not because I had any loyalties to the country, just to my grandmother, who has \nsince passed away in 2008.\u201d Applicant and her parents, believing at the time that the \nVenezuelan government required native-born Venezuelan citizens to enter and exit \nVenezuela using Venezuelan passports, traveled to Venezuela in December 2007 \nusing their Venezuelan passports. Applicant\u2019s foreign passport shows a single set of \nstamps, indicating entry and exit from Venezuela in 2007. Applicant did not realize her \nforeign passport represented a security concern until her security interview in August \n2008. (GE 1, 2; AE A, B; Tr. 17-18, 42)  \n \nApplicant traveled extensively between 2001 and 2009. After she obtained her \nU.S. citizenship in 2005, she traveled to France, Portugal, and Italy, while studying \nabroad in Spain in 2006. After completing her security clearance application, she \ntraveled to Venezuela in September 2008 for her grandmother\u2019s funeral, and again in \nJuly 2009. She used her U.S. passport for all of these trips. Her U.S. passport shows \nlegible foreign stamps for entry and/or exit from Germany in 2006; Venezuela in \nSeptember 2008 and July 2009; and a student visa for Spain in 2006. Applicant \ntestified that she travels to Venezuela only with her parents and, \u201cBecause I have \nmoved to the States and this is all I've known, anytime that I go back to Venezuela if \nI'm not with my parents, it means nothing almost. They're my, you know, only \nconnection essentially, and their loyalties are also here.\u201d (GE 1, 2; AE B; Tr. 27-28, 32-\n33, 40) \n \n \nApplicant voted in a Venezuelan presidential election in 2007, and in two \nconstitutional referenda in 2006 and 2008. She testified at hearing that she did so \nbecause, \u201cI just felt\u2014that I disagree with the policies that are being instituted down \nthere and it was really more of a symbolic thing.\u201d Applicant was unaware at the time \nshe voted in Venezuelan elections that it represented a security concern. (Tr. 52-53) \n\n \n \n4\n                                                \nShe has no intent to vote in future Venezuelan elections. Applicant is a registered U.S. \nvoter and has voted in U.S. elections. She has no financial interests in Venezuela. She \ndoes not receive benefits from the Venezuelan government, and does not own property \nthere. Applicant is willing to renounce her Venezuelan citizenship (GE 2; Tr. 18-19, 37, \n44-45, 53) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and common-sense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the revised AG.3 \nDecisions must also reflect consideration of the \u201cwhole person\u201d factors listed in \u00b6 2(a) of \nthe Guidelines. \n \n \nThe presence or absence of disqualifying or mitigating conditions does not \ndetermine a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed when a case can be so measured, as they represent \npolicy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified information.  \n \n \nA security clearance decision is intended only to resolve the question of whether \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest4 for an applicant to receive or continue \nto have access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of \nproducing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision to deny or \nrevoke a security clearance. Additionally, the government must be able to prove \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it falls to \napplicants to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case. Because no one has \na \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, applicants bear a heavy burden of persuasion.5 A \nperson who has access to classified information enters a fiduciary relationship based on \ntrust and confidence. The government has a compelling interest in ensuring that \napplicants possess the requisite judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness to protect the \nnational interest as his or her own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d \nstandard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for \naccess to classified information in favor of the government.6 \n \n \n \n \n3 Directive. 6.3. \n4 See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988). \n5 See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531. \n6 See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).  \n \n\n \n \n5\nAnalysis \n \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference \n \n \nThe security concern involving foreign preference arises  \n \n[W]hen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a \nforeign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to \nprovide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of \nthe United States. (AG \u00b6 9) \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 10, the following disqualifying condition is relevant: \n \n(a) exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after \nbecoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family \nmember.  This includes but is not limited to: (1) possession of a current \nforeign passport;\u2026 (7) voting in a foreign election\u2026. \n \nApplicant\u2019s possession of a Venezuelan passport before she became a U.S. citizen in \n2005 is not disqualifying under the security clearance guidelines. However, conduct \nthat constitutes an exercise of foreign citizenship can be disqualifying if it occurs after \nan applicant becomes a U.S. citizen. Applicant exercised the rights of a Venezuelan \ncitizen by possessing a valid foreign passport after becoming a U.S. citizen in 2005, \nand by voting in a Venezuelan presidential election and in two constitutional referenda. \nHer actions occurred after she became a U.S. citizen and represent an exercise of \nforeign citizenship rights. AG \u00b6\u00b6 10(a)(1) and 10(a)(7) apply. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 11, I considered the six mitigating conditions, and especially the \nfollowing: \n \n(b) the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship; and \n \n(e) the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant \nsecurity authority, or otherwise invalidated. \n \nApplicant traveled to Venezuela three times since she became a U.S. citizen in \n2005. When her grandmother became ill in 2007, she traveled to see her and used her \nforeign passport to enter and exit Venezuela because she mistakenly believed that she \nwas required to do so. On both subsequent trips to Venezuela, and on all her other \nforeign travel since 2005, she used only her U.S. passport. Her use of her U.S. \npassport in all subsequent trips supports her claim that she used the foreign passport \nthrough error rather than because of a wish to hold herself out as a Venezuelan rather \nthan a U.S. citizen. In addition, Applicant stated during her security interview, in her \ninterrogatory response, and at the hearing that she is willing to renounce her foreign \ncitizenship. AG \u00b6 11(b) applies. \n\n \n \n6\n \n \nApplicant learned from the May 2009 DOHA interrogatory how to resolve the \nsecurity concern about her foreign passport. Applicant provided evidence that on May \n21, 2009, she surrendered her Venezuelan passport to her security officer. She signed \na memorandum acknowledging that if she requests its return, her employer will notify \nthe government. AG \u00b6 11(e) applies.  \n \nWhole Person Analysis   \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate the \nApplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s conduct and \nall the relevant circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nAG \u00b6 2(c) requires that the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security \nclearance must be an overall common-sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. Under the cited \nguideline, I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nall the facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  \n \n \nIn cases where a dual citizen holds a foreign passport or exercises other rights \nof foreign citizenship, and also wishes to be granted a security clearance, a security \nconcern arises and further inquiry is required. The concern can be mitigated if the \nforeign passport is destroyed, invalidated or surrendered to a cognizant security \nauthority. Here, Applicant\u2018s possession and use of a foreign passport and her voting in \nforeign elections, raised security concerns. However, she credibly testified that her \nvoting was a symbolic gesture to underscore her disagreement with the policies of the \nforeign government. She was unaware that her action would have any security \nsignificance. Moreover, she is a registered U.S. voter, and has voted in U.S. elections.  \n \n \n \nAs to her use of a foreign passport to travel in 2007, it resulted from a \ncombination of factors: the need to visit her ailing grandmother in Venezuela, and a \nmistaken belief that she was required to use her foreign passport. Her claim of mistake \nis supported by the evidence that she used the foreign passport only once, and that \nwhen she learned that she could travel to Venezuela on her U.S. passport, she used it \non every subsequent visit to Venezuela, and in all her other foreign travels. The \n\n \n \n7\nrelevant guideline also calls for valid foreign passports to be surrendered, destroyed or \ninvalidated. Applicant took the necessary steps and has surrendered her passport to \nthe cognizant security authority, as required.  \n \n \nOverall, the record evidence satisfies the doubts raised about Applicant\u2019s \nsuitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has \nmitigated the security concerns arising from the cited adjudicative guideline. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline C  \n \nFOR Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a. - 1.e. \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline B  \n \nWITHDRAWN \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to allow Applicant access to \nclassified information.

Based\nupon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nDepartment Counsel sent an amended SOR to Applicant on December 8, 2009,\nwhich added to Guideline F, SOR \u00b6 1.g: \u201cYou failed to pay your child support obligation\nand as of October 2, 2008 had owed approximately $1,611.54 in back child support.\nYour wages are currently being garnished at a rate of $15.00 every week to pay back\nthis child support obligation.\u201d\nIn addition, the Government amended Guideline E, SOR \u00b6 2 by adding allegation\n2.b: \nYou falsified material facts on an Electronic Questionnaire for\nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP), certified by you on or about October\n15, 2008, in response to \u201cSection 28. Your Financial Delinquencies   a. In\nthe last 7 years, have you been over 180 days delinquent on any debt(s)?;\n[and] b. Are you currently over 90 days delinquent on any debt(s)? \u201cYou\nanswered \u201cno\u201d to both of those questions; whereas in truth, you\ndeliberately failed to disclose that your child support obligation was at least\n90 days delinquent as of the date you signed your e-QIP.\nThe amendments were admitted into the record without objection.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a\nthrough 1.f. He denied the factual allegation in \u00b6 2.a. In his answer to the amended\nSOR, Applicant admitted the allegations in \u00b6 1.g and \u00b6 2.b, as amended. \nApplicant is a 43-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He graduated from\nhigh school in 1984, and attended a technical school in 1991-1992 (GE 1). He is single\nand has four children. He has been with his current employer since May 2008 (Tr. 18).\nPrior to Applicant\u2019s current employment, he worked on a temporary basis for a\nnumber of companies (Tr. 19). He was unemployed for a few months in 2007 and for a\nfew months in 2006 (Tr. 20). He also recalls that he was unemployed from September\n2004 until March 2005. He has never held a security clearance (Tr. 21).\nThe SOR alleges seven delinquent debts, including a child support obligation,\nstudent loan, and collection accounts. The approximate total for Applicant\u2019s debts is\n$25,000 (GE 3). The current status of Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts is described below.\n\n3\nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a is for a collection account in the amount of $454.\nApplicant co-signed a contract so that his cousin could have a phone account. She has\nnot paid the bill. At this time, the account is unpaid.\nApplicant admits the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b for $178. He sent one payment of\n$25 in 2008 or 2009. The account remains unpaid (Tr.32).  \nApplicant admits the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c. for $21,349. The account is for\nhis student loan from 1991 (GE 3). He had been paying $125 a month for about 10 or\n11 months in 2007 (Tr. 34). He has not made any payments since 2007 (Tr. 34).\nApplicant admits the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d for $131. This cell phone account\nis unpaid. \nApplicant admits the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e for $691. He contracted for Direct\nTV service in 2007. He has not returned the cable box and has not paid the account (Tr.\n36).\nApplicant admits the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f for $527. His cell phone company\nincreased his monthly fees, and he could not afford to pay. He terminated the contract,\nbut he was charged a fee (Tr. 38). This account is unpaid. \nApplicant admits the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g for a child support arrearage of\n$1,611.54. His arrearage is due to unemployment in 2008 (Tr. 48). Applicant\u2019s wages\nare garnished. He pays $60 a month. His current balance is $61.21 (AE A).\nApplicant\u2019s net monthly income is approximately $2,292 (GE 2). He is current\nwith his monthly expenses. He has no car payment. His net monthly remainder is\napproximately $200. He has no savings account. Applicant has no credit cards (Tr. 57).\nHe has not obtained any financial counseling.\nWhen Applicant completed his October 2008 security clearance application, he\nread section 28(a) and 28(b) concerning any financial delinquencies. In that application,\nhe answered \u201cNo\u201d to question 28(a) concerning debts over 180 days delinquent in the\nlast seven years, and \u201cNo\u201d to question 28(b) concerning debts over 90 days delinquent\n(GE 1). Applicant denied any deliberate intent to mislead the government. He\napologized for answering the questions wrong. He was not focusing on the old debts,\nbut thought about items such as a mortgage or car loan (Tr. 45). He did not intentionally\nomit the child support garnishment because it appeared as an automatic deduction on\nhis pay. He never received records of any court proceedings. I found his testimony\ncredible. He now realizes that he should have answered sections 28(a) and 28(b) in the\naffirmative (Tr. 73). \n\n4\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which must be considered\nin evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2,\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin\nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty\nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple\nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).\n \n \n\n5\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated delinquent debts on many accounts by his\nown admission. His credit reports confirm the debts. The evidence is sufficient to raise\nthese disqualifying conditions.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant still\nhas significant unresolved delinquent debts. He is not in a stable financial situation.\nThere is a likelihood that future debt will occur. This mitigating condition does not apply. \nUnder AG & 20(b), the disqualifying condition may be mitigated where Athe\nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s\ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical\nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly\nunder the circumstances.@ Applicant has had several periods of unemployment. When\nhe lost his jobs and could not find work, he incurred delinquent debts. In 2008, when he\nfound employment, he was receiving a steady salary. At that point, he did not pay his\ndelinquent debts or arrange for a repayment plan. He did make one payment after\nreceiving the SOR. He is disputing the phone account that he co-signed for his cousin,\nbut Applicant is ultimately responsible for the account. Applicant has not acted\nresponsibly in paying his accounts under the circumstances.  This mitigating condition\napplies in part.\nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the\nevidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\n\n6\notherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant has not received formal financial counseling. He has\nnot resolved the majority of his delinquent debts. He disputed one amount but he is not\nactively working on resolving the issue. He has reduced his child support arrearage\nthrough garnishment. His efforts are insufficient to carry his burden in this case. I\nconclude these mitigating conditions do not apply.\nAG \u00b6 20(e) applies where the evidence shows \u201cthe individual has a reasonable\nbasis to dispute the legitimacy of the past due debt which is the cause of the problem\nand provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.\u201d Although he has disputed responsibility for\none debt, his basis for refusing to pay is not reasonable. This mitigating condition does\nnot apply.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in\nAG \u00b6 15:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to cooperate with\nthe security clearance process.\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG \u00b6 16(a), \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any\npersonnel questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct\ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities\u201d is potentially disqualifying.\nIn this case, when Applicant completed his October 2008 security application, he\ndid not answer \u201cyes\u201d to section 28(a) or 28(b). He denied the allegation concerning a\nfalsification of his answer to delinquent debts. He admitted that he did not report the\nchild support arrearage that was being deducted automatically from his pay check. At\nthe hearing, he stated that he \u201cmessed up the questions\u201d but was not focusing on them.\nHe incorrectly answered the questions but he did not intentionally falsify his application. \nWhen a falsification allegation is controverted or denied, the government has the\nburden of proving it. Proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove\nan applicant\u2019s state of mind when the omission occurred. An administrative judge must\nconsider the record evidence as whole to determine whether there is direct or\ncircumstantial evidence concerning an applicant\u2019s state of mind at the time the omission\noccurred. ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004) (explaining holding in\nISCR Case No. 02-23133 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004)). Thus, AG \u00b6 16(a) does not\napply in this case. I find for Applicant on SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b.\n\n7\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case and conclude they are insufficient to\novercome the government\u2019s case. Applicant has worked all his life. He attempted to get\na better job by attending the technical institute after high school. He has four children.\nHe supports them as a single parent. He has experienced unemployment on various\noccasions. He is a hard worker. He intends to pay his bills when he is financially stable.\nHowever, he has not acted responsibly under the circumstances. When he obtained\nsteady employment, he did not address his delinquent debts. He has no repayment plan\nbeyond a generalized intent to pay his creditors. He has not mitigated the security\nconcerns under the financial considerations guideline. He answered questions 28(a)\nand 28(b) concerning delinquent debts in the last 7 years to the best of his ability. He\ndid not intentionally fail to disclose reportable delinquent debts on his SF 86. He has\nmitigated the personal conduct concerns.\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising under financial\nconsiderations. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\n\n8\nSubparagraphs 1.a: through 1.g: Against Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \n_________________\nNOREEN A. LYNCH\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Howry, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\nDecember 15, 2010\n______________\nDECISION\n______________\nROSS, Wilford H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP), on October 7, 2007. (Government Exhibit 6.) On June 24, 2009, the Defense\nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons\n(SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The\naction was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information\nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive\n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2,\n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant submitted Answers to the SOR on August 31, September 28, and\nOctober 19, 2009, and requested that a decision be made without a hearing.\n(Government Exhibits 3, 4 and 5.) Department Counsel submitted a File of Relevant\nMaterial (FORM) to Applicant on December 14, 2009. Applicant received the FORM on\nFebruary 8, 2010, and was given 30 days to submit any additional information. The\ncase was assigned to me on April 6, 2010. On April 19, 2010, and again on October 14,\n\nApplicant alleges that his ex-wife engaged in other actions to affect his financial stability. (Item 8 at 9.)\n1\n2\n2010, Applicant requested additional time to submit supplementary documentary\ninformation due to his being deployed overseas in support of current military operations.\nThose requests were granted, and the Applicant was given until November 19, 2010, to\nsubmit any additional documentation. Applicant did not submit any additional\ninformation. Based upon a review of the written record eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is 48, and married to his second wife. He is employed by a defense\ncontractor and seeks to obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment. \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe Government alleges that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he is\nfinancially overextended and therefore at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to\ngenerate funds.  Applicant admits all of the allegations in the SOR. Those admissions\nare hereby deemed findings of fact. He also submitted additional statements supporting\nhis request for a security clearance.\nThe SOR alleges, Applicant admits, and Government exhibits substantiate, 8\ndelinquent debts totaling $59,215. Some of these debts have been due and owing since\nat least 2007. (Government Exhibits 7, 9, 10 and 11.) \n1.a. Applicant admits filing for Chapter 13 Bankruptcy in June 2005. The case\nwas dismissed in September 2005. He states in his Answer that the case was\n\u201cdismissed due to my ex-wife . . . removing the funds from my account. I had not been\nable to separate our finances and she had access to my funds. She has continued to\nattempt to hurt me financially.\u201d  (Government Exhibit 4.)\n1\n1.b. Applicant admits that he was indebted to a collection agent for a credit union\nin the amount of $24,242. He further claims that this debt is the same debt as 1.d.\nApplicant stated in his Answer that he was working with the collection agent to resolve\nthis account, but no further information was received. This debt is due and owing.\n1.c. Applicant admits that he was indebted to a collection agent for a credit union\nin the amount of $2,925. He submitted evidence showing he paid this account in July\n2009. (Government Exhibit 3 at 10.) This debt is resolved.\n1.d. Applicant admits that he was indebted to a credit union on a charged off\naccount in the amount of $19,000. He submits that this is the same debt as the one set\nforth in 1.a.  The available credit reports show both debts as being due and owing.\n(Government Exhibits 7, 9, 10 and 11.) Applicant has not supplied any documentation\n\nApplicant submitted a copy of a letter from a collection agent for this bank concerning a $340 payment in July\n2\n2009. (Government Exhibit 3 at 9.) The account number on the letter does not correspond with any of the\nApplicant\u2019s accounts with this bank, as shown on the available evidence. The payment does not correspond\nto the Applicant\u2019s statements about his accounts with this bank. Accordingly, I can give the fact of this payment\nlittle weight.\n3\nsupporting his statement that these are the same debts. Based on the available\nevidence, I find that this is a different debt, and continues to be due and owing.\n1.e. Applicant admits owing a collection agent $74 for a past due account. He\nstated in his Answers that he had paid this account in April 2009. Applicant further\nstated, \u201cI have been trying to get this updated on credit agency report.\u201d (Government\nExhibit 4.) This debt is not listed on the most recent credit report in the file, dating from\nDecember 2009. (Government Exhibit 11.) Based on the available information, I find\nthat this debt is resolved.\n1.f. Applicant admits that he was indebted to a collection agent for a bank in the\namount of $1,691. He submitted evidence showing he paid this account in July 2009.\n(Government Exhibit 3 at 8.) This debt is resolved.\n1.g. Applicant admits that he was indebted to a bank in the amount of $1,028. He\nstates that he paid this account in 2006. Applicant submitted no evidence to support this\nstatement. The available credit reports show that this account was \u201ctransferred or sold,\u201d\nbut do not report it as paid. (Government Exhibits 7, 9, 10 and 11.) This debt is\nunresolved.\n1.h. Applicant admits that he was indebted to a bank in the amount of $2,801. He\nstates that he was contacting this creditor to confirm the accuracy of the debt. (Applicant\nExhibit 4.) He submitted no evidence to support this statement. The available credit\nreports show that this account was \u201ctransferred or sold,\u201d but do not report it as paid.\n(Government Exhibits 7, 9, 10 and 11.) This debt is unresolved.2\n1.i. Applicant admits that he was indebted to a state university in the amount of\n$7,454. This debt occurred because the Applicant withdrew late from his classes at the\nuniversity and still owed his tuition. Applicant states that he was forced to withdraw from\nclass because of his then ongoing divorce from his first wife. He submitted an appeal in\nJuly 2009 to the university authorities to have the debt forgiven. (Government Exhibit 3\nat 11-13.) No further information was submitted concerning the current status of this\nappeal. This debt is unresolved.\n \nPolicies\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  When evaluating an\napplicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the administrative judge must consider\nthe adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for each\nguideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and\n\n4\nmitigating conditions, which are to be used as appropriate in evaluating an applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c),\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.  In addition, the administrative judge may also rely on his or her own common\nsense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature, and the ways of the world, in\nmaking a reasoned decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Security clearance decisions include, by\nnecessity, consideration of the possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a\ncertain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk\nof compromise of classified information.\n \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny\ndetermination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the national\ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant\nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access\nto classified or sensitive information).  \n\n5\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and\nmeet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment,\nor unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant, by his own admission, has over $59,000 in past due debts,\nall of which have been due and owing for several years. The evidence is sufficient to\nraise these potentially disqualifying conditions.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s\nfinancial difficulties arose recently, starting about 2007, and continue to the present. In\naddition, while Applicant has shown that several debts have been paid (1.c., 1.e., 1.f.),\nhe failed to provide any evidence concerning paying off the rest of his debts. It is\nApplicant\u2019s burden to submit evidence showing that his financial situation has improved.\nHe has not done so.  This mitigating condition is not applicable to this case.  \nAG \u00b6 20(b) states that the disqualifying conditions may be mitigated where \u201cthe\nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s\ncontrol (e.g.,. . . divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the\ncircumstances.\u201d  Applicant submits that his conflict with his first wife effected his ability\nto pay his debts. However, their divorce was in 2005, and Applicant did not show how it\nhas had a continuing impact on his ability to pay his debts. He did not provide any\ninformation concerning what he has been doing about his debts in the past year, despite\nbeing given a substantial amount of time to do so.\nApplicant has not initiated a good-faith effort to pay off his creditors.  There is no\ntrack record of his making payments for a consistent period of time.  Accordingly, AG \u00b6\n20(d) is not applicable.  Finally, given the fact that he is still $54,000 in debt, I cannot\n\nAssuming that allegations 1.b. and 1.d. are the same debt, he remains over $30,000 in debt. As stated, he\n3\nhas provided insufficient information about how he is going to resolve his indebtedness.\n6\nfind that \u201cthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under\ncontrol,\u201d as required by AG \u00b6 20(c).3\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the relevant circumstances. Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination\nof whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense\njudgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person\nconcept. The administrative judge must consider the nine adjudicative process factors\nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.      \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is under financial strain,\nand has been so for several years. His debt situation is not yet under control. Under AG\n\u00b6 2(a)(3), Applicant\u2019s conduct is recent.  Based on the state of the record, I cannot find\nthat there have been permanent behavioral changes under AG \u00b6 2(a)(6). Accordingly, at\nthe present time, I find that there is the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress (AG \u00b6 2(a)(8)); and that there is a high likelihood of recurrence (AG \u00b6 2(a)(9)). \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial\nsituation.\nOn balance, I conclude that Applicant has not successfully overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing his request for a DoD security clearance.  Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a denial of his request for a security clearance.\n\n7\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i.:\nAgainst the Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Howry, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: David I. West, Esquire\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nWHITE, David M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant bought a home in 2004 after retiring from the Navy. He was laid off\neight months later, through no fault of his. He had to relocate to find work, and was\nunable to either sell or rent the home due to the depressed real estate market. His first\nmortgage debt was fully resolved by foreclosure, he repaid the second loan, and had no\nother delinquent debts. Based upon a thorough review of the case file, pleadings,\nexhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nApplicant submitted his security clearance application on September 29, 2008.\nOn July 24, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline F\n(Financial Considerations). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense (DoD) for SORs issued after September 1,\nMarch 31, 2010\n\n2\n2006. Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on August 5, 2009. He answered the\nSOR in writing (AR) on August 19, 2009, and requested a hearing before an\nadministrative judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on October 27,\n2009, and DOHA assigned the case to me on November 2, 2009.\nDOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on December 8, 2009, and I convened the\nhearing as scheduled on January 5, 2010. Department Counsel offered Government\nExhibits (GE) 1 through 7, which were admitted without objection. Applicant testified on\nhis own behalf, and offered Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through C, which were also\nadmitted without objection. Three additional witnesses testified on Applicant\u2019s behalf.\nDOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on January 13, 2010.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 52-year-old employee of a defense contractor, for whom he has\nworked since 2005. He retired in 2004 after serving for 20 years in the Navy, with an 8-\nyear break in service. He held a high-level security clearance throughout his naval\nservice without any adverse incidents. He is married with two children, ages 19 and 17.\nHis 17-year-old son has cerebral palsy, with the mental development of a 2-year-old,\nand recurrent serious respiratory problems. (GE 2 at 6, 12, 18-22, 26-27, 32-33; Tr. at\n52-53, 72-74.) In his answer to the SOR, Applicant denied the allegation set forth in \u00b6\n1.a, and admitted the allegation in \u00b6 1.b, with explanations. (AR at 1-2.) His admissions\nand explanations are incorporated into the following findings of fact.\nApplicant\u2019s last Navy duty station was in State One, close to where his family and\nhis wife\u2019s family reside. He lived in Navy housing there for 11 years, until his retirement\nfrom active duty. He was hired by a small local defense contractor and began working\nimmediately after leaving the service. He and his wife bought a home by taking out a\n$304,000 first mortgage loan and a $38,000 home equity line of credit. (GE 4 at 10, 15;\nGE 3 at 4; Tr. at 55-57, 74-75.)\nEight months later, Applicant\u2019s employer lost the contract under which he was\nworking and he was laid off. He unsuccessfully searched for another job in the area for\nseveral months. He was finally hired by another company to work in State Two, on the\nother coast. The area where he started working did not have adequate special\neducation programs to meet his son\u2019s needs, so his wife and children remained in their\nhome and he rented a room. He continued to work as a geographic bachelor, and after\nsix months he was hired directly by the major defense contractor for whom his State\nTwo employer performed subcontract work. About a year after he first moved to State\nTwo, his new employer transferred him to work in State Three. This was back on the\noriginal coast, and in an area with good special education programs. (GE 2 at 9-10, 12-\n15; Tr. at 57-59, 75-78.)\nApplicant and his wife listed their home for sale once he left State Two, and also\nattempted to rent it. They were unsuccessful in both efforts. After another year of living\napart, the family separation became too difficult to endure. Applicant\u2019s wife is unable to\n\n3\nwork outside their home due to their son\u2019s extensive needs for care and attention. He\ncontinued growing bigger and stronger, making it increasingly difficult for her to care for\nhim alone. In March 2007, Applicant\u2019s wife and children moved north to join him and\nthey rented a house to live in. (Tr. at 59-62, 78-81.) \nApplicant and his wife continued to try to sell their home, but the State One real\nestate market had become very bad and they were unsuccessful. They remained\ncurrent on their mortgage payments, and all other debts, throughout this time. From\nJune through August 2007, Applicant communicated the situation to the mortgage\nlender (the same company held both loans), and sought permission to pursue a \u201cshort\nsale\u201d since the market value had fallen to substantially less than the loan balances. The\nlender was also put on notice that Applicant\u2019s savings would only permit continued\npayments for several more months at the original rate, but no assistance was offered. In\nlate November 2007, still without success in either selling or renting the house,\nApplicant notified the lender in writing that he could no longer afford to make payments\ntoward the mortgage loans. Applicant promptly informed his supervisor and his\ncompany\u2019s security officer about the situation because he knew defaulting on his\nmortgage could raise security concerns. (GE 4 at 21-30; AE C; Tr. at 82-88.) \nDuring the winter and spring of 2008, Applicant and his wife actively worked with\ntheir real estate agency to try to sell the house. The agency communicated several\noffers to purchase the house in \u201cshort sales\u201d to the lender, but received no authority to\nproceed and each offer was eventually withdrawn. (GE 4 at 34-37.) Finally, the agency\nassigned a \u201cshort sale\u201d specialist to work with Applicant\u2019s property. In late July 2008, he\nreceived, and forwarded to the lender, a signed offer to purchase the property for\n$205,000. The agent attempted to work with the lender to obtain approval for the \u201cshort\nsale\u201d without success until September 2008. The lender, a large national financial\ninstitution with very high exposure due to a large portfolio of bad mortgage loans, was\ntaken over by another major financial institution around this time. Applicant received\ndemands for payment in full of his mortgage loans, and the creditor began foreclosure\nproceedings against the property. (GE 4 at 36-53, 57-58; AE B; Tr. at 81-82.) \n On September 29, 2008, Applicant\u2019s house was auctioned in a foreclosure sale.\nThe new creditor on his loans submitted the high bid, and bought the property from itself\nfor $149,000. (GE 4 at 54-55; Tr. at 28-30.) I took administrative notice of the section of\nState One law known as the Anti-deficiency Act. (See HE II; Tr. at 27-28.) This law\neliminates any remaining deficiency debt after a lien holder sells the collateral real\nproperty securing the loan. While it remains unresolved whether such a sale would\ncancel the debt represented by the second mortgage/home equity line of credit,\nDepartment Counsel agreed that it clearly applied to the first mortgage, and the sale of\nthe property fully resolved the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b. Applicant\u2019s two most recent\ncredit reports reflect a zero balance owed on this debt. (GE 3 at 4; GE 5 at 1; GE 6 at 2;\nTr. at 27-30, 114-117.)\nApplicant\u2019s creditor transferred his home equity loan/second mortgage debt to a\ncollection agency. Applicant consulted with an attorney concerning available options for\n\n4\nresolving this debt during early 2009. The attorney advised him that the debt could be\nfully discharged through a bankruptcy proceeding, but Applicant wanted to repay as\nmuch of this loan as he could rather than avoid it. From March through May 2009, he\nnegotiated with the collection agency. On April 28, 2009, they reached an agreement\nthat he could fully satisfy this debt through a one-time payment of $23,690. Applicant\ntook $5,490 from his savings account, obtained a $9,000 signature loan from his credit\nunion, and took a cash advance of $8,200 on a credit card to obtain the funds needed to\npay this debt. On May 23, 2009, Applicant\u2019s credit union paid the agreed amount to the\ncollection agency through wire transfer. (AR at 1-2, 6, 9-14; Tr. at 89-92.)\nApplicant submitted budget documents demonstrating that he and his wife are\nliving within their means, and can afford to make the payments on his credit card debt\nand signature loan while still maintaining a monthly income surplus of more than $500.\nApplicant has not incurred any delinquent debt other than the two loans discussed\nabove for the purchase of the home in California. He and his wife have no intention of\nbuying another home. (AR at 15-18; Tr. at 92-104.) \n \nApplicant\u2019s two supervisors testified to his excellent work performance,\ntrustworthiness, and reliability. They both have long experience working with classified\ninformation, and trust Applicant to safeguard such information and comply fully with\nsecurity procedures. (Tr. at 31-50.) Applicant\u2019s former pastor, who has known him well\nsince 1998, wrote a letter expressing his high opinion of Applicant\u2019s honesty,\nresponsibility, commitment and honor. (AE A.) Applicant\u2019s testimony and demeanor\nduring the hearing reflected candor and sincerity in his desire and intent to avoid future\nfinancial problems and continue serving the interests of national security with integrity.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider and apply the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG).\nIn addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative\nguidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to\nbe used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2, describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s\noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According\nto AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and (c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable\nguidelines in the context of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept.\nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this\n\n5\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded in mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201c[t]he applicant is\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the\nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Section 7\nof Executive Order 10865 provides, \u201c[a]ny determination under this order adverse to an\napplicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense\nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nA person applying for access to classified information seeks to enter into a\nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern pertaining to financial considerations:\nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially over-\nextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nCompulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes\nincluding espionage. Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources\nof income is also a security concern. It may indicate proceeds from\nfinancially profitable criminal acts.\nAG \u00b6 19 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying. Department Counsel argued for the applicability of two of these potentially\ndisqualifying conditions in this case: (a) \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;\u201d and\n(c) \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d (Tr. at 112.) \n\n6\nApplicant purchased a home that he could afford in 2004. However, he was laid\noff about eight months later through no fault of his own. He worked diligently to find new\nwork, but that required him to relocate to Florida due to a deteriorating job market. After\na year, he was transferred to a more permanent position in the Northwest, and he tried\nto sell or rent his house so his family could join him. Eventually, family separation was\nno longer tenable and his wife and children moved north to join him, leaving the home\nvacant. He continued to make payments on both mortgage loans for eight more months,\nuntil he could no longer afford to do so in November 2007. At that point, he was unable\nto satisfy those two debts, raising potential security concerns under AG \u00b6 19(a). He was\nsubsequently able to satisfy the first mortgage through the lender\u2019s repossession of the\nproperty in a foreclosure sale in September 2008. He then negotiated a settlement of\nthe second loan with the collection agency, which he paid in May 2009. He lives easily\nwithin his means, paid all of his other debts throughout the time in question, and is no\nlonger unable or unwilling to satisfy any debts. \nThis 18-month period when Applicant\u2019s mortgage loans were in default\nconstitutes a relatively brief, and minor, history of not meeting financial obligations. The\ncircumstances under which it arose were not his fault, and neither support concerns\nabout poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and\nregulations, nor raise questions about his reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information. AG \u00b6 19(c) was minimally established in this case.\nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising from\nthe foregoing financial considerations. Potentially applicable mitigating conditions are:\n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment;\n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control;\n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts; and\n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the\npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides\ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.\n\n7\nApplicant established mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(a) because his inability to sell or\nrent his home in a depressed real estate market, combined with the necessity to move\nfor employment and to reunite the family to care for their special-needs son, were one-\ntime events. He has stable, long-term employment and no intention to buy another\nhouse. He responded to these challenges in a most responsible manner, and kept his\ncreditor informed and involved in his attempts to resolve the debts. The problems he\nconfronted and resolved were not attributable to his conduct, and do not cast any doubt\non his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\nMitigation under AG \u00b6 20(b) was also clearly established. Applicant left Navy\nhousing when he retired, and bought a home he could afford. He was laid off when the\ncompany he joined lost the contract under which he worked, and he could find no other\nlocal employment at the beginning of the big economic downturn. The real estate\nmarket subsequently and unexpectedly crashed, making his home impossible to sell or\nrent despite vigorous efforts to do so by Applicant and his wife. As noted above, he kept\nhis lender, his supervisor, and his security manager informed of the pending inability to\ncontinue paying the mortgage loans, and acted as responsibly as possible under the\ncircumstances. \nApplicant engaged both real estate specialists and an attorney to counsel him on\noptions to best resolve his mortgage debt problems. The creditor chose to disregard the\n\u201cshort sale\u201d offer arranged by Applicant and his real estate agent that would have paid\nthem $205,000. Instead, the creditor bought the property from itself as the high bidder in\na foreclosure auction for $149,000. By this foreclosure action, the creditor knowingly\nvoided any remaining deficiency debt, and has since reported a zero balance due on\nthe loan to the credit bureaus. Applicant rejected the bankruptcy option suggested by\nhis attorney because he wanted to pay his creditors as best he could. He actively\nnegotiated a mutually agreeable payment with the collection agency to which his second\nloan had been transferred, and paid it in full. Thus, both debts that initially gave rise to\nsome security concerns have been fully resolved, and Applicant has no other delinquent\ndebt. He is also living within his means and is highly unlikely to incur new delinquencies.\nAny remaining security concerns are thus fully mitigated under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and (d).\nApplicant did not dispute either of his former delinquencies under AG \u00b6 20(e), and in\nfact admitted that they were valid debts. \nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\n\n8\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe pertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s conduct of\nsecurity concern was falling behind on two mortgage loans for reasons largely beyond\nhis control, and to which he responded in an engaged and responsible manner. Both\ndebts are now fully resolved, and new delinquencies are highly unlikely. Applicant is a\nmature and responsible individual, with a long track record of excellent performance\nwhile holding a very high level security clearance. He is now free of home ownership\nand mortgage obligations, and intends to remain that way. Any potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress has been fully alleviated by his resolution of the former\ndebts. \nApplicant fully mitigated security concerns arising from his brief history of failing\nto meet financial obligations, and his temporary inability to pay his delinquent mortgage\ndebts. The record generates significant confidence, and no doubts, as to his present\neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b: \nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance.

Goldstein, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nJanuary 25, 2010\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLOKEY ANDERSON, Darlene D., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP) dated October 9, 2008.  (Government Exhibit 1).  On June 12, 2009, the\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865\n(as amended), and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January\n2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed the\nreasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the\nDirective that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for the Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative\nJudge to determine whether a clearance should be denied or revoked.\n The Applicant responded to the SOR on a date uncertain, and he requested a\nhearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.  This case was originally assigned to\nanother Administrative Judge on August 17, 2009.  The matter was reassigned to the\nundersigned on August 24, 2009.  A notice of hearing was issued on September 11,\n2009, scheduling the hearing for October 6, 2009.  At the hearing the Government\npresented seven exhibits, referred to Government Exhibits 1 to 7, which were admitted\n\n2\nwithout objection.  The Applicant presented one exhibit, referred to as Applicant\u2019s\nExhibit A and testified on his own behalf.  The record remained open until November 6,\n2009, to allow the Applicant the opportunity to submit additional documentation.  The\nApplicant submitted one Post-Hearing Exhibit, referred to as Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing\nExhibit A that was admitted without objection.  The official transcript (Tr.) was received\non October 13, 2009.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and\ntestimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe following Findings of Fact are based on the Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR,\nthe testimony and the exhibits.  The Applicant is 30 years old, and has an Associates\nDegree and one year toward a Bachelors Degree in Electronics Engineering.  He is\nemployed by a defense contractor as a Simulation Technician and is seeking to obtain a\nsecurity clearance in connection with his employment.  \nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the\nbasis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  After a complete and\nthorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the same,\nthe following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the\nSOR:\nParagraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations)  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for a security clearance because he is financially overextended\nand at risk to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe Applicant admits each of the nine delinquent debts set forth in the SOR\nunder this guideline.  (See Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR).  His delinquent debts total\napproximately $ 27,797.00.  Credit Reports of the Applicant dated October 29, 2008,\nMay 29, 2009, June 3, 2009, and September 28, 2009, collectively reflect each of the\ndelinquent debts set forth in the SOR.  (Government Exhibits 2, 3, 4, and 7).  Applicant\nattributes his financial difficulties to various periods of unemployment from May 2007\nthrough January 2008, November 2006 through February 2007, and October 2005\nthrough April 2005.  In April 2008, he was hired by his current employer and has been\nworking full time since then.  \nThe Applicant testified that he intends to resolve each of his delinquent debts.  At\nthis time, they all remain outstanding.  A debt owed to a creditor in the amount of\n$346.00 remains outstanding 1(a).  This was a medical bill he received while he was out\nof work and had no health insurance.  A debt owed to a creditor in the amount of $94.00\nremains outstanding 1(b).  Applicant has no idea what the debt is for, but plans to pay it\nwhen he finds out.  A debt to a creditor in the amount of $2,184.00 for a medical bill\nremains outstanding 1(c).  Two student loans the Applicant obtained for educational\nexpenses remain outstanding in the amounts of $5,564.00 and $7,231.00, respectively\n1(d) and 1(e).  A debt owed to a creditor in the amount of $7,197.00  for a repossessed\n\n3\nvehicle remains outstanding 1(f).  Applicant explained that his wife lost her job and they\ncould no longer make the payments on her vehicle.  A debt owed to a creditor in the\namount of $1,106.00 remains outstanding 1(g).  Applicant states that the debt is his\nwife\u2019s.  A debt owed to a creditor in the amount of $3,990.00 remains outstanding 1(h).\nApplicant believes the debt is charged off and he has no idea who is collecting on the\naccount.  A debt owed to a creditor for an unpaid medical bill in the amount of $121.00\nalso remains outstanding 1(h).        \nApplicant further explained that he has been unable to pay his delinquent debts\ndue to insufficient financial resources.  He is the sole provider of the family of four.  His\nwife is currently looking for work but has been unsuccessful at finding a job due to the\ndifficult economy.  The Applicant recently hired an attorney to file assist him with his\nindebtedness.  His attorney indicates that based upon the Applicant\u2019s income, expenses\nand indebtedness, he clearly qualifies for Chapter 7 Bankruptcy.  The attorney is in the\nprocess of filing the petition for Chapter 7 that will include each of the creditors listed in\nthe SOR.  (Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit A).    \nA letter of recommendation from the Applicant\u2019s lead technician, his shift\nsupervisor and his site manager indicate that the Applicant is a trusted and professional\nmember of the work unit.  He has earned great respect as a subordinate and co-worker\nand has progressed to a point where he is capable of functioning reliably with minimal\nsupervision.  He is highly recommended for a position of trust.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A).   \n \nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies divided into\n\"Disqualifying Factors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying Factors\nand Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations)\n18.  The Concern.  Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to\nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  An individual who\nis financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes including\nespionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a\nsecurity concern.  It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n19(a)  inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;\n19(c)  a history of not meeting financial obligations.\n\n4\nCondition that could mitigate security concerns:\n20(b) the condition that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the\nperson\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical\nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly\nunder the circumstance.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 18-19,  in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\na.  The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct;\nb.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation;\nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct;\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;\ne.  The extent to which participation is voluntary;\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral\nchanges;\ng.  The motivation for the conduct; \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress; and \n \ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\nan acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted\nupon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative\nprocess is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person\nconcept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable\nand unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions\nbased on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\n\n5\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order\n. . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned.\u201d\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn the defense industry, a security clearance is entrusted to civilian workers who\nmust be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information twenty-four hours per\nday, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore appropriately concerned when\navailable information indicates that an Applicant for such access may be involved in\ninstances of financial irresponsibility which demonstrates poor judgment or unreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the\nholding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then\nshifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation\nwhich is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The Applicant\nbears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant him a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the\nApplicant has been financially irresponsible (Guideline F).  This evidence indicates poor\njudgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.  Because of\nthe scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude there is a nexus or\nconnection with his security clearance eligibility.\nThe Applicant is currently indebted to at least nine creditors in the amount of\napproximately $27,797.00.  His numerous periods of unemployment obviously\ncontributed to, if not caused, his financial demise.  However, over the past year and a\nhalf, he has been working full time for his current employer, and he has done little to\nresolve his indebtedness.  He recently hired an attorney to file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy\nrelief, however, at the present time, the petition has not yet been filed and the debts\nhave not yet been discharged.  Although he plans to list in his petition each of the\ndelinquent debts set forth in the SOR, the process has only just begun and is far from\nbeing completed.  A promise to take remedial measures in the future is not evidence of\nreform and rehabilitation.   \nAs of yet, none of the delinquent debts in the SOR have been paid.  The\nApplicant is just starting the financial rehabilitation process and has some time to go\nbefore his delinquent debts are resolved.  At the present time, he has not presented\nsufficient evidence to demonstrate a track record of financial responsibility or that he\nhas resolved his financial indebtedness.  Considering all of the evidence, the Applicant\nhas not introduced persuasive evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is\nsufficient to overcome the Government's case.  \n\n6\nI have also considered the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d in evaluating the Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information, including his favorable letter of\nrecommendation.  Under the particular facts of this case, the totality of the conduct set\nforth under all of the guidelines viewed as a whole, support a whole person assessment\nof questionable judgement, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness\nto comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person\nmay not properly safeguard classified information.  \nThere is insufficient evidence of financial rehabilitation at this time.  Under\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations), Disqualifying Conditions 19(a) inability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts, and, 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations\napply.  Although Mitigating Condition 20(b) the condition that resulted in the financial\nproblem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstance applies, it is not controlling here.\nThe Applicant has worked full time for the past year and a half and has not resolved\neven one of his debts, not even a small one.  His financial problems remain current and\nthey are not isolated.  The Applicant has not initiated a prompt, good faith effort to repay\nhis overdue creditors or otherwise resolve his debts.   Accordingly, I find against the\nApplicant under Guideline F (Financial Considerations).  \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has failed to overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing his request for a security clearance.  Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\nallegations expressed in Paragraph 1 of the Government's Statement of Reasons.\n     \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: Against the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.b.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.c.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n \n    Subpara.  1.d.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.e.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.f.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.g.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.h.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n \n    Subpara.  1.i.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n\n7\nDECISION\nIn light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interests to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant.\n  Darlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Borgstrom, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nANTHONY, Joan Caton, Administrative Judge: \n \n \nAfter a thorough review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, I conclude that \nApplicant failed to rebut or mitigate the Government\u2019s security concerns under Guideline \nF, Financial Considerations. His eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \nApplicant completed an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing \n(e-QIP) on October 11, 2008. On December 9, 2008, he was interviewed by an \nauthorized investigator from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and \nprovided information about his financial obligations. On January 7, 2010, the Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F, Financial Considerations. DOHA \nacted under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n    \nNovember 30, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                           \n \nApplicant submitted two responses to the SOR, one February 15, 2010, and the \nother a short time later.1 He requested that his case be adjudicated on the written \nrecord in lieu of a hearing. The Government compiled its File of Relevant Material \n(FORM) on July 7, 2010. The FORM contained documents identified as Items 1 through \n9. By letter dated July 15, 2010, DOHA forwarded a copy of the FORM to Applicant, \nwith instructions to submit any additional information or objections within 30 days of \nreceipt. Applicant received the file on July 23, 2010. His response was due on August \n22, 2010. He did not file any information in response to the FORM. On October 20, \n2010, the case was assigned to me for a decision.  \n \n                                                      Findings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR contains 15 allegations of financial delinquency under AG F, Financial \nConsiderations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.o.). The 15 allegations total approximately \n$22,061. In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted nine Guideline F allegations (\u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a., 1.c., 1.d., 1.e., 1.f., 1.g., 1.i., 1.j., and 1.o.). He denied six Guideline F allegations \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b., 1.h., 1.k., 1.l., 1.m., and 1.n.). Applicant\u2019s admissions are entered as \nfindings of fact.  (Item 1; Item 2; Item 3.) \n \n \nApplicant is 53 years old and is a high school graduate. Since September 2008, \nhe has been employed as a carpenter by a Government contractor. From October 1994 \nto September 2008, he was employed as a foreman by a private company. He and his \nwife have been married for 30 years, and they are the parents of three adult children.  \nApplicant has not previously held a security clearance. (Item 4; Item 6.)  \n \n \nWhen Applicant completed his e-QIP in October 2008, he answered \u201cYes\u201d when \nasked if, in the last seven years, he had been over 180 days delinquent on any debt. He \nalso answered \u201cYes\u201d when he was asked if he was currently over 90 days delinquent on \nany debt. He reported on his e-QIP that he was delinquent on an $800 credit card debt \nincurred in 2003. (Item 4 at 26-27.) \n \n \nApplicant was interviewed by an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) \ninvestigator about his finances on December 9, 2008. The investigator asked Applicant \nabout accounts that were delinquent or in collection status and identified on his credit \nreport of November 13, 2008. Applicant explained that he only identified one account on \nhis e-QIP as delinquent because he did not know which other accounts might be \ndelinquent. In the interview, he acknowledged delinquent accounts identified on the \nSOR at \u00b6\u00b6 1.a., 1.b., 1.f., 1.g., 1.h., 1.i., 1.j., 1.k., 1.l., and 1.n.2 He stated that he didn\u2019t \n \n1 Applicant\u2019s second response to the SOR was not dated. His February 15, 2010, filing was notarized, \ndated, and signed.  (Item 3; Item 2.) \n \n2 In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the delinquent debts alleged at \u00b6\u00b6 1.a., 1.f., 1.g., 1.i., and \n1.j. In his answer to the SOR, he denied the debts alleged at \u00b6\u00b6 1.b., 1.h., 1.k., 1.l., and 1.n, all of which \nwere identified as unpaid on his credit reports of July 2010, November 2009, and November 2008.  \nApplicant failed to provide documentation to corroborate his denials of the debts. (Item 1; Item 2; Item 3; \nItem 7; Item 8; Item 9.)   \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                                                                                                                            \npay the accounts because he lacked the money to do so. He stated that his wife knew \nabout the delinquent accounts, and he stated he intended to pay them at some time in \nthe future.3 As of the date of the SOR, the debts remained unpaid. (Item 5 at 4-7; Item 7 \nat 7.) \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant also admitted three delinquent medical debts \nalleged at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c., 1.d., and 1.e. The delinquent medical debts are listed on \nApplicant\u2019s credit report of November 2009. Applicant provided no documentation to \nestablish that the debts had been paid or otherwise resolved. (Item 2; Item 3; Item 8.) \n \n \nApplicant denied a $15,000 delinquent debt in collection status alleged at SOR \u00b6 \n1.m. The debt was listed on Applicant\u2019s November 2008 and November 2009 credit \nreports. However, Applicant\u2019s July 2010 credit report shows that the debt was settled for \na lesser amount in April 2010. (Item 2; Item 3; Item 7; Item 8; Item 9.) \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the debt alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.o., and \nhe asserted that the debt had been paid in full. However, Applicant\u2019s credit reports of \nJuly 2010 and November 2009 list the debt as charged off and delinquent since \nNovember 2004. Applicant failed to provide documentation to establish that the debt \nhad been satisfied. (Item 2; Item 3; Item 7; Item 8.) \n \n \nOn June 4, 2009, in response to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant provided a \npersonal financial statement. He reported a monthly net income of $2,941 and monthly \nliving expenses of approximately $1,900. His net monthly remainder is approximately \n$1,000. His personal financial statement did not reflect any payments on delinquent \ndebts. Nothing in the record reflects that Applicant has participated in consumer credit \ncounseling. (Item 6 at 5.) \nBurden of Proof \n \nThe Government has the initial burden of proving controverted facts alleged in \nthe SOR. To meet its burden, the Government must establish by substantial evidence a \nprima facie case that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest for an applicant \nto have access to classified information. The responsibility then shifts to the applicant to \nrefute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government's case. Because no one has a right to a \nsecurity clearance, the applicant carries a heavy burden of persuasion. The \"clearly \nconsistent with the national interest\" standard compels resolution of any reasonable \ndoubt about an applicant's suitability for access to classified information in favor of \nprotecting national security. \n  \n \n  \n3 On November 23, 2009, in response to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant signed a statement affirming \nthat he had read the summary of the interview and found it to be true and correct. He made no changes, \ncorrections, or revisions to the investigator\u2019s summaries. (Item 5.) \n \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     Policies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, and \nit has emphasized that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the \nNavy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \nan applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.    \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, the administrative judge applies these guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \nover-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking to obtain a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \n\n \n5 \n \n \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  \nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise \nsecurity concerns. Applicant has accumulated delinquent debt which has not been paid. \nThis evidence is sufficient to raise potentially disqualifying conditions under Guideline F. \n \nThe guideline also recites conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. Several Guideline F mitigating conditions could apply to the \nsecurity concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s financial delinquencies. Unresolved financial \ndelinquency might be mitigated if \u201cit happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d (AG \u00b6 20(a)). \nAdditionally, unresolved financial delinquency might be mitigated if \u201cthe conditions that \nresulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control,\u201d such as \n\u201closs of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, \ndivorce, or separation, and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d \n(AG \u00b6 20(b)). Still other mitigating circumstances that might be applicable include \nevidence \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control\u201d (AG \u00b6 \n20(c) or \u201cthe individual has initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts.\u201d (AG \u00b6 20 (d)).  Finally, security concerns related to financial \ndelinquencies might be mitigated if \u201cthe individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the \nlegitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \n\n \n6 \n \n \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of \nactions to resolve the issue.\u201d (AG \u00b6 20 (e)). \n   \nThe record in this case established that Applicant had satisfied for a lesser \namount the $15,000 debt alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.m. Accordingly, this allegation is \nconcluded for Applicant. Applicant\u2019s 14 remaining unresolved delinquent debts total \napproximately $7,061. \n  \nHowever, Applicant has a history of financial delinquencies that dates to at least \nthe period of 2003 and 2004. Most of the delinquencies alleged on the SOR remain \nunpaid and have occurred under circumstances that are likely to recur. Applicant lacks a \nclear and timely strategy for resolving his delinquent debts. While his most recent credit \nreport reflects that one debt alleged on the SOR has been paid or otherwise satisfied for \na lesser amount, the record is silent regarding consumer credit counseling.  \n \nApplicant has been employed by his present employer since September 2008, \nand he worked for another employer from 1994 until he took his present position. The \nrecord suggests that Applicant may have lacked financial resources to pay some of his \ndelinquent debts in the past. However, that does not appear to be the case now. His \nfinancial statement shows a monthly net remainder sufficient to pay or settle the \nunresolved delinquent debts listed on the SOR.  \n \n In December 2008, Applicant told the OPM investigator that he intended to pay \nhis delinquent debts in the future. Almost two years later, however, all but one of his \nfinancial delinquencies remain unresolved. In determining an individual's security \nworthiness, the Government cannot rely on the possibility that an applicant might \nresolve his or her outstanding debts at some future date. ISCR Case No. 98-0614 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Jul. 12, 1999). While Applicant receives some credit for settling the delinquent \ndebt alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.m., 14 of the 15 debts alleged on the SOR remain unresolved. \nAccordingly, I conclude that none of the Guideline F mitigating conditions apply fully to \nthe facts of Applicant\u2019s case. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n\n \n7 \n \n \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \n Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature adult.  He has \nbeen steadily employed since about 1994, and he reports a net remainder each month \nof approximately $1,000.  In his December 2008, interview with an OPM investigator, he \nstated he would take action to pay or otherwise satisfy his delinquent debts. While one \nof his debts has been settled, 14 remain unaddressed. Despite some financial strength, \nApplicant has failed to satisfy most of his delinquent debts, several of which are for \nrelatively small amounts of money. His failure to satisfy his creditors raises security \nconcerns about his judgment and reliability. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his financial \ndelinquencies.     \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST  APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. - 1.l.:            Against Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.m.:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.n. and 1.o.: \nAgainst Applicant \n \n      \n    \n \n \n              Conclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n                                           \n \n \n \n________________________________ \nJoan Caton Anthony \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Those admissions are incorporated as findings of fact. He denied the remaining allegation (\u00b6 1.h.). Applicant is a 38-year-old employee of a defense contractor, and he is seeking to obtain a security clearance, the level of which has not been specified. From February 1998 until June 2000, he was a technical manager for a defense contractor. That company was acquired and merged into another defense contractor, and Applicant remained in the same position with the new company until September 2008.10 He has been employed as a senior software engineer with his current employer, another government contractor, since October 2008.11 Applicant was born in 1972 in India.12 He initially came to the United States in August 1996, on a student visa, to pursue a master\u2019s degree in computer science, and he obtained the degree in December 1997.13 Upon receiving his degree, he decided to remain in the United States to work and reside.14 His progression from student visa to temporary visa, to permanent resident, culminated with his naturalization as a U.S. citizen in July 2008.15 In July 1997, while still a graduate student in the United States, Applicant returned to India briefly where he married his wife, a citizen and resident of India.16 She, too, became a naturalized U.S. citizen in July 2008.17 They now have two sons, both born in the Unite",

Michael Lyles, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Archibald J. Thomas, III, Esquire \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nGALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant mitigated the security concerns regarding foreign influence.  Eligibility \nfor a security clearance and access to classified information is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn September 15, 2008, Applicant applied for a security clearance and \nsubmitted both an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) and \nQuestionnaire for Sensitive Positions versions of a Security Clearance Application (SF \n86).1 On an unspecified date, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nfurnished him a set of foreign influence interrogatories. He responded to the \ninterrogatories on June 9, 2009.2 On an unspecified date, DOHA furnished him another \n \n1 Government Exhibit 1 (SF 86 - Archival Copy, dated September 15, 2008); Government Exhibit 1 (SF 86 - \nQuestionnaire for Sensitive Positions, dated September 15, 2008). Henceforth, because the Archival Copy of the SF \n86 is very difficult to read, and the information in it is identical to the other version of the SF 86, further references will \ncite the other version. \n \n2 Government Exhibit 2 (Applicant\u2019s Answers to Interrogatories, dated June 9, 2009). \nApril 1, 2011\n\n \n2 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \nset of interrogatories. He responded to the interrogatories on June 9, 2009.3 On April \n15, 2010, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant to Executive \nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), \nas amended and modified; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and \nmodified (Directive); and Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access \nto Classified Information (effective within the Department of Defense on September 1, \n2006) (AG) for all adjudications and other determinations made under the Directive. The \nSOR alleged security concerns under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) and detailed \nreasons why DOHA could not make a preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security \nclearance for Applicant. The SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to \ndetermine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  \n \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on April 23, 2010. In a sworn \nstatement, dated April 28, 2010, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel indicated the \nGovernment was prepared to proceed on July 8, 2010, and the case was assigned to \nme on August 4, 2010. A Notice of Hearing was issued on August 23, 2010, and I \nconvened the hearing, as scheduled, on September 24, 2010. \n \nDuring the hearing, 2 Government exhibits (GE 1-2) and 11 Applicant exhibits \n(AE A-I, AE K-L) were admitted into evidence, without objection. There was no AE J. \nApplicant and three other witnesses testified. The transcript of the hearing (Tr.) was \nreceived on October 1, 2010. \n \nRulings on Procedure \n \nAt the commencement of the hearing, Department Counsel requested that I take \nadministrative notice of certain enumerated facts pertaining to India, appearing in 15 \nwritten submissions. Facts are proper for administrative notice when they are easily \nverifiable by an authorized source and relevant and material to the case. In this \ninstance, the Government relied on source information regarding India in publications of \nthe U.S. Department of State,4 U.S. Department of Justice,5 U.S. Department of \n \n \n3 Government Exhibit 3 (Applicant\u2019s Answers to Interrogatories, dated June 9, 2009). \n \n4 U.S. Department of State, Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs, Background Note: India, dated \nNovember 2, 2009; U.S. Department of State, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, 2009 Human Rights \nReports: India, dated March 11, 2010; U.S. Department of State, Bureau of Consular Affairs, Travel Alert, dated May \n13, 2010; U.S. Department of State, Office of the Coordinator for Counterterrorism, Country Reports: South and \nCentral Asia Overview, Country Reports on Terrorism 2008, dated April 30, 2009; U.S. Department of State, Country \nSpecific Information: India, dated February 17, 2010; and U.S. Department of State, Bureau of Public Affairs, U.S. \u2013 \nIndia Agreements and Achievements, dated July 20, 2009. \n \n5 U.S. Department of Justice, Press Release, Businessman Pleads Guilty to Supplying Indian Government \nwith Controlled Technology, dated March 13, 2008. \n \n\n \n3 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \nCommerce,6 the Congressional Research Service,7 and the Office of the National \nCounterintelligence Executive.8 \n \nThe seven press releases were presented apparently to substantiate that India \nactively pursues collection of U.S. economic and propriety information, and, therefore, \nApplicant\u2019s relationships with his various family members and extended family members \nin India raises suspicion of him. None of the cases cited involves Applicant personally or \ninvolved espionage through any familial relationship. The anecdotal evidence of criminal \nwrongdoing of other U.S. citizens is of decreased relevance to an assessment of \nApplicant\u2019s security suitability, especially where there is no evidence that Applicant, or \nany member of his family or extended family, was ever involved in any aspect of the \ncited cases or ever targeted by any Indian intelligence official. Furthermore, these press \nreleases are little more than self-congratulatory public relations products issued by \npublic relations offices, with the collateral effect of deterring other criminals \ncontemplating possible attacks on our national security. \n \nAfter weighing the reliability of the source documentation and assessing the \nrelevancy and materiality of the facts proposed by the Government, pursuant to Rule \n201, Federal Rules of Evidence, I take administrative notice of certain facts,9 as set \nforth below under the India subsection. However, while I do not reject the facts set forth \nin the various press releases, the inference that somehow Applicant or his family, or his \nextended family participated in criminal activity was not argued during the hearing and is \nspecifically rejected.  \n \n \n6 U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security, Press Release: Export Privileges Denied \nto Indian Corporation and Three Executives, dated December 7, 2007; U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of \nIndustry and Security, Press Release: California Man to Plead Guilty in Plot to Export Restricted Technology to India, \ndated July 30, 2007; U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security, Press Release: High-Tech \nFirms/Executives Sentenced in Export Case, dated November 21, 2005; U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of \nIndustry and Security, Press Release: Chyron Corporation Settles Charges of Unlicensed Export to India, dated \nAugust 30, 2004; U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security, Press Release: Berkeley \nNucleonics Corporation Settles Charges of Unlicensed Exports, dated June 28, 2004; and U.S. Department of \nCommerce, Bureau of Industry and Security, Press Release: Sentry Settles Charges of Unlicensed Exports, dated \nJune 25, 2004.  \n \n7 Congressional Research Service, Library of Congress, India \u2013 U.S. Relations, dated January 30, 2009. \n \n8 Office of the National Counterintelligence Executive, Annual Report to Congress on Foreign Economic \nCollection and Industrial Espionage, FY 2008, dated July 23, 2009. \n \n9 Administrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for administrative proceedings. See \nMcLeod v. Immigration and Naturalization Service, 802 F.2d 89, 93 n.4 (3d Cir. 1986); ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4 \nn.1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, 2007); ISCR Case No. 02-24875 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-18668 \nat 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2004)). The most common basis for administrative notice at ISCR proceedings, is to notice \nfacts that are either well known or from government reports. See Stein, ADMINISTRATIVE LAW, Section 25.01 \n(Bender & Co. 2006) (listing fifteen types of facts for administrative notice). Requests for administrative notice may \nutilize authoritative information or sources from the internet. See, e.g. Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, 126 S.Ct. 2749 (2006) \n(citing internet sources for numerous documents).

Those admissions are incorporated as \nfindings of fact. He denied the remaining allegation (\u00b6 1.h.). \n \nApplicant is a 38-year-old employee of a defense contractor, and he is seeking to \nobtain a security clearance, the level of which has not been specified.  From February \n1998 until June 2000, he was a technical manager for a defense contractor. That \ncompany was acquired and merged into another defense contractor, and Applicant \nremained in the same position with the new company until September 2008.10 He has \nbeen employed as a senior software engineer with his current employer, another \ngovernment contractor, since October 2008.11  \n \nApplicant was born in 1972 in India.12 He initially came to the United States in \nAugust 1996, on a student visa, to pursue a master\u2019s degree in computer science, and \nhe obtained the degree in December 1997.13 Upon receiving his degree, he decided to \nremain in the United States to work and reside.14 His progression from student visa to \ntemporary visa, to permanent resident, culminated with his naturalization as a U.S. \ncitizen in July 2008.15  \n \nIn July 1997, while still a graduate student in the United States, Applicant \nreturned to India briefly where he married his wife, a citizen and resident of India.16 She, \ntoo, became a naturalized U.S. citizen in July 2008.17 They now have two sons, both \nborn in the United States, in 2001 and 2007, respectively.18  \n \nApplicant\u2019s father, now afflicted with dementia, a form of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, \nwas born in India in 1934, before India had achieved independence from the United \nKingdom, and he is a citizen-resident of India.19 He retired in about 1992 from his \nposition as a bank officer.20 Applicant\u2019s mother was born in India in 1940,21 also before \n \n10 Government Exhibit 1, supra note 1, at 4-5.  \n \n11 Tr. at 66. \n \n12 Government Exhibit 1, supra note 1, at 2.  \n \n13 Id. at 4; Tr. at 74. \n \n14 Tr. at 74. \n \n15 Id. at 74-75; Government Exhibit 1, supra note 1, at 2. \n \n16 Government Exhibit 1, at 6. \n \n17 Id.  \n \n18 Id. at 7-8. \n \n19 Id. at 7; Applicant\u2019s Response to the SOR, dated April 28, 2010, at 4. \n \n20 Government Exhibit 2, supra note 2, at 4. \n \n\n \n5 \n                                      \n \n.\n  \n                                                                                                                                                                                          \nindependence, and she too is a citizen-resident of India.22 She has always been a \nhomemaker, and has never worked outside of the family residence.23 Neither parent \nhas ever had any affiliation with the Indian government or intelligence service 24\n \nApplicant has two brothers and one sister. One brother is a professional \nphotographer, with his own photo studio; the other brother is an engineer, working for \nan American company; and his sister is a physician, working in a private hospital.25 All \nare citizen-residents of India.26 None of his siblings has ever had any affiliation with the \nIndian government or intelligence service.27 \n \nThe parents and brother of Applicant\u2019s wife are also citizen-residents of India.28 \nHis father-in-law, currently semi-retired, was a small business owner.29 His mother-in-\nlaw is a homemaker who occasionally assisted her husband at his workplace.30 His \nbrother-in-law is a small business owner now running the family business.31 No member \nof this segment of Applicant\u2019s extended family has ever had any affiliation with the \nIndian government or intelligence service.32 \n \nApplicant also has several casual friends, originally from India. Applicant met \nthese individuals either while attending various schools in India, or the United States, or \nas coworkers in the United States. These contacts now work and reside in the United \nStates. Some of them have become U.S. citizens.33 None of his casual friends has ever \nhad any affiliation with the Indian government or intelligence service.34 \n \nThe frequency of Applicant\u2019s on-going contacts with the members of his family, \nextended family, and casual friends is varied.

While he owned a residential property in India, the interaction \nwas more frequent, generally related to the property. Now, however, the property has \nbeen sold and they do not maintain communication.38 Applicant does not maintain \ncommunication with his brother-in-law, and it has been one year since they last spoke.39 \nSince Applicant relocated and took his current position, he has had infrequent contact \nwith most of his casual friends.40  \n \nWhen Applicant and his wife became naturalized U.S. citizens, they took an oath \nof allegiance to the United States.  That oath included the words:41 \n \nI hereby declare, on oath, that I absolutely and entirely renounce and \nabjure all allegiance and fidelity to any foreign prince, potentate, state, or \nsovereignty, of whom or which I have heretofore been a subject or citizen.  \n \n \nApplicant explained the emotions of the moment:42 \n \nThe day I took oath with my wife was a very emotional day for me. Having \ngone through various stages applying for a temporary visa, it was very \nemotional for me and my wife to finally be recognized as United States \ncitizens. It is something that both my wife and I are very proud. \n \nAnd being registered to vote, that was an emotional day to me to be \nactually able to vote during the presidential elections back in 2008. We\u2019re \nvery proud to be American citizens. I have no loyalty to India or any other \ncountry. This is our home now. This is where I want to see my children \ngrow up and be successful in their careers. \n \nIn November 2004, during a booming real estate market in India, Applicant and \nhis wife purchased a residential rental property in India for US$241,223, with a \n \n35 Id. at 4. \n \n36 Id. \n \n37 Id. at 4, 7. \n \n38 Id. at 5. \n \n39 Id. \n \n40 Id. \n \n41 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 337.1(a) (1995). \n \n42 Tr. at 77. \n \n\n \n7 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \nmortgage loan from an Indian bank.43 At the same time, he opened a bank account in \nIndia to deposit rental income and mortgage payments.44 He rented the property for \nUS$1,062 per month.45 Applicant\u2019s in-laws helped with the closing costs and served \nessentially as the local property managers.46 Applicant estimated that his monthly net \nincome from the rent, after taxes and one-half of the rent being retained by his in-laws, \nwas US$448.47 In July 2008, Applicant\u2019s in-laws gave their daughter and Applicant a gift \nby paying off the remainder of the mortgage.48 In December 2008, Applicant estimated \nthe value of the property to be about US$350,000.49 On November 25, 2009, Applicant \nand his wife sold the property for approximately US$570,000.50 The proceeds from the \nsale were initially deposited in their bank account in India in December 2009,51 and \nimmediately transferred to their joint bank account in the United States.52 On December \n7, 2009, Applicant informed his facility security officer of the sale of the property and the \nrepatriation of funds.53 \n \nIn April 2010, Applicant and his wife purchased a residence in the United States \nfor $251,155.16.54 As of July 31, 2010, Applicant and his wife estimate they have a net \nworth in the United States, including their various 401(k) and IRA retirement plans, \ncollege savings plans, money market accounts, savings accounts, checking accounts, a \nrental property, their residence, automobiles, jewelry, and household goods, of \n$898,386.55  \nApplicant\u2019s only foreign financial assets are his two Indian bank accounts, \nestimated to be worth US$2,011 and US$314, respectively.56 They were maintained \n \n43 Government Exhibit 1, supra note 1, at 10-11; Personal Subject Interview, dated December 19, 2008, at 1, \nattached to Government Exhibit 3, supra note 3. \n \n44 Applicant\u2019s Response to the SOR, supra note 19, at 7; Tr. at 70-71. \n \n45 Government Exhibit 2, supra note 2, at 17. \n \n46 Personal Subject Interview, supra note 43, at 1. \n \n47 Government Exhibit 2, supra note 2, at 17. \n \n48 Personal Subject Interview, supra note 43, at 1. \n \n49 Id. \n \n50 Tr. at 67-68; Applicant Exhibit A (Sale Deed, dated November 25, 2009), at 6. \n \n51 Applicant Exhibit B (Detailed Statement, dated April 20, 2010), at 1. \n \n52 Applicant Exhibit C (Combined Statement, dated December 11, 2009), at 1. \n \n53 Applicant Exhibit H (E-mail to facility security officer, dated December 7, 2009). \n \n54 Applicant Exhibit D (Final Settlement Statement (HUD-1), dated March 31, 2010), at 1. \n \n55 Applicant Exhibit L (List of assets and liabilities, dated July 31, 2010).

In his opinion, Applicant\u2019s performance since his last \nreview has improved to an even higher level.65 Based on his observations and \ninteraction with Applicant, he believes that Applicant is trustworthy, and he supports \nApplicant\u2019s application for a security clearance.66 An associate manager with the prime \ncontractor was one of the members of the interviewing panel when Applicant was hired. \nHe has the highest respect for Applicant, his character, and his initiative,67 and he \n \n \n57 Applicant Exhibit H, supra note 53. \n \n58 Applicant\u2019s Response to the SOR, supra note 19, at 3. \n \n59 Id. \n \n60 Tr. at 76. \n \n61 Id. \n \n62 Applicant Exhibit I (Performance Review, dated March 2, 2010), at 5.

The relationship \nbetween India and Pakistan has been strained, if not actually hostile, ever since, \nessentially over a dispute about Kashmir. During the Cold War, India\u2019s foreign policy \nwas one of nonalignment with either of the two major power blocs. Nevertheless, while \nthe United States generally aligned itself with Pakistan, India moved closer to the Soviet \nUnion and received significant military support from the relationship. However, since the \ncollapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, India has moved closer to the United States. The \nUnited States and India are the world\u2019s largest democracies, and the United States is \nIndia\u2019s largest trade and investment partner. They have common principles and shared \nnational interests, including defeating terrorism, preventing weapons proliferation, and \nmaintaining regional stability. They are also both committed to political freedom \nprotected by representative government.  \n \nIn the course of its history since independence, two Indian prime ministers were \nassassinated; there have been continuing hostilities between India and Pakistan; and \nthere have been Islamic terrorist attacks in India, with the most recent attack occurring \nin 2008. After the Al-Qaeda attacks on the United States on September 11, 2001, Indian \nintelligence agencies provided the United States with substantial information on that \nterrorist organization\u2019s activities in Pakistan and Afghanistan. Since that time, the U.S.-\nIndia security cooperation has flourished, with greatly increased counterterrorism \ncooperation. U.S. diplomats rate military cooperation among the most important aspects \nof the transformed bilateral relations. The two countries have held a series of \nunprecedented and increasingly substantive combined military exercises. \n \nIn 2008, Secretary of State Clinton acknowledged the new administration\u2019s desire \nto \u201cfurther strengthen the excellent bilateral relationship\u201d between the two countries. \nNevertheless, disagreements exist. Some Indian officials express concern that the \nUnited States is a \u201cfickle\u201d partner that may not always be relied upon to provide the \nreciprocity, sensitivity, and high-technology transfers sought by India. Some U.S. \ngovernment officials have criticized India\u2019s extensive trade and investment barriers, its \nnuclear weapons programs, the pace of India\u2019s economic reforms, its human rights \npractices, and its inadequate laws and ineffective enforcement of intellectual property \nrights protection. \n \nUnder its constitution, India is a \u201csovereign, socialist, secular, democratic \nrepublic.\u201d It is a multiparty, federal, parliamentary democracy, with a bicameral \n                                                          \n \n68 Id. at 64-65. \n \n69 Applicant Exhibit G (Various e-mails, various dates). \n \n\n \n10 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \nparliament, including the Rajya Sabha (Council of States) and the Lok Sabha (House of \nthe People). While the central government has greater power in relation to its states, the \nposition of president is largely ceremonial. The real national executive power is \ncentered in the Cabinet (senior members of the Council of Ministers), led by the prime \nminister. India\u2019s independent judicial system began under the British, and its concepts \nand procedures resemble those of Anglo-Saxon countries. \n \nThere is evidence that India is an active participant in economic espionage, \nindustrial espionage or trade secret theft, or violations of export-control regulations. \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d70 As Commander in Chief, \nthe President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national \nsecurity and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access \nto such information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his \ndesignee to grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a \nfinding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d71   \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \n \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines \nare applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. \n \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d72 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish \na potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and it has the burden of \n \n70 Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). \n \n71 Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended \nand modified.    \n \n72 \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to \nsupport a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, \n2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1).  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  \nSee v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \n \n\n \n11 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced \nsubstantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \napplicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, \nextenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s \ncase. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.73  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as \nwell. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to \nrepose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants \naccess to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  \nFurthermore, \u201csecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of \ndenials.\u201d74 \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no \nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d75 Thus, nothing \nin this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole \nor in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, \nor patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict \nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a \nclearance. In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are \nreasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in \nAG \u00b6 6:       \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \n \n73 See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \n74 Egan, 484 U.S. at 531 \n \n75 See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \n \n\n \n12 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism. \nThe mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, \nas a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B.  However, if only one relative lives in \na foreign country, and an applicant has contacts with that relative, this factor alone is \nsufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the \ncompromise of classified information.76 Applicant\u2019s relationship with his parents, \nsiblings, in-laws, and his wife\u2019s sibling, as well as his financial interests in India, are \ncurrent security concerns for the Government. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG \u00b6 7(a), \u201ccontact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate, \nfriend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact \ncreates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or \ncoercion\u201d is potentially disqualifying. Similarly, under AG \u00b6 7(b), \u201cconnections to a \nforeign person, group, government, or country that create a potential conflict of interest \nbetween the individual's obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation\u201d may raise security concerns. In addition, under AG \u00b6 7(d), \u201csharing living \nquarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship status, if that relationship \ncreates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion,\u201d \nmay raise security concerns. Also, it is potentially disqualifying under AG \u00b6 7(e) if there \nexists \u201ca substantial business, financial, or property interest in a foreign country, or in \nany foreign-owned or foreign-operated business, which could subject the individual to \nheightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation.\u201d I find AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(b), 7(d), and \n7(e) apply in this case. However, the security significance of these identified conditions \nrequires further examination of Applicant\u2019s respective relationships with his family \nmembers and extended family members who are Indian citizen-residents, as well as \ncloser examination of his foreign financial interests, to determine the degree of \n\u201cheightened risk\u201d or potential conflict of interest.  \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from foreign influence. Under AG \u00b6 8(a), the disqualifying condition \nmay be mitigated where \u201cthe nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the \ncountry in which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, group, \norganization, or government and the interests of the U.S.\u201d Similarly, AG \u00b6 8(b) may \napply where the evidence shows \u201cthere is no conflict of interest, either because the \nindividual's sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or \ncountry is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of \ninterest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d In addition, AG \u00b6 8(c) may apply where \u201ccontact or \n \n76 See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 at 12 (App. Bd. \nFeb. 8, 2001). \n\n \n13 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \ncommunication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that there is little \nlikelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation.\u201d Also, AG \u00b6 8(f) \nmay apply when \u201cthe value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or \nproperty interests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not be \nused effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual.\u201d In this instance, \nApplicant\u2019s relationship with his parents and siblings is neither casual nor infrequent. \nAccordingly, AG \u00b6 8(c) does not apply as it pertains to them. However, considering \nApplicant\u2019s more casual and infrequent relationship with his brother-in-law, as well as \nhis evolving and more current infrequent relationship with his in-laws, AG \u00b6 8(c) does \napply. AG \u00b6 8(d) partially applies. \nIn assessing whether there is a heightened risk because of an applicant\u2019s \nrelatives or associates in a foreign country, it is necessary to consider all relevant \nfactors, including the totality of an applicant\u2019s conduct and circumstances, in light of any \nrealistic potential for exploitation. One such factor is the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress. In that regard, it is important to consider the character of the \nforeign power in question, including the government and entities controlled by the \ngovernment within the relevant foreign country.  Nothing in Guideline B suggests it is \nlimited to countries that are hostile to the United States.77 In fact, the Appeal Board has \ncautioned against \u201creliance on overly simplistic distinctions between \u2018friendly\u2019 nations \nand \u2018hostile\u2019 nations when adjudicating cases under Guideline B.\u201d78 \n \nNevertheless, the relationship between a foreign government and the United \nStates may be relevant in determining whether a foreign government or an entity it \ncontrols is likely to attempt to exploit a resident or citizen to take action against the \nUnited States. It is reasonable to presume that although a friendly relationship, or the \nexistence of a democratic government, is not determinative, it may make it less likely \nthat a foreign government would attempt to exploit a U.S. citizen through relatives or \nassociates in that foreign country. \n \nAs noted above, since the breakup of the Soviet Union, the United States and \nIndia have developed an increasingly warm and friendly relationship, making it unlikely \nthat the Indian government would attempt coercive means to obtain sensitive \ninformation.  However, it does not eliminate the possibility that India would employ some \nnon-coercive measures in an attempt to exploit a relative.  While Applicant\u2019s parents \nand siblings, as well as his in-laws and brother-in-law, still reside in India, there may be \nspeculation as to \u201csome risk,\u201d but that speculation, in the abstract, does not, without \nmore, establish sufficient evidence of a \u201cheightened risk\u201d of foreign exploitation, \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion to disqualify Applicant from holding a \nsecurity clearance. There is no evidence that Applicant\u2019s parents or siblings, or his in-\nlaws or brother-in-law are, or have been, political activists, challenging the policies of \nthe Indian government; that terrorists have approached or threatened Applicant or his \nparents or siblings, or his in-laws or brother-in-law, for any reason; that the Indian \n \n77 See ISCR Case No. 00-0317 at 6 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2002); ISCR Case No. 00-0489 at 12 (App. Bd. Jan. \n10, 2002). \n78 ISCR Case No. 00-0317 at 6 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2002). \n\n \n14 \n                                      \n \ngovernment has approached Applicant; that his parents or siblings, or his in-laws or \nbrother-in-law, currently engage in activities that would bring attention to themselves; or \nthat his parents or siblings, or his in-laws or brother-in-law, are even aware of \nApplicant\u2019s work. As such, there is a reduced possibility that they would be targets for \ncoercion or exploitation by the Indian government, which may seek to quiet those who \nspeak out against it. Applicant has met his burden of showing there is little likelihood \nthat those relationships could create a risk for foreign influence of exploitation. Applicant \nis fully involved in his children\u2019s lives and activities. He and his wife and children have \n\u201csuch deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that [they] can be \nexpected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d As to his \nparents and siblings in India, AG \u00b6 8(a) applies. As to his in-laws and brother-in-law, \u00b6 \n8(b) applies.  \n  \nApplicant has been a resident of the United States since 1996. He became a \nnaturalized U.S. citizen, and he, his wife, and their two children reside in the United \nStates. Now that he has sold the residential rental property in India, he no longer has \nany substantial foreign financial interests in India. The two bank accounts he maintains \nin India, are jointly worth an estimated $2,325. They are still open to enable him to \nreceive a possible tax refund associated with the sale of the Indian property, and they \nare insignificant in comparison to Applicant\u2019s overall $898,386 net worth. That interest is \ntoo insignificant to be \u201cused effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure [Applicant].\u201d  \nAG \u00b6 8(f) applies. \n \nIt is true that, before becoming a U.S. citizen in 2008, Applicant had taken five \ntrips to India during which he visited his parents. Those trips should have no current \nsecurity significance.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \n\n \n15 \n                                      \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant and his \u201cclosest family\u201d --\nhis wife and two children -- are U.S. citizens residing in the United States. His Indian-\nborn friends all work in the United States, and as everyone has matured their respective \nrelationships have evolved into more casual and distant relationships. Applicant is not \nvulnerable to direct coercion or exploitation through his wife or children, or even through \nhis casual friends now residing in the United States, and the realistic possibility of \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress with regard to them is low. \n \nA Guideline B decision concerning India must take into consideration the \ngeopolitical situation in that country, as well as the potential dangers existing there. \nIndia, as is true with the United States, is a democracy with advanced nuclear \ncapabilities.  Both countries have both been victims of Islamic terrorists. Because both \nnations share a common vision for the future, it is in India\u2019s interests to maintain \nfriendship with the U.S. to counterbalance international terrorism. It is very unlikely India \nwould forcefully attempt to coerce Applicant through his parents, siblings, in-laws, or \nbrother-in-law, all still residing in India. Furthermore, while there is evidence that India is \nan active participant in economic espionage, industrial espionage or trade secret theft, \nor violations of export-control regulations, there is no evidence that Applicant has been \ntargeted.   \n \nAs noted above, Applicant\u2019s entire life is now centered in the United States. This \nis where his children are growing up and where they have school, friends, and \ninvolvement in community and school affairs. He is well respected by his friends and \ncolleagues for his honesty, integrity, and truthfulness. That he and his parents keep in \nclose contact should not be considered a negative factor. (See AG && 2(a)(1) through \n2(a)(9).) \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his foreign influence \nconcerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n\n \n16 \n                                      \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.i:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.j:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is  \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.
