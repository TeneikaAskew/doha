HARVEY \n \n \nAPPEARANCES\n \nFOR GOVERNMENT \nD. Michael Lyles, Esq., Department Counsel \n \nFOR APPLICANT \nPro Se \n \n \nSYNOPSIS \n \nApplicant has 10 delinquent debts listed on his statement of reasons. He paid two debts, \ntwo are duplications, one is disputed, and the other five are being resolved through payment plans. \nIn 2005, he failed to list delinquent debts as required on his Security Clearance Application (SF \n86); however, he did disclose on his SF 86 that financial considerations were an issue. Security \nconcerns pertaining to financial considerations and personal conduct are mitigated.  Eligibility for \na security clearance is granted. \n \n \n \n \n                                                                                                                      \n \n1\n \n\n \n                                                                                                                      \n \n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\n \nOn June 2, 2005, Applicant submitted a Security Clearance Application (SF 86).1 On \nApril 11, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to him,2 under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nWithin Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), \ndated January 2, 1992, as amended, modified and revised.3 The SOR alleges security concerns \nunder Guidelines F (Financial Considerations) and E (Personal Conduct). The SOR detailed \nreasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for him, \nand recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be \ngranted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n \nIn an answer notarized on May 9, 2007, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and \nelected to have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.4 A complete copy of \nthe file of relevant material (FORM), dated July 30, 2007, was provided to him on August 8, \n2007, and he was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, \nextenuation, or mitigation.5 Submissions were due by September 7, 2007.6 On August 31, 2007, \nApplicant responded to the FORM and provided additional documents. On September 10, 2007, \nDepartment Counsel declined to object to Applicant\u2019s additional documents. The case was \nassigned to me on September 14, 2007. \n \n \nFINDINGS OF FACT  \n \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted some debts, said two debts were \nduplications of each other, and asserted two debts were paid. He denied one debt. The details of \nhis debt situation will be described in detail in the findings of fact, supra. He denied knowingly \n                                                          \n1Item 4 (Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) also known as Standard Form (SF) \n86, Security Clearance Application). There is an allegation of falsification of Sections 28a and 28b of this SF 86. \n \n2Item 1 (Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated April 11, 2007). Item 1 is the source for the facts in the \nremainder of this paragraph unless stated otherwise. \n \n3On August 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a memorandum directing \napplication of revised Adjudicative Guideline to all adjudications and other determinations made under the Directive \nand Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program (Regulation), dated January \n1987, as amended, in which the SOR was issued on or after September 1, 2006.  The revised Adjudicative \nGuidelines apply to this case. \n \n4Item 2 (Applicant\u2019s response to SOR, notarized on May 9, 2007).  \n \n5Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) transmittal letter, is dated July 31, 2007, and \nApplicant\u2019s receipt is dated August 8, 2007.  \n \n6Id. The DOHA transmittal letter informed Applicant that he had 30 days after Applicant\u2019s receipt to \nsubmit information.  \n\n \n                                                                                                                      \n \n3\nfalsifying his SF 86. His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete \nand thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following additional findings of fact.   \n \nApplicant is 52 years old.7 He attended a state university for several months in 1975, and \na technical university for several months in 1976. From 1979 to 2000, he was on active duty in \nthe Air Force, and retired with at the rank of Master Sergeant (E-7). He married in 1977 and \ndivorced in 1991. He married again in 1991 and divorced in 2004. His three children were born \nin 1977, 1979, and 1980.8 He recently remarried.9 A defense contractor has employed him since \n2002 as an engineer in quality assurance.  The Veterans Administration provides Applicant a \ndisability payment for his 60% disability rating (Ex. 2, atch. 9). \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nThe SOR listed ten debts, which are described as follows: \n \n SOR \n\u00b6  \n SOR      \nAmount \nAccount Type and Current Status \n\u00b6 1.a \n$1,371 \nDebt for dental care\u2014payment plan, but only payment made was in June \n2007 (Item 2 at 1; Response to FORM at 6)   \n\u00b6 1.b \n$1,954 \nCredit card\u2014payment plan (Item 2 at 1 & atch. 2; Response to FORM at 6) \n\u00b6 1.c \n$2,438 \nDuplication of \u00b6 1.f\u2014payment plan (Item 2 at 1; Response to FORM at 6)  \n\u00b6 1.d \n$3,472 \nCredit account\u2014payment plan (Item 2 at 1; Response to FORM at 6) \n\u00b6 1.e \n$1,395 \nCredit card account\u2014paid (Item 2 at 1 and atch. 3) \n\u00b6 1.f \n$6,210 \nDuplication of \u00b6 1.c\u2014payment plan (Item 2 at 2; Response to FORM at 6)  \n\u00b6 1.g \n$2,161 \nDuplication of \u00b6 1.h\u2014payment plan (Item 2 at 2; Response to FORM at 6) \n\u00b6 1.h \n$2,280 \nDuplication of \u00b6 1.g\u2014payment plan (Item 2 at 2; Response to FORM at 6) \n\u00b6 1.i \n$1,275 \nPaid on June 26, 2003\u2014(Item 2 at 3 and atch. 4) \n\u00b6 1.j \n$350 \nUnknown account (Item 2 at 2) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a is for $1,371.  In his response to the SOR, Appellant said \nthis debt was for dental care, and it was in a payment plan (Item 2 at 1). He previously filed to \nget the debt paid by his insurance; however, his insurance declined to pay (Item 2 at 1). The \noriginal debt was reported in January 2007 in the amount of $832 (Item 5 at 27).  The Response \nto the FORM at 6, shows a payment on June 14, 2007, of $46.   \n                                                          \n7Item 4, supra n. 1, is the source for the facts in this paragraph, unless otherwise stated.   \n \n8 His divorce decree indicates there was a child born of that marriage in 1991 (Item 2, atch. 6).  This child \nis not listed on his SF 86. \n   \n9 Response to FORM at 2. \n \n\n \n                                                                                                                      \n \n4\n \nApplicant\u2019s debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b is for $1,954. He set up a payment plan, and agreed to pay \na credit counseling company (CCC) $330 per month (Item 5 at 10-15). CCC agreed to disburse \npayments to Applicant\u2019s creditors. Id. For the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.b, his CCC account statement \nshows payments on June 14, 2007 ($62), July 16, 2007 ($70) and August 14, 2007 ($70) to the \ncreditor in SOR \u00b6 1.b (Response to FORM at 6). \n \nApplicant\u2019s debt in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.f are duplications and the total debt is $6,210 (Item \n2 at 2, Item 5 at 15).  The CCC statement shows payments to the creditor in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.f \non February 14, 2007 ($139), March 14, 2007 ($139), April 17, 2007 ($281), May 14, 2007 \n($139), June 14, 2007 ($138), and July 16, 2007 ($155) (Response to FORM at 6). \n \nApplicant\u2019s debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d is $2,753 (Item 2 at 2, Item 5 at 15). CCC disbursed seven \npayments to the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.d between February 14, 2007, and August 14, 2007, ranging \nin amounts from $126 to $155 (Response to FORM at 6).   \n \nApplicant\u2019s debt in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g and 1.h are duplications and the total debt is $2,343 (Item \n2 at 2, Item 5 at 15). CCC disbursed seven payments to the creditor in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g and 1.h \nbetween February 14, 2007, and August 14, 2007, ranging in amounts from $47 to $53 \n(Response to FORM at 6).   \n \nApplicant had a bitter divorce and attributes his financial problems to the divorce. He has \nrecently remarried and his wife has a positive attitude towards financial responsibility and good \ncredit (Response to the Form at 2).  His wife is a federal employee (GS 7, Step 7) and earns an \nannual salary of about $42,000 per year (Item 5 at 21). She has a federal service comp date of \n1989. Id. Applicant\u2019s gross pay is also about $42,000 per year (Item 5 at 14). Applicant has had a \nclearance for more than twenty years, and there is no evidence of a security violation.  Id.  He \nreceived financial counseling.     \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \nSection 28 of Applicant\u2019s June 2, 2005, SF 86 asks, \u201cSection 28: Your Financial \nDelinquencies  Answer the following questions.  \n \na. In the last 7 years, have you been over 180 days delinquent on any debt(s)? \n \nb. Are you currently over 90 days delinquent on any debt(s)? \n \nApplicant placed an \u201cx\u201d in the \u201cNo\u201d portion after each question. In the Additional \nComments portion of Section 28 on this SF 86 he indicated, \u201cAfter divorce I enrolled in \nConsumer Credit Counseling and Debt Management\u201d (emphasis in original). \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b allege that the correct answer is \u201cYes,\u201d and that he deliberately failed \nto disclose the delinquent debts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.j.  In the FORM at 6, Department \n\n \n                                                                                                                      \n \n5\nCounsel noted that a credit report showed that two delinquent debts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.h \nwere delinquent prior to Applicant signing his SF 86.10  \n \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant said he referred back to his SF 86 worksheet \n\u201cModule [2]8,\u201d and his answer was \u201cYes.\u201d He admitted he made a mistake, apparently when he \nfailed to ensure the worksheet and the SF 86 included the same information. He made another \nmistake when he failed to carefully read his answers to the two financial questions in Sections \n28a and 28b on the printed SF 86 before signing it (Item 2 at 2). I accept his statement about \nmaking these mistakes as accurate. I conclude he did not intend to deceive security officials.   \n \n \nPOLICIES\n \nIn an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s security suitability, an administrative judge must \nconsider the \u201cAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified \nInformation\u201d (AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the AGs are \ndivided into Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC), which a judge uses \nto determine an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \n \nThese AGs are not inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities \nof human behavior, they are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. AG \u00b6 2. A judge\u2019s over-arching goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nBecause the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole person concept,\u201d a judge considers all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. AG \u00b6 2(c). \n \n \nSpecifically, a judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 \n2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding \nthe conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the \nconduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \n \n \n \nSince the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the final \ndecision in each case is arrived at by applying the standard that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning \npersonnel being considered for access to classified information will be resolved in favor of \nnational security.\u201d AG \u00b6 2(b). In reaching this decision, a judge must draw only those \nconclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence contained in the record. \nLikewise, a judge must avoid drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \n                                                          \n10 Department Counsel accurately cited a credit summary dated June 11, 2005, in support of his contention \nthat Applicant was well aware of his delinquent debts. The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b was charged off in 2003, and the debt \nin SOR \u00b6 1.h was reported delinquent in March 2005. See Item 8.   \n \n\n \n                                                                                                                      \n \n6\nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d11 \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a case which \ndemonstrates, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information. Once the \nGovernment has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, the burden shifts to \napplicant to present \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts \nadmitted by applicant or proven by the [Government], and [applicant] has the ultimate burden of \npersuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 \nat 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).12\n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship transcends normal \nduty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government reposes a high degree of \ntrust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to classified information. Decisions \nunder this Directive include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk an applicant may \ndeliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions \nentail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk \nof compromise of classified information. \n  \nThe scope of a judge\u2019s decision is limited. Nothing in this Decision should be construed \nto suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied \ndetermination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.  Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.  \n \n \nCONCLUSIONS\n  \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate \nlegal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly above, I conclude the \nfollowing with respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR: \n \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the Government\u2019s concern concerning financial problems. \u201cFailure or \ninability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate \npoor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of \n                                                          \n11 \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to \nsupport a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. \nAug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1).  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the \npossibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from \nbeing supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966).  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area \nTransit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \n \n12\u201cThe Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and unfavorable, \nevaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the Directive, and decide[s] \nwhether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 \n(App. Bd. July 6, 2006).  \n\n \n                                                                                                                      \n \n7\n                                                          \nwhich can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to \nengage in illegal acts to generate funds.\u201d \n  \n  \nTwo Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and \u201ca history \nof not meeting financial obligations.\u201d AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and (c).   \n \n  \nApplicant had ten delinquent debts alleged in the SOR. The debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.i \nwere paid. The debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h and 1.f were duplications.  The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.j for $350 \nwas not established. Moreover, the only proof of the SOR \u00b6 1.j debt is a credit report, and \nApplicant consistently denied the debt.   \n \n  \nThe five remaining debts were placed into payment plans (although only one payment \nwas made on the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a).  Repayment of all debts is particularly noteworthy because \ncollection of at least one debt (the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b) may have been barred by Texas\u2019 4-year \nstatute of limitations.13\n  \n  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)-(e) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n13 See Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code \u00a7\u00a7 16.004(c) and 16.051 (statute of limitations for contracts); \n16.004(a)(3) (statute of limitations for debts); Cont\u2019l Casualty Co. v. Dr. Pepper Bottling Co. of Tex., 416 F.Supp. \n2d 497, 505-507 (W.D. Tex. 2006); Facility Ins. Corp. v. Employers Ins. of Wausau, 357 F.3d 508, 513-514 (5th Cir. \n2004) (discussing statute of limitations for open or revolving accounts).  Creditor collection of the debts legally \nbarred by the Texas statute of limitations is barred. However, Applicant\u2019s payments on his debts have reinstated \nthem, ending the statute of limitations defense to collection. See Stine v. Stewart, 80 S.W.3d 586, 591, 45 Tex. \nSup.J. 966 (Tex. 2002).   \n \nThe South Carolina Court of Appeals succinctly explained the societal and judicial value of application of \nthe statute of limitations: \n \nStatutes of limitations embody important public policy considerations in that they stimulate \nactivity, punish negligence and promote repose by giving security and stability to human affairs.  \nThe cornerstone policy consideration underlying statutes of limitations is the laudable goal of law \nto promote and achieve finality in litigation.  Significantly, statutes of limitations provide potential \ndefendants with certainty that after a set period of time, they will not be ha[iled] into court to \ndefend time-barred claims.  Moreover, limitations periods discourage plaintiffs from sitting on \ntheir rights.  Statutes of limitations are, indeed, fundamental to our judicial system. \n  \n \nCarolina Marine Handling, Inc. v. Lasch, 363 S.C. 169, 175-76, 609 S.E.2d 548, 552 (S.C. Ct. App. 2005) (internal \nquotation marks and citations omitted). The reduction in the magnitude and number of debts that creditors can \nlegally enforce because of the application of the Texas statute of limitations reduces the potential vulnerability to \nimproper financial inducements, and the degree that a debtor is \u201cfinancially overextended,\u201d is also reduced. \nHowever, it does not negate the debtor\u2019s past conduct, which failed to take more aggressive actions to resolve the \nfinancial jeopardy.  \n \n\n \n                                                                                                                      \n \n8\n                                                          \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the \nperson\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected \nmedical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there \nare clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and, \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due \ndebt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to \nsubstantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the \nissue. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not provide a temporal or specific definition of what constitutes \u201crecent\u201d \nconduct. Applicant has five unpaid debts, which were delinquent for significant periods of time.  \nThey are now in a payment plan, and their status is now \u201ccurrent.\u201d He has shown sufficient effort \nand/or unusual circumstances to establish his financial problems are \u201cunlikely to recur.\u201d His \nconduct over the last six or seven months with his creditors removes my doubts about his current \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Based on my evaluation of the record evidence \nas a whole,14 I conclude AG \u00b6 20(a) does apply. \n \nApplicant disclosed sufficient information to support partial application of AG \u00b6 20(b). \nHe went through a bitter divorce in 2004. The record did not disclose any information indicating \nhis actions were in bad faith. However, Applicant\u2019s conduct does not warrant full application of \nAG \u00b6 20(b) because he did not act more aggressively and responsibly to resolve his delinquent \ndebts.15 He has not provided evidence showing he maintained communication with his creditors \nprior to 2007.  \n \nApplicant receives full credit under AG \u00b6 20(c) because he received financial or credit \ncounseling, and he has a payment plan with his creditors. He has been paying his delinquent \ndebts for the past six or seven months. There are \u201cclear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control.\u201d  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) does not fully apply because there is insufficient information to establish that \nApplicant showed good faith in the resolution of his delinquent debts.16 He does, however, \n \n14See ISCR Case No. 03- 02374 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 26, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-22173 at 4 (App. \nBd. May 26, 2004)). When making a recency analysis all debts are considered as a whole. \n   \n15\u201cEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside \nher control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when dealing \nwith those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. \n99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-\n13096 at 4 (App. Bd.

He did not provide \u201cdocumented proof to substantiate the \nbasis of the dispute or [provide] evidence of actions to resolve the issue\u201d with respect to his \ndelinquent debt.  \n \nIn sum, he has demonstrated sufficient effort to resolve financial concerns to merit \napplication of the mitigating conditions described in AGs \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and 20(c).  However, he has \nnot presented sufficient evidence to support application of the other mitigating conditions. \n \nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 15, \u201c[c]onduct involving . . . lack of candor [or] dishonesty . . . can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified \ninformation. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the . . \n. clearance process . . . .\u201d One personal conduct disqualifying conditions is particularly relevant \nand may be disqualifying in this case. AG \u00b6 16(a) provides, \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, \nor falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history \nstatement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award \nfiduciary responsibilities.\u201d   \n \nApplicant gave an incorrect answer to two questions in Section 28 of his 2005 SF 86. \nThe evidence of record, however, establishes his erroneous answer was not a deliberate \nfalsification.18 Section 28 seeks information about all debts delinquent over 180 days for the last \n \n16The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant must \npresent evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-\nfaith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not define the term \u2018good-\nfaith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith \u2018requires a showing that a \nperson acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or \nobligation.\u2019 Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a \nlegally available option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit \nof [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition].  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting ISCR Case \nNo. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \n \n17See ISCR 04-07360 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 26, 2006) (stating partial credit was available under FCMC 6 for \ndebts being resolved through garnishment). See also n. 13, supra. \n \n18The Appeal Board has cogently explained the process for analyzing falsification cases, stating: \n \n(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has the burden of proving \nfalsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove an applicant\u2019s \nintent or state of mind when the omission occurred; and (c) a Judge must consider the record \nevidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial evidence concerning the \n\n \n                                                                                                                      \n \n10\n                                                                                                                                                                                          \nseven years. He was also required to disclose debts currently delinquent over 90 days. I \nconclude, however, that his intent was not to conceal the information about his delinquent debts \nfrom clearance officials.19  He disclosed in the comments that he had financial issues from his \ndivorce and received financial counseling, alerting security officials to the pertinent financial \nissue. He explained that he answered, \u201cYes\u201d on his SF 86 worksheet, and failed to insure his \nanswers were accurately transferred to his electronic SF 86. His explanation is logical, and \nconsistent with the other available facts. I conclude Applicant has refuted the allegation of \ndeliberate falsification.  \n \n \u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis \n \nIn addition to the facts discussed in the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions, \nI have considered each of the factors related to the whole person concept under AG \u00b6 2(a). As \nnoted above, Applicant\u2019s failure to make greater progress resolving his delinquent debts is  \nsufficiently serious to raise a security concern. His actions with respect to financial considerations \nwere knowledgeable and voluntary. Five debts are currently unpaid. He is 52 years old, sufficiently \nmature to be fully responsible for his conduct. Failure to pay his debts is not prudent or \nresponsible. A person \u201cwho is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts \nto generate funds\u201d and as such the potential for pressure and exploitation is raised.  \n \nApplicant presented substantial extenuating and mitigating evidence. His financial \ndifficulties resulted from a bitter divorce. He is paying all delinquent debts using payment plans. \nApplicant received financial counseling. Knowledge from financial counseling will help him \nbudget, set repayment priorities, and avoid future financial problems. Changes in his financial \nhabits will enable construction of a solid financial foundation. The absence of evidence of any \nprior violation of his employer\u2019s rules or requirements, his candid admissions concerning his \ndebts, and his promise to continue his future financial progress weigh in his favor. The likelihood \nof recurrence is low. He is making his payments. His wife has solid, long-term employment and \nmakes about $42,000 per year. Most importantly, their overall financial situation has improved \nwith the increase in family income.   \n \nThis process has made him aware of the necessity to show financial responsibility and to \nensure his debts are not delinquent. \u201cApplicant is now alert to the security concerns presented by \nhis circumstances and the responsibilities incumbent on him as a result.\u201d ISCR Case No. 04-07360 \nat 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 26, 2006). This case has sensitized him to the importance of accurate \ninformation on his SF 86.       \n \n \napplicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the omission occurred. [Moreover], it was legally \npermissible for the Judge to conclude Department Counsel had established a prima facie case \nunder Guideline E and the burden of persuasion had shifted to the applicant to present evidence to \nexplain the omission.   \n \n19 In ISCR Case No. 04-08934 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 17, 2006) the Board stated an applicant\u2019s statements \nabout his or her intent and state of mind when an SF 86 or SF 85P was executed were relevant but not binding \ninformation. Moreover, an applicant\u2019s statements are considered in light of the record evidence of a whole. Id. \u201cThe \nsecurity concerns raised by an applicant\u2019s falsification are not necessarily overcome by applicant\u2019s subsequent \ndisclosures to the government.\u201d See ISCR Case No. 01-19513 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 22, 2004).\u201d Id. \n\n \n                                                                                                                      \n \n11\nIn sum, the likelihood of recurrence is very low because of improvement in Applicant\u2019s \noverall financial situation, and evidence about his efforts to pay his delinquent debt. Evidence of \nrehabilitation is sufficient to resolve my doubts about his reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. His actions establish that he is well on the road to complete financial rehabilitation.  \n \nThe overall record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to his security \neligibility and suitability. I take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d20 and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative Process, and \nmy interpretation of my  responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant has mitigated or \novercome the government\u2019s case. I conclude he is eligible for a security clearance. \n \n \n \nFORMAL FINDINGS \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \n Paragraph 1, Guideline F:    \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.j: \n For Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: FOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a to 2.b: \nFor Applicant  \n \n \nDECISION \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance.

The first was dismissed for failing to file a required confirmation certification and the\nsecond for nonpayment.  She now has eight delinquent debts, including a federal income tax debt\nof $53,189.  She did not disclose a federal tax lien when she executed her security clearance\napplication (SF 86), because she was unaware of it.  She has refuted the allegation of falsifying her\nSF 86, but she has not mitigated the security concerns raised by her financial problems.  Clearance\nis denied.\n\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn November 29, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny Applicant a\nsecurity clearance.  This action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified, Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Jan. 2, 1992),\nas amended and modified (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines approved by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005, and implemented effective September 1, 2006 (Guidelines).  The\nSOR alleged security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline\nE (Personal Conduct).\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on December 22, 2006, and elected to have a hearing\nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on March 28, 2007 and heard on April\n25, 2007, as scheduled.  I kept the record open until May 9, 2007, to enable Applicant to submit\ndocumentary evidence.  I received her evidence on May 9, 2007, and it has been admitted without\nobjection as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through U.  DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.)\non May 14, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant's admissions in her answer to the SOR and at the hearing are incorporated into my\nfindings of fact.  I make the following findings:\nApplicant is a 52-year-old instructional designer for a defense contractor.  She has worked\nfor her current employer since November 2004.  She served for 20 years in the U.S. Navy, retiring\nin February 1994 as a chief petty officer (E-7).  She received a security clearance in February 1974\nand was cleared for sensitive compartmented information in August 1975. She currently holds an\ninterim clearance.  \nApplicant and her husband, also retired from the U.S. Navy, have been married since August\n1977.  They purchased a condominium in the late 1980's while they were both on active duty and\nassigned in the U.S.  After they were reassigned overseas, they had difficulty selling it because of\nlitigation between the homeowners\u2019 association and the developers (Tr. 86).  They found themselves\npaying expenses for two households (Answer at 2).  They also incurred unexpected funeral expenses\nin December 1990 when Applicant\u2019s father-in-law died.  Applicant and her husband filed a Chapter\n13 bankruptcy petition in June 1991 (SOR \u00b6 1.j).  The petition was dismissed in November 1991 for\nfailure to file a required confirmation certification (Government Exhibit (GX) 4). \nApplicant and her husband filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition again in November 1992\n(SOR \u00b6 1.k).  This petition was dismissed in December 1992 after they missed two required\npayments to the bankruptcy trustee (GX 5).  By the time this petition was dismissed, they had paid\napproximately $80,000 to the trustee.  Shortly afterwards, the mortgage on their home was foreclosed\n(Answer at 2).\n\n4\nWhen Applicant was laid off from her job with a federal contractor in October 1999, she used\nher veteran\u2019s benefits to continue her education.  She received a master of education degree in\nAugust 2003 and a master of science in educational leadership and instructional technology in\nJanuary 2004.  \nApplicant testified she and her husband were advised that they could not take a federal\nincome tax deduction for the mortgage interest paid on their home while the Chapter 13 bankruptcy\nwas ongoing.  The source and basis for this advice are not reflected in the record.  As a result, they\nincurred a large federal income tax debt.  According to Applicant, when they finally gathered the\ndocumentation to support a tax deduction, it was too late to claim it.  They spent about $6,000 in\nlegal fees for unsuccessful attempts to settle or compromise the tax debt.  At one time, their attorneys\noffered to settle the debt for about $9,000, but the IRS rejected the offer.  Applicant and her husband\ndecided to negotiate directly with the Internal Revenue Service, and they began a payment plan in\nMarch 2006, providing for monthly payments of $930.  They made five payments.  On April 16,\n2007, they were notified by the IRS that the payment agreement was terminated for nonpayment.\nThey are now awaiting a packet of forms and instructions from the IRS to resubmit an offer of\ncompromise (Tr. 62).  Applicant\u2019s husband testified  he and Applicant share responsibility for family\nfinances, but she takes care paying the household bills and he has taken responsibility for dealing\nwith the insurance companies and the IRS because, in his words, \u201c[T]hat\u2019s my mess and I need to\nget out of it.\u201d (Tr. 85).\nIn August 2004, the IRS placed a tax lien against Applicant\u2019s property for $53,189.  She\nexecuted her SF 86 on November 22, 2004.  She answered \u201cno\u201d to question 36, asking if a lien had\nbeen placed against her property during the past seven years.  She denied intentionally falsifying her\nSF 86, explaining that she was unaware of the lien until late December 2004 or early January 2005,\nwhen she applied for a car loan and discovered the tax lien (Tr. 41).  Applicant\u2019s husband called their\ntax lawyers, who informed them they had tried to have the lien released but were unsuccessful\n(Answer to SOR at 3).\nAfter retiring from the Navy, Applicant\u2019s husband obtained an associate\u2019s degree in forestry.\nHe worked for the state as a forestry technician for about five years, until the state required that\nforesters be able to fight forest fires.  He could not work as a fire fighter because of a respiratory\nailment, and he lost his job in September 2004 (Tr. 72).  After he left his forestry job, he worked in\na home improvement store, but he has been unable to work since December 2006 because of a back\nproblem.  He is scheduled for back surgery in May 2007 (Tr. 56-57, 77-78).  \nApplicant and her husband have owned their current home since August 1997, and they have\nconsiderable equity in the property.  They also own an adjoining lot on which there is no mortgage\ndebt (Tr. 69).  Applicant believes they could sell the adjoining lot or obtain an equity loan and pay\noff the tax debt if the federal tax lien were lifted. (Tr. 65-66).\nApplicant and her husband suffered about $45,000  hurricane damage to their home during\nHurricane Ivan on September 16, 2004.  The hurricane hit about a week after Applicant\u2019s husband\nlost his job.  All but the $4,000 deductible was covered by insurance, but they incurred about\n$10,000 in other out-of-pocket expenses not covered by insurance.  They financed most of their out-\nof-pocket expenses with credit cards (Tr. 84-85).\n\n5\nAt some time in 2005, Applicant and her husband incurred more than $3,000 in emergency\nveterinary expenses to save the life of their dog.  They incurred the credit card debt alleged in SOR\n\u00b6 1.c to pay the bill. \nIn December 2005, Applicant and her son-in-law purchased a \u201chobby car,\u201d a 1983 Excalibur,\nfor about $37,000 (Tr. 58, 67).  They owe about $30,000 on it.  Applicant estimates its current\nmarket value at about $40,000 (Tr. 67).  She makes the monthly payments of $679 on this car (Tr.\n58-59).  Her monthly expenses include about $1,500 for insurance on three cars, including the hobby\ncar (Tr. 59).\nThe evidence concerning the debts alleged in the SOR is summarized in the table below.\nSOR\nDebt\nAmount\nStatus and Dates of Action\nRecord\n1.a\nFederal tax lien for\ntax year 2002\n$53,189\nPaid $930 per month for\nfive months; plan\nterminated 4-16-07 for\nnonpayment; awaiting\nreceipt of application packet\nto resubmit offer of\ncompromise\nAnswer to SOR;\nAX C; Tr. 80-81\n1.b\nCredit card\n$865\nUnpaid\nTr. 48\n1.c\nPet surgery\n$2,306\n$200 payment on 5-8-07\n(after hearing)\nAX B\n1.d\nLoan for new air\nconditioning units\n$5,713\nUnpaid, attempting to\nnegotiate settlement\nAX B; Tr. 49\n1.e\nCredit card\n$945\nPaid in full, but no\ndocumentation\nAX B; Tr. 47-48\n1.f\nCredit card\n$1,064\n$305 payment on 4-19-07\nAX D\n1.g\nCredit card\n$713\nCreditor agreed on 4-28-07\n(after hearing) to accept\n$200 per month\nAX E\n1.h\nGasoline credit\ncard\n$849\nSettlement offer received on\n4-21-07 (after hearing)\nAX F\n1.i\nCredit card\n$1,083\nUnpaid, attempting to\nnegotiate payment plan\nAX B\nApplicant\u2019s military retired pay is about $987 per month, and she receives $339 in veteran\u2019s\ndisability pay (AX H at 3).

Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d  Id. at\n527.  The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants\neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within\nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.  Eligibility for a security clearance is\npredicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria contained in the Guidelines.  Each clearance\ndecision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision based on the relevant and material\nfacts and circumstances, the whole person concept, the disqualifying conditions and mitigating\nconditions under each specific guideline, and the factors listed in the Guidelines \u00b6\u00b6 2(a)(1)-(9).\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the\ngovernment.  The government must be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in persons\nwith access to classified information.  However, the decision to deny an individual a security\nclearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  See Exec. Or. 10865\n\u00a7 7.  It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the\nSecretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.\nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal\nor professional history of the applicant which disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being\neligible for access to classified information.  See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is\n\u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth.,\n36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).  The Guidelines presume a nexus or rational connection between\nproven conduct under any of the criteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.  See\nISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the\nburden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  See Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App.\nBd. Dec. 19, 2002).  \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d  Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see Guidelines \u00b6 2(b). \n\n7\nCONCLUSIONS\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations)\nThe concern under this guideline is as follows:. \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s\nmeans, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment,\nor unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an\nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual\nwho is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\u201d\nGuidelines \u00b618.\nSeveral disqualifying conditions under this guideline could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying in this case.  Guidelines \u00b6 19(a) applies where there is an \u201cinability or unwillingness\nto satisfy debts.\u201d Guidelines \u00b6 19(b) is a two-pronged condition that applies where there is\n\u201cindebtedness caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending and the absence of any evidence of\nwillingness or intent to pay the debt or establish a realistic plan to pay the debt.\u201d  Guidelines \u00b6 19(c)\napplies when there is \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d  Guidelines \u00b6 19(e) applies\nwhen there is \u201cconsistent spending beyond one's means, which may be indicated by excessive\nindebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-to-income ratio, and/or other financial\nanalysis.\u201d  All these disqualifying conditions are raised by the evidence in this case.\nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying conditions in\nGuidelines \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(b), 19(c), and 19(e), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence to\nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant has the burden of\nproving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it is never shifted to the government.\nSee ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nSecurity concerns based on financial problems can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe\nbehavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment.\u201d Guidelines \u00b6 20(a).  Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are numerous, recent, and likely\nto continue.  Her purchase of an expensive \u201chobby car,\u201d and her decision to pay for the car and\ninsurance for her son-in-law did not reflect good judgment in light of her long-standing and\npersistent financial problems.  I conclude this mitigating condition is not established.\nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe conditions\nthat resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d Guidelines \u00b6 20(b).  Both\nprongs, i.e., conditions beyond the person\u2019s control and responsible conduct, must be established.\nApplicant has encountered numerous conditions beyond her control: her inability to sell her\ncondominium because of litigation, her husband\u2019s inability to work, her reduced income because of\nillness, emergency veterinary expenses, and out-of-pocket expenses related to hurricane damage.\nBoth Applicant and her spouse incurred educational expenses, but they were reasonable measures\nat the time because they made themselves more employable.  However, her purchase of the hobby\ncar, her agreement to be solely responsible for the car loan and insurance, and her failure to sell it,\n\n8\neven though it has a market value considerably greater than the loan balance, were not responsible\nacts under the circumstances.  At the hearing, she stated her willingness to sell the car, but she has\noffered no evidence of actions demonstrating that willingness.  Her reduced income because of\nillness and her husband\u2019s loss of employment after his back injury occurred after the debts alleged\nin the SOR were already delinquent.  I conclude this mitigating condition is not established.\nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe person has\nreceived or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem\nis being resolved or is under control.\u201d  Guidelines \u00b6 20(c).  This mitigating condition has two prongs\nthat may be either disjunctive or conjunctive.  It the person has received counseling, it must also be\nshown that there are clear indications the problem is being resolved or under control.  However, if\nthe person has not received counseling, this mitigating condition may still apply if there are clear\nindications that the problem is being resolved or under control.  \nApplicant has not sought or obtained debt counseling.  She and her husband obtained legal\nadvice, but it was limited to the federal tax debt and there are no indications the tax problem is being\nresolved.  They have negotiated a payment plan for the credit card debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g; but\nthey have made no payments, and it is questionable whether they have the funds to carry out the plan.\nThey received a settlement offer for the credit card debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h, but there is no\nevidence that they have accepted the offer or made any payments, and it is questionable whether they\ncan.  I conclude this mitigating condition is not established. \nFinally, security concerns under this guideline can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe\nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d\nGuidelines \u00b6 20(d). The record reflects a good-faith effort to resolve the federal tax lien, but it does\nnot reflect an overall good-faith effort to resolve her financial situation, in part because Applicant\nhas not availed herself of the opportunity to reduce her monthly expenses and generate funds by\nselling the hobby car.  I conclude this mitigating condition is not established.\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct)\nThe concern under this guideline is as follows: \u201cConduct involving questionable judgment,\nlack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Of\nspecial interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance\nprocess or any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\u201d  Guidelines \u00b6 15.  The\nrelevant disqualifying condition in this case is \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of\nrelevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form\nused to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.\u201d\nGuidelines \u00b6 16(a).\nWhen a falsification allegation is controverted, as in this case, the government has the burden\nof proving it.  An omission, standing alone, does not prove an applicant\u2019s state of mind when the\nomission occurred.  An administrative judge must consider the record evidence as a whole to\ndetermine whether there is direct or circumstantial evidence concerning an applicant\u2019s state of mind\n\nThis document is available on the IRS web site, \n1\nwww.irs.gov. \n9\nat the time of the omission.  See ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004) (explaining\nholding in ISCR Case No. 02-23133 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004)).\nThe federal tax lien was filed in August 2004, two months before Applicant executed her SF\n86.  Both she and her husband testified that they were not aware of the tax lien until they inquired\nabout a car loan, a month or two after she executed the SF 86.  In the ordinary course of business,\nthe IRS would have sent Applicant and her husband a copy of the Notice of Federal Tax Lien, as\nrequired by the Internal Revenue Manual, Part 5, Chapter 12, \u00a7 5.12.2.13.   The record does not\n1\nreflect the exact date the lien was filed, nor does it reflect actual receipt of the notice by Applicant.\nApplying the presumption of regularity, however, I have presumed the notice was sent to Applicant\nand her husband as required.  \nWhether Applicant realized that a lien had been filed is a separate factual issue.  She and her\nhusband knew they owed taxes, and they had received many documents from the IRS, which they\ngave to their lawyers.  Applicant relied on her husband to deal with the IRS.  The lien was filed\nduring a chaotic period in Applicant\u2019s life.  It was filed some time in August 2004, Applicant\u2019s\nhusband lost his job in early September, Hurricane Ivan hit their home in mid-September, and\nApplicant filed her SF 86 in November 2004.\nAfter considering the circumstances in which Applicant executed her SF 86, hearing her\ntestimony and her husband\u2019s testimony, and observing their demeanor at the hearing, I found\nApplicant\u2019s testimony plausible and credible.  I am satisfied she did not realize a lien had been filed.\nTherefore, I conclude she did not intentionally falsify her SF 86.  No disqualifying conditions under\nthis guideline are raised.\nWhole Person Analysis\nIn addition to considering the specific disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each\nguideline, I have also considered: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency\nand recency of the conduct; (4) the applicant\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the\nextent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  Guidelines\n\u00b6\u00b6 2(a)(1)-(9).  Several of these factors are discussed above, but some merit additional comment.\nApplicant and her husband have given many years of dedicated service to the U.S.  She held\na clearance for many years, apparently without incident.  Her loyalty, honesty, and sincerity are not\nat issue.  However, unless and until she can resolve the federal tax problem, she will remain\nfinancially overextended and vulnerable to pressure.  She has encountered numerous obstacles to\nrestoring their financial health.  However, she also has made some unwise financial decisions, such\nas the \u201chobby car\u201d purchase.  \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating\nall the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the\n\n10\nsecurity concerns raised by her financial problems.  Accordingly, I conclude she has not carried her\nburden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant her a security\nclearance.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.

On May 11, 2007, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On November 30, 2007, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Darlene Lokey\nAnderson granted Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. Department Counsel filed a timely\nappeal pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nDepartment Counsel raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in her\napplication of the Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FCMC); and whether the Judge\u2019s\nfavorable security clearance decision was arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law.  Finding error,\nwe reverse.  \nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Factual Findings\nA.  Facts\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant works as a security guard\nfor a defense contractor.  He is retired from the United States Air Force and from a subsequent career\nwith the Post Office.  He is delinquent in tax payments to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in the\namount of $41,254 (including interest and penalties) for tax years 1995 and 1997 through 2005.  He\nhas entered into an arrangement with the IRS to pay back this debt in monthly installments.  A\nfederal tax lien filed in 1995 for back taxes has been paid.  Additionally, a debt to the California\nFranchise Tax Board for $2,721.21 for delinquent taxes, interest, and penalties for 2002, 2004, and\n2005 was paid off through wage garnishment.\nApplicant had five medical bills which had been placed into collection and which were\noutstanding at the time of the hearing.  He also owed $4,592 following voluntary repossession of a\ncar, regarding which Applicant stated at the hearing that he intended to contact the creditor and\nresolve the debt.  Applicant had two bank debts on his credit report\u2013$1,212 and $32\nrespectively\u2013which he denied owing.  He started working with a credit counselor in the past, but\n\u201cbecame leery when the payments he was making to them were not being credited toward his debts\nand the . . . [counselor\u2019s] address kept changing.\u201d   \n1\n\u201cIn an effort to pay off his past due debts, the Applicant put his house up for sale. \nApparently, the buyer breached the purchase agreement, committing possible fraud against the\nApplicant.  The Applicant explained that he agreed to sell the house to the buyer assuming the buyer\nwould get a new loan in his name. The buyer never got the loan, but the title of the house was\ntransferred to the buyer.  The buyer allowed the Applicant to live in the house under the agreement\nthat the Applicant pay him $1,000.00 a month for rent.  To prevent foreclosure, the Applicant who\nstill remains responsible for the mortgage, is paying the note and the property taxes on the house,\n\nId. at 3.\n2\n3\nas well as paying the buyer $1,000.00 a month to live there.  The buyer, who now has legal title to\nthe house, has not paid the Applicant anything and refuses to comply with the purchase agreement.\nThe Applicant is planning to hire a real estate attorney to pursue the matter further.\u201d2\nB.  Discussion\nThe Appeal Board\u2019s review of the Judge\u2019s findings of facts is limited to determining if they\nare supported by substantial evidence\u2013\u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept\nas adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  Directive\n\u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing\ntwo inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency\u2019s finding\nfrom being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S.\n607, 620-21 (1966).  In evaluating the Judge\u2019s findings, we are required to give deference to the\nJudge\u2019s credibility determinations.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1. \nDepartment Counsel contends that the Judge failed to consider significant contrary record\nevidence.   The Board will address this in its discussion of the issues raised on appeal.\nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Ultimate Conclusions\n A Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation\nfor\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choices made.\u2019\u201d\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43\n(1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  \u201cThe\ngeneral standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests\nof the national security.\u2019\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  The Appeal\nBoard may reverse the Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or revoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.32.3 and E3.1.33.3.  \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong\npresumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.  See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913\nF. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  After the government presents\nth\nevidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to establish any appropriate\nmitigating conditions.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  \u201cThe application of disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions and whole person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply\nto the particular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires the exercise of sound discretion\nin light of the record evidence as a whole.\u201d  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-03635 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec.\n20, 2006).\nIn deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, the Board\nwill review the Judge's decision to determine whether:  it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails\n\nDirective \u00b6 E2.18.  \n3\nDirective \u00b6 E2.20(b).  \n4\nApplicant asserts that Department Counsel arguments on appeal raise new issues with regard to his delinquent\n5\ntax debts.  A review of the SOR and the Judge\u2019s decision indicates that Applicant\u2019s assertion is not valid.  \n\u201cQ: Okay.  So are you having taxes withheld from your retirement pay?  A: No, ma\u2019am.  Not from the Air\n6\nForce.  Q: Why not?  A: I should, but I haven\u2019t.\u201d  Tr. at 40.  \n4\nto articulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of\njudgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision\nthat runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere\ndifference of opinion.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law,\nthe Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of Executive Order 10865, the\nDirective, or other applicable federal law.  See ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2,\n2006).\nFinancial problems can raise a security concern insofar as \u201c[f]ailure to live within one\u2019s\nmeans, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment,\nor unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.\u201d    In this case\n3\nthe Judge properly found that the delinquent debts alleged in the SOR raised security concerns under\nGuideline F, thereby placing upon Applicant the burden of persuasion as to mitigation.\nDepartment Counsel argues that the Judge\u2019s application of the relevant mitigating conditions\nwas unsupported by the record evidence and did not take into account contrary record evidence.  The\nBoard finds Department Counsel\u2019s argument persuasive.  For example, the Judge concluded that\nApplicant had established his case under FCMC 20(b), which mitigates Guideline F security\nconcerns when \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the\npersons\u2019s control . . .and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d    However,\n4\nDepartment Counsel points to evidence that impugns the view that Applicant\u2019s problems resulted\nfrom causes outside his control, for example that Applicant\u2019s tax delinquencies were to a large extent\ncaused by his failure to have sufficient amounts withheld from his pay.  Common sense would\nsuggest that such a failure was, by its nature, within Applicant\u2019s control, and there is nothing in the\nrecord evidence to demonstrate otherwise.  Even more to the point, Department Counsel cites to\nsignificant record evidence inconsistent with a conclusion that Applicant has demonstrated\nresponsible behavior in relation to his financial problems.   For example, as of the hearing he still\n5\nhad not ensured that sufficient taxes were being withheld from his Air Force retired pay.6\nFurthermore, he has other significant debt for which he had not, at the time of the hearing, made\n\nApplicant was questioned as to his efforts to address the debt arising out of the repossession of his car.  \u201cQ:\n7\nSo, what are you going to do?  A: I will probably have to contact them and talk to them about it.\u201d  Tr. at 63.  Concerning\na debt of $1,881 to a bank, Applicant was asked, \u201cDo you intend to contact the Credit Reporting Agency to figure out\nthe status . . . of that?  A: I think probably I have to contact the [bank] first, wouldn\u2019t I?  Q: Do you intend to do that?\nA: Yes, ma\u2019am.\u201d  Tr. at 66.  See ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999.) (\u201cPromises to take action in the\nfuture . . . are not a substitute for a documented track record of remedial action.\u201d)    \nTr. at  56-60.   These are the two bank debts referenced in the findings section above.\n8\nDirective \u00b6 E2.20(c).  \n9\nThere is no requirement that  financial counseling be formal or paid for.  Free and informal advice can supply\n10\na basis for mitigating Guideline F security concerns.  See ISCR Case No. 99-0296 at 2 (App. Bd. Apr. 18, 2000.) \nTr. at 67 - 68.  \n11\nDirective \u00b6 E2.20(d).  \n12\nSee ISCR Case No. 06-14521 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 15, 2007).  \n13\n5\nreasonable efforts to pay off.   He entered into an agreement to pay off his debt to the IRS only after\n7\nthe close of the hearing.  Additionally, his claim to have a zero balance on two credit card debts is\nnot supported by corroborating evidence.   All in all, the record evidence does not support a\n8\nconclusion that Applicant has demonstrated the reasonable behavior contemplated by this mitigating\ncondition.       \nDepartment Counsel also takes issue with the Judge\u2019s treatment of FCMC 20(c): \u201cthe person\nhas received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the\nproblem is being resolved or is under control.\u201d   The Judge\u2019s own findings raise serious questions\n9\nabout the competence and reliability of the financial counselor whom Applicant testified he had\nemployed.  Certainly, to receive credit under this aspect of the mitigating condition, it is not enough\nmerely to speak with a person who claims the title of financial counselor.  Rather, an applicant must\nshow that he has in good faith engaged the services of someone who is actually able to provide\nbeneficial advice.   In this case the Judge\u2019s finding, and the record evidence upon which it is based,\n10\nsuggests that Applicant hired a counselor who had his own difficulties with reliability.    In any\n11\nevent, for reasons set forth above, there is little record evidence to show that Applicant has taken\ncontrol of his financial problems.  Neither does the evidence support a conclusion that Applicant has\n\u201cinitiated a good faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts . . .\u201d   In this\n12\ncontext, the term \u201cgood faith\u201d means that an applicant\u2019s conduct with regard to his financial situation\nshows, among other things, reasonableness and prudence.   Much of the evidence already cited\n13\nabove seriously compromises Applicant\u2019s efforts to demonstrate that he has acted in good faith to\nresolve his delinquent debts.  His failure to withhold sufficient taxes, his failure to make timely\nefforts at entering into an agreement with the IRS, his failure to contact creditors and to supply\ncorroboration for his claims that certain of his debts had been repaid all provide serious grounds to\nquestion the reasonableness of Applicant\u2019s conduct.  In addition, his testimony as to his arrangement\n\n\u201cQ: . . . When you entered into this agreement with him, were you also a tenant at the house with him at the\n14\ntime?  A: No.  No.  Q: Okay.  So, you moved out?  A: No, I haven\u2019t moved out.  Q: You never moved out?  A: Never\nmoved out.  Q: You never gave him possession of the house?  A: Never . . . I still live in the house with my son.  Q:  You\njust signed an agreement that said he would get a new loan and that you would sell him the house for $200.000?  A: Yes.\n. . .And he had to get his own mortgage.  Q: Right.  Now, you said you were giving him $1,000 a month?  A:  Because\nI figured \u2013 he wouldn\u2019t let me out of the \u2013 when I signed the paper, it was like the paperwork for . . . the title.  And he\nwent and registered it.  Q: Okay.  So, you signed over the house to him?  A: Uh-huh.  So, as far as I was concerned, he\nwas the owner of the house.  And he was getting his mortgage.  So, I was paying him $1,000 a month . . . Q: Why would\nyou sign over a house to someone without getting the money for it?  A: Like I said, I thought he knew what he was doing.\n. . . Q: And you\u2019ve never given him possession because of the fact that he hasn\u2019t paid for it?  A: Right.  And the mortgage\nis in my name.  I notified [mortgage company] and they said well it\u2019s still in your name\u2013the mortgage\u2013so you have to\nmake the payments.\u201d  Tr. at 70 - 74.  \n6\nwith the buyer of his home further undercuts his efforts to demonstrate sufficient judgment and\nreliability to be entrusted with classified information.14\nGiving due consideration to the matters which Applicant has presented in his behalf, the\nBoard nevertheless concludes that Department Counsel has made a persuasive case that the Judge\u2019s\nfavorable decision is not sustainable on this record, either under the mitigating conditions which the\nJudge cited or through the whole-person analysis.  Accordingly, the Judge\u2019s favorable security\nclearance decision is arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law.\nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s favorable security clearance decision is REVERSED.\nSigned: Michael Y.

He has\naddressed almost all of his debts by setting up payment plans and making regular monthly payments\ntoward the debts.  The one debt he has not addressed, he will set up a payment plan and start making\npayments soon.  He has made a good faith effort to resolve his indebtedness, and there is evidence\nof financial rehabilitation.  Clearance is granted.\n\n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn March 30, 2007, and May 11, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n(DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6\n(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, (as amended) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the\nApplicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding\nunder the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for the Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to\ndetermine whether clearance should be denied or revoked.\nThe Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on June 18, 2007, and requested a hearing\nbefore a DOHA Administrative Judge.  This case was assigned to the undersigned on October 9,\n2007.  A notice of hearing was issued on October 16, 2007, scheduling the hearing for November\n1, 2007.  At the hearing the Government presented nine exhibits, referred to as Government Exhibits\n1 through 9.  The Applicant presented two exhibits, referred to as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A and B.  The\nApplicant also testified on his own behalf.  The record remained open until November 15, 2007, to\nallow the Applicant to submit additional supporting documentation.  He submitted two Post-Hearing\nExhibits, referred to as Post-Hearing Exhibits A and B.  The official transcript (Tr.) was received on\nNovember 13, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe Applicant is 65 years old and has a high school diploma and almost two years of college.\nHe is employed by a defense contractor as a Security Guard and is seeking to obtain a security\nclearance in connection with his employment.\nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the basis of\nallegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The following findings of fact are entered\nas to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR:\nParagraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations)  The Government alleges that the Applicant\nis ineligible for clearance because he is financially overextended and at risk to engage in illegal acts\nto generate funds. \nThe Applicant retired from the United States Air Force in 1980 as a Master Sargent (E-7),\nand retired from the United States Post Office in 2004 as a government civilian employee.  He is\nreceiving retirement pensions from the Air Force, (which includes a VA disability check) as well as\na pension check from the United States Post Office.  After some confusion as to whether he should\nor should not withhold income taxes from his pension checks, for tax years 1995, and 1997 through\n2004, he did not have taxes withheld from his Air Force retirement pay.  This caused financial\nproblems since, as a result, he became indebted to both the state and federal taxing authorities for\nback taxes.  He is currently indebted for back taxes in the amount of at least $40,000.  He also fell\nbehind on several other bills during and after his divorce.  \n\n3\nIn an effort to pay off his past due debts, the Applicant put his house up for sale.  Apparently,\nthe buyer breached the purchase agreement, committing possible fraud against the Applicant.  The\nApplicant explained that he agreed to sell the house to the buyer assuming the buyer would get a new\nloan in his name. The buyer never got the loan, but the title of the house was transferred to the buyer.\nThe buyer allowed the Applicant to live in the house under the agreement that the Applicant pay him\n$1,000.00 a month for rent.  To prevent foreclosure, the Applicant who still remains responsible for\nthe mortgage, is paying the note and the property taxes on the house, as well as paying the buyer\n$1,000.00 a month to live there.  The buyer, who now has legal title to the house, has not paid the\nApplicant anything and refuses to comply with the purchase agreement.  The Applicant is planning\nto hire a real estate attorney to pursue the matter further.  In the mean time, he has made\narrangements with most of his creditors to pay his delinquent debts.  \nHe admits all of the debts listed in the SOR, except allegations 1(h),1(i),1(j), and 1(k), which\nare those debts that he is disputing.  Credits reports of the Applicant reflect that he owes each of the\ndebts listed in the SOR.  (See Government Exhibits 3,4, 5 and 9). \nDelinquent back taxes owed to the Internal Revenue Service in the amount of $41,254.00\nincluding interest and penalties for tax years 1995, and 1997 through 2005 are currently being paid\nin the amount of $413.00 monthly by money order that the Applicant is mailing.  This payment\narrangement was approved by the IRS.  (Tr. p. 36 and Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibits A and B).\nA federal tax lien was entered against the Applicant in December 2004, in the amount of $21,251.00.\nThere is no evidence in the record to show that this lien has been released.  (See Government Exhibit\n8).   \nA federal tax lien filed in September 1995 for back taxes owed in the amount of $14,889.00\nhas been paid and was released in 1999.  (See Government Exhibit 6). \nA debt owed to the California Franchise Tax Board in the amount of $2,721.21 for delinquent\ntaxes, interest and penalties for tax years 2002, 2004 and 2005 has been paid in full through a\ngarnishment and is no longer owing.  (Tr. p. 47 and Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit B).\n  \nFive medical bills totaling approximately $949.00 that have been placed into collection are\nstill outstanding.  The Applicant explained that all but $200.00 of this debt was incurred by his ex-\nwife after he was divorced from her and she was remarried.  He does not know why she used his\nname.  (Tr. p. 50).  The Applicant explained that his health insurance should have paid the bill but\nthe hospital did not properly contact them for payment.  He has Mail Handlers Medical Benefit Plan,\nthe military Tricare Insurance coverage and Medicare.  In the event that his insurance plans do not\npay the $200.00 debt, he will pay it before the end of the year.  (See Tr. p. 54 and Applicant\u2019s Post-\nHearing Exhibit B).    \nThe Applicant is disputing a debt owed to a bank in the amount of $1,212.00.  He stated that\nhe initially used the card, paid off the balance, and tore it up as he no longer wanted the credit card.\nHe does not believe that he owes the debt and will contact the credit agencies concerning the dispute.\n \n\n4\nA debt owed to another bank in the amount of $32.00  was placed into collection, however,\nthe Applicant learned after contacting the creditor that there is no balance on the account.  \nThe Applicant plans to contact the creditor and set up a payment plan in regards to a debt\nowed to SST/AIB in the amount of $4,592.00 for an account charged off following voluntary\nrepossession of his vehicle.     \nA debt owed to HSBC NV in the amount of $241.00 has been charged off.  The Applicant\nbelieves that he paid off the debt in 2002/2003.  \nThe Applicant is current with all of his monthly bills.  (Tr. p. 66).  He started working with\na credit counselor, but became leery when the payments he was making to them were not being\ncredited towards his debts and the consumer credit counselors\u2019 address kept changing.  (Tr. p. 67).\n    \nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies divided into \"Disqualifying\nFactors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying Factors and Mitigating Factors are\nfound to be applicable in this case:\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations)\n18.  The Concern.  Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial\nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and\nregulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and\nability to protect classified information.  An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of\nhaving to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n19(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; \n19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligation; \nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s\ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death,\ndivorce or separation), and the individual has acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n\n5\n20(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear\nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control;\n20(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise\nresolve debts.\n \nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in evaluating the\nrelevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should consider the following general\nfactors:\n a.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances\nb.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation\nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne.  The voluntariness of participation\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes\ng.  The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\n \ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics and\nconduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question, posed in Section 2 of Executive Order\n10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request\nfor access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period\nof a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is an acceptable security risk.\nEligibility for access to classified information is predicted upon the individual meeting these\npersonnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number of\nvariables known as the whole person concept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past\nand present, favorable and unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The\nAdministrative Judge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence\nwhich is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in\nExecutive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms\n\n6\nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the Applicant\nconcerned.\u201d\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian\nworkers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information twenty-four hours per\nday, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore appropriately concerned when available\ninformation indicates that an Applicant for clearance may be involved in instances of financial\nirresponsibility which demonstrates poor judgment or unreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding\nof a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the holding of a security\nclearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward\nwith evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the\nGovernment\u2019s case.  The Applicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant his a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the Applicant has been\nfinancially irresponsible (Guideline F).  This evidence indicates poor judgment, unreliability and\nuntrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.  Because of the scope and nature of the Applicant's\nconduct, I conclude there is a nexus or connection with his security clearance eligibility.\nConsidering all of the evidence, the Applicant has introduced persuasive evidence in rebuttal,\nexplanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the Government's case.  With respect to his\nfinances, the Applicant\u2019s poor financial history was primarily caused by his failure to withhold the\nproper taxes from his retirement pensions and his divorce and its related problems.  In addition, his\nefforts to sell his house have only caused more financial difficulties for him.  At the present time he\nhas approximately $50,000 in delinquent debt.  However, he has addressed these debts by setting up\npayment plans and making regular monthly payments toward the debts.  The one debt that he has not\npaid, he plans to pay soon.  Under the circumstances, he has made a good faith effort to resolve his\nindebtedness, and there is evidence of financial rehabilitation.  The Applicant has demonstrated that\nhe can properly handle his financial affairs.  \nIn the event that the Applicant does not continue to pay his taxes and arrange for the proper\ntax withholdings in order to avoid future financial problems, and if he does not pay off his other\ndebts accordingly, his security clearance will once again be in immediate jeopardy.  Under Guideline\nF (Financial Considerations), Disqualifying Conditions 19(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy\ndebts; 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligation; 19(e) consistent spending beyond one\u2019s\nmeans, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-\nto-income ration, and/or other financial analysis apply.  Mitigating Conditions 20(b) the conditions\nthat resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of\n\n7\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual has acted responsibly under the circumstances, 20(c) the person has\nreceived or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the\nproblem is being resolved or is under control and 20(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort\nto repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts also apply.  Accordingly, I find for the\nApplicant under Guideline F (Financial Considerations).  \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has overcome the Government's case opposing\nhis request for a  security clearance.  Accordingly, the evidence supports a finding for the Applicant\nas to the factual and conclusionary allegations expressed in Paragraph 1 for the Government's\nStatement of Reasons.  \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as required by\nParagraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1 For the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.b:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.c:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.d:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.e:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.f:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.g:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.h:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.i:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.j:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.k:\nFor the Applicant.\n   \n   \nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.\n  Darlene Lokey Anderson\n\n8\nAdministrative Judge\n",

He was convicted of driving while intoxicated in 2002 and again in 2007. He\nwas also convicted of reckless driving in 2000. He was arrested for assault in 2001, but the charges\nwere dismissed when the victim failed to show at court. Applicant received approximately 19\nmoving traffic violations from August 2000 to December 2004. Applicant failed to mitigate the\nsecurity concerns raised under Guideline G, alcohol consumption, and Guideline J, criminal conduct.\nClearance is denied.\n\nExec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960) as amended and\n1\nmodified.\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n2\n(Jan. 2, 1992), as amended and modified.\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for Applicant. On December 28, 2006, under the applicable Executive Order  and\n1\nDepartment of Defense Directive,  DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR), detailing the basis\n2\nfor its decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline G, (alcohol consumption) and Guideline\nJ (criminal conduct) of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines issued on December 29, 2005, and\nimplemented by the Department of Defense effective September 1, 2006. The revised guidelines\nwere provided to Applicant when the SOR was issued. Applicant answered the SOR in writing on\nFebruary 10, 2007, and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge. In his Answer,\nApplicant admitted all of the allegations under Guidelines G and J. The case was assigned to me on\nMarch 7, 2007. A notice of hearing was issued on March 23, 2007, scheduling the hearing for April\n18, 2007. \nI conducted the hearing as scheduled to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance. The Government offered four exhibits for\nadmission in the record, marked as Government Exhibits (GE) GE 1-4. The exhibits were admitted\ninto evidence without objections. Applicant testified on his own behalf, called one witness, and\noffered two exhibits for admission into the record. They were marked as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits AE\nA-B and were admitted into evidence without objections. Applicant requested the record remain\nopen to allow additional documents to be submitted and until the disposition of pending charges\nagainst him were adjudicated on May 1, 2007. I granted the request and held the record open until\nMay 4, 2007. Additional documents were timely received and marked as AE C-E. Department\nCounsel had no objections and they were admitted into the record. On May 3, 2007, Applicant\nrequested another delay to have the record remain open until May 15, 2007, because his trial date\nwas continued until May 15, 2007. Department Counsel did not object. I granted the request. On\nMay 21, 2007, I received a letter from Applicant\u2019s Counsel with the results of his trial, which are\nincluded in the findings of fact. The letter and its attachments are marked as AE F. Department\nCounsel had no objections, but submitted a letter in response to AE F and it is marked as Hearing\nExhibit I. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on April 27, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the allegations in the SOR are incorporated herein. In addition,\nafter a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following\nfindings of fact:\nApplicant is 35 years old and has worked as a tactical software engineer for a defense\ncontractor since December 1996. He is a college graduate with a degree in electrical engineering and\n\nGE 1 at 10.\n3\nTr. 42-43.\n4\nTr. 28.\n5\nId.\n6\nTr. 29.\n7\nId.\n8\nTr. 69-70.\n9\nTr. 73-74.\n10\nTr. 78.\n11\nTr. 80-81.\n12\n4\nis pursing a master\u2019s in business administration. He estimated it would be completed in May 2007.3\nHe is considered the resident expert in a specialized area in his field.  He was responsible for\n4\nproviding security education to employees of his company detailing their responsibilities in the area\nof security.  This included educating them on reporting adverse information and security violations\n5\namong other things.  He was designated by his company a \u201csecurity champion,\u201d which is an on-site\n6\nadvisor to employees regarding security questions and an extension of the security department.  He\n7\nwas awarded \u201csecurity champion\u201d of the year 2006.8\nOn November 5, 2000, Applicant was arrested and charged with reckless driving. He was\nfound guilty and sentenced to deferred adjudication. He received six months supervised probation,\ncommunity service and a fine. He was observed driving at a high rate of speed. He admitted he was\ndriving in excess of 80 miles per hour (mph)(the speed limit was 65 mph). An officer attempting to\ncatch him reported his speed in excess of 100 mph. Applicant disputes this, but does acknowledge\nthat perhaps the officer had to drive that speed to catch him.  He denies and disputes he was\n9\ntailgating cars, passing them and then cutting them off, as was reported. His explanation for his\ndriving was that he had to go to the bathroom and did not like using public restrooms.10\nIn February 2001, Applicant was arrested and charged with assault. He and his girlfriend\nwere at a local lounge with some friends. They began to argue over her being overly friendly with\nanother man she previously had dated. They left the lounge and continued to argue. A security guard\nintervened to determine if there was a problem. Applicant stated: \u201cI didn\u2019t directly make contact with\nhim. I was trying to get to my door and he decided to file an assault charge.\u201d  Applicant was\n11\ninterviewed on March 29, 2006, and the report indicated that he stated that he told the security guard\nto move, and when he didn\u2019t, Applicant pushed him out of the way so he could get into his car and\nleave. Applicant disputes that he told the investigator that he pushed the security guard. He stated\nthat he told the investigator: \u201cthat I was trying to get to my door and in effect, you know, did, you\nknow, involuntarily or indirectly pushed him out of the way. I am not saying that I directly pushed\nhim so that I could get to my door.\u201d  Applicant further explained that he used his body to try to get\n12\n\nId.\n13\nTr. 59.\n14\nTr. 62. \n15\nTr. 48-49.\n16\nId.\n17\nTr. 47.\n18\n5\nto the car door.  Applicant was arrested and the case was dismissed when the victim failed to show\n13\nfor the hearing. \nApplicant was arrested on October 12, 2002, for driving while intoxicated (DWI). He pled\nguilty to the charge. He served three days in jail and paid a fine. He was stopped for a traffic\ninfraction by a police officer. He took a field sobriety test, failed and was arrested. When asked by\nDepartment Counsel if he had been drinking prior to the arrest he stated: \u201cI might have had one beer\nor some. I don\u2019t recall, it\u2019s quite awhile. But nothing excessive at all.\u201d  Applicant refused to take\n14\na Breathalyzer because \u201cI knew it was my right, so I did.\u201d  Applicant was represented by an\n15\nattorney. His driver\u2019s license was suspended. He explained the reason he pled guilty to the offense\nwas because it was simpler than going to trial. There would be no probation or attendance\nrequirement at Alcoholics Anonymous and \u201cit just seemed a lot easier.\u201d  He stated at his hearing\n16\nthat he did not understand the consequences of actually pleading guilty at this point.17\nFrom August 2000 to December 2004, Applicant received approximately 19 moving traffic\nviolations. In 14 of the cases he was found guilty and assessed a fine. Six of those cases involved\nfines greater than $150. Five of the 19 tickets charged were dismissed in court. \nApplicant stated that his work involved transporting classified data from one site to another.\nMany times he was responsible for physically transporting the data by vehicle to a site sometimes\nas far as 120 miles away. Applicant stated: \nThere was always a time constraint or somebody needed it, you know. ASAP and it,\nyou know, trying to be safe and still get the data there. I mean, I was always just had\nthe customer in mind and making sure that the data got there in a timely fashion. That\nwas my main priority and it led to a lot of my success in being able to run those\nmissions, you know, successfully and being able to deliver the data in a timely\nmanner.  \n18\nApplicant further stated that some of the speeding tickets he received were when he was transporting\ndata and trying to meet a deadline. \nRegarding other speeding tickets, Applicant stated:\nWell, I made the decision to get my MBA and, you know, [Place A] is in the middle\nof nowhere, you know. So I was taking classes at [College B]. I started the program\n\nTr. 47.\n19\nId.\n20\nTr. 48. \n21\nTr.52.\n22\nTr. 55.\n23\n6\nI think in 2001. And the postgraduate, the professors, I mean, still, you know, they\nhad their attendance requirements. I was under difficult time constraints to make it\nto my classes based on where I was on the range.  \n19\nHe elaborated further: \u201cI\u2019m not excusing it at all. I\u2019m just saying I was trying to do\u2013to meet all my\nobligations and, you know, to please everybody as far as, you know professors and being there on\ntime and not miss class.\u201d  Some of the tickets were received when Applicant was attempting to get\n20\nto class on time.\nApplicant stated other tickets were received when he was required to debrief a mission and\na quick assessment was needed. He was required to return to the site quickly, so he speeded and\nreceived a ticket.21\nIn about November 2005, Applicant was arrested and charged with DWI and resisting arrest.\nAt a later date the judge ordered Applicant to comply with certain requirements as part of his release.\nApplicant failed to comply with the judge\u2019s order and was detained and confined. He was escorted\nfrom jail to his hearing by sheriff\u2019s deputies with permission from the criminal court judge.\nApplicant stated: \nCurrently I\u2019m taking a full schedule of graduate classes and I\u2019m taking a Dale\nCarnegie class that runs for 12 weeks on Mondays. I mean these are all four hour\nclasses roughly. So basically I have school on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and\nSaturday mornings. That leaves me pretty much Thursday and Friday to get a lot of\nmy work done at the office where I can spend extra time to do that. But the demands\non turning in homework and doing the studying have kind of\u2013have been a hardship\nwith all the other demands having to do with getting Antabuse in a timely manner.\nI did manage to get the Interlock on my car-I have the Interlock on my car right now.\nThe Antabuse is just waiting the results of my blood work. And I\u2019m also I have an\nitinerary or a schedule for the AA meetings which I still need to attend.  \n22\nApplicant was ordered on March 20, 2006, by the judge to complete the requirements of his release.\nHe did not accomplish what was ordered. He stated: \u201cI was trying to do the best and I believe my\npriorities, you know, were not\u2013everything should have been second and I think everything the judge\nordered should have come first. Otherwise, I wouldn\u2019t have found myself here at this.\u201d23\nRegarding the circumstances of the November 2, 2005, DWI arrest Applicant testified that\nhe was having dinner at his friends house. He acknowledged he did drink alcohol that night, stating\nhe had one beer at 7:30 p.m. and another with dinner around 8:00 p.m. He left to return home\n\nTr. 90.\n24\nTr. 91.\n25\nTr. 91.\n26\nTr. 92.\n27\nTr. 93.\n28\nTr. 121.\n29\nTr. 93.\n30\nTr. 96.\n31\nAE F.\n32\n7\napproximately 11:00 p.m.  He stopped at a red light in the city and fell asleep. He stated: \u201c[t]he next\n24\nthing I remember from that point was being woken up by the EMS who arrived on the scene.\u201d  He\n25\nstated he did not fall asleep due to alcohol consumption and he was not intoxicated. He stated that\nwas going to be his defense at his upcoming trial.  Applicant admitted that while at the red light and\n26\nduring the time he was asleep the car was in gear and his foot was on the brake.  There were no\n27\nsensors on the red light and it remained red for at least two minutes.  He stated he could not have\n28\nbeen asleep for more than ten minutes and it could have been less, but he was certain it was not a\nhalf hour or an hour.  The police arrived and requested Applicant take a field sobriety test. He\n29\nrefused stating he had a bad knee.  He also refused to take a Breathalyzer or blood test. He stated\n30\nhe refused the Breathalyzer because he did not trust the instrument and he could not remember being\nasked to take a blood test.\nApplicant refused to exit the car and was forcibly removed by police. He disputes that he\nrefused. He stated: \nThey didn\u2019t ask me to get out of the car. Had they asked me to get out of the car to\narrest me. I would have obliged them and said okay, and you know, do you what you\nneed to do. I don\u2019t know if there was confusion or misunderstanding, you know, in\nwhat they were asking me or what I was saying, but the next thing I knew was that\nI was on the ground . . .  \n31\nHe was charged with both DWI and resisting arrest. \nOn May 15, 2007, Applicant\u2019s case was adjudicated. The documents provided to me from\nboth his criminal defense attorney and his attorney for his security clearance states that Applicant\npled guilty to the DWI charge and the resisting arrest charge was dismissed.  It also states that\n32\nApplicant accepted responsibility for driving while intoxicated. This contradicts his sworn testimony\ngiven at his hearing. Presumably as part of his plea agreement, his DWI charge was reduced to a first\ntime offense. He was placed on two years community supervision with the following conditions: (a)\nmaintain a \u201cdeep lung interlock\u201d ignition system in his vehicle; (b) screen for antabuse with a\n\nId.\n33\nTr. 101-103.\n34\nConduct not alleged in the SOR may be considered: \u201c(a) to assess an applicant\u2019s credibility; (b) to evaluate\n35\nan applicant\u2019s evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether an applicant has\ndemonstrated successful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines is\napplicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person analysis under Directive Section 6.3.\u201d ISCR Case No. 03-20327\nat 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) (citations omitted). Additionally, the Appeal Board has determined that even though crucial\nsecurity concerns are not alleged in the SOR, the Judge may consider those security concerns when they are relevant and\nfactually related to a disqualifying condition that was alleged in the SOR. ISCR 05-01820 at 3 n.4 (App. Bd. Dec. 14,\n2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-18860 at 8 (App. Bd. Mar. 17, 2003) and ISCR Case No. 02-00305 at 4 (App. Bd.

In response to Question 23c that asked if he\ncurrently had any criminal charges pending against him, he responded \u201cNo.\u201d He testified that he\nfailed to list his pending charges because he had been advised by his criminal defense attorney that\nthere was a legal definition for the term \u201cpending\u201d and he did not have to list this offense.  He did\n34\nnot seek advice from a security expert, nor did he use his background and education in the security\narena to answer the question. Applicant\u2019s testimony was not credible, lacked candor and was not\nbelievable. He also did not list any of his tickets that exceeded a fine of $150, as was required under\nQuestion 23f. I did not consider the omissions made by Applicant on his SCA for disqualifying\npurposes. However, I did consider this testimony along with all of his other testimony in making a\ncredibility determination.  Based on all of his testimony and responses I find a pattern of\n35\nevasiveness and dishonesty based on all of his testimony. Applicant lacked candor and was not\ncredible in his testimony. \nA statement provided by the security manager for Applicant\u2019s employer believes Applicant\nto be of excellent character, trustworthy, honest and extremely dedicated to his position and the\nmission.  He further stated he believed Applicant\u2019s integrity is beyond reproach.\n36\n37\nApplicant\u2019s coworker and girlfriend believes him to be honest, considerate and supportive.\nHe is a great listener, a caring and loving person, and ambitious. He is considered an excellent\nworker. He has assisted the security team in preparing for their annual review and has educated\nemployees on their security responsibilities. He has a good work ethic, energy and creativeness.38\n\nAE C.\n39\nAE D and E.\n40\nDepartment of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).\n41\nId. at 527.\n42\nExec.

He has been outstanding in a challenging role he has played in the engineering\ndepartment. He is considered highly focused and sets the example for others.39\nI considered Applicant\u2019s performance reviews, the ratings, and comments, along with school\ntranscripts that were provided.40\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  As Commander in Chief, the President has\n41\n\u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine\nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person\naccess to such information.\u201d  The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to\n42\ngrant applicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of\n43\ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance.\u201d  \u201cThe clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should\n44\nerr, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should\n45\nbe allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such sensitive\ninformation.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a\n46\ndetermination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not\n47\nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a\nclearance.48\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth potentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and\nmitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline. In evaluating the security worthiness of an\napplicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6 2a(1)-\n(9) of the Directive to be considered in evaluating a person\u2019s eligibility to hold a security clearance.\n\n10\nAdditionally, each security clearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision\nbased on the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, along with\nthe factors listed in the Guidelines. Specifically these are: (1) the nature and seriousness of the\nconduct and surrounding circumstances; (2) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (3) the age\nof the applicant; (4) the motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was\nnegligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the consequences; (5) the absence or\npresence of rehabilitation; and (6) the probability that the circumstances or conduct will continue or\nrecur in the future. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against\nclearance is not outcome determinative, the revised adjudicative guidelines should be followed\nwhenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance.\nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those\nwhich would mitigate security concerns, pertaining to the adjudicative guidelines are set forth and\ndiscussed in the conclusions below.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards discussed above.\nI reach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the SOR.\nBased upon consideration of the evidence, I find the following adjudicative guidelines most\npertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case:\nGuideline G-Alcohol Consumption is a security concern because excessive alcohol\nconsumption leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure to control impulses, and\ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \nGuideline J-Criminal Conduct is a security concern because criminal activity creates doubt\nabout a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question\na person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \nBased on all of the evidence, Alcohol Consumption (AC DC) 22(a) (alcohol-related\nincidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse,\ndisturbing the peace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is\ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent) applies. Applicant has two convictions for\ndriving while intoxicated. One occurred in 2002 and the most recent incident occurred in 2005, with\nthe resulting conviction in May 2007.\nI have considered all of the mitigating conditions and especially considered Alcohol\nConsumption Mitigating Condition (AC MC) 23(a) (so much time has passed, or the behavior was\nso infrequent, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does\nnot cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment), and AC\nMC 23(b) (The individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol abuse, provides\nevidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has established a pattern of abstinence (if\nalcohol dependent) or responsible use (if an alcohol abuser)). I find neither of these mitigating\nconditions apply. Applicant was convicted of DWI in 2002. He was again arrested in 2005 for DWI\n\n11\nand convicted in 2007. He was ordered by the criminal court judge, as a term of his release pending\ntrial, to arrange for antabuse, have an interlock ignition system installed on his car and attend AA.\nHe failed to comply with the court\u2019s order, his bond was revoked and he was confined. He denied\nat his hearing, regarding the DWI charge, that he was intoxicated, but later pled guilty to the charge.\nAs part of his sentence he is required to screen for antabuse by a physician, maintain a deep lung\ninterlock ignition system on his car and complete a DWI course. This sentence was awarded on May\n15, 2007. Applicant\u2019s compliance with his sentence is ongoing. Therefore, I find 23(a) does not\napply because Applicant is still serving his sentence regarding his DWI and it was not a one time\noccurrence. These circumstances raise security issues regarding his good judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness. No evidence was presented that Applicant has acknowledged issues of alcohol abuse\nnor has he taken any action to overcome it. Therefore, I find 23(b) does not apply.\nBased on all of the evidence, Criminal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (CC DC) 31(a) (a\nsingle serious crime or multiple lesser offenses), CC DC 31(c) (allegations or admissions of criminal\nconduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted),\nand CC DC 31(d) (individual is currently on parole or probation) apply. Applicant has two DWI\nconvictions and a reckless driving conviction. He was also charged with 19 speeding violations and\nan assault charge that was later dismissed. Part of Applicant\u2019s sentence for his last DWI conviction\nis to be under community supervision for two years. I find this is equivalent to probation. \nI have considered all of the mitigating conditions and especially considered Criminal Conduct\nMitigating Condition (CC MC) 32(a) (so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior\nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not\ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment), and CC MC 32(d)\n(there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time\nwithout recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher education,\ngood employment record, or constructive community involvement). As detailed above Applicant has\na history and pattern of misconduct. Applicant has a pattern of violating laws and rules and not\naccepting responsibility for his actions. His personal priorities take precedent over traffic rules that\nprotect the safety of those on the roads. It appears that it was more important to Applicant to advance\nhis personal success than it was to obey the law. It also appears that it was more important to abide\nby his professor\u2019s attendance requirements to complete his degree than it was to obey the law.\nApplicant\u2019s criminal conduct reflects a pattern that raises a serious security concern regarding his\ngood judgment, reliability and trustworthiness. Applicant\u2019s belief that he can separate his\nprofessional conduct from his personal conduct shows a serious gap in security awareness. Despite\nhis extensive training he failed to understand the ramifications of his conduct. Applicant is currently\nserving the sentence for his latest DWI. He is under community supervision for two years and a\ncurfew, among other requirements. I find 32(a) does not apply.\nI also find there is no evidence at this juncture of successful rehabilitation. Applicant denied\nthat he was intoxicated regarding his second DWI offense when testifying at his hearing and later\nadmitted it when he pled guilty. I am not convinced that Applicant is remorseful for his conduct, but\nonly for the consequences of it. I find 32(d) does not apply. \nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The\nobjective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a person's\nlife to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance. Indeed,\n\n12\nthe adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in considering the \u201cwhole\nperson\u201d concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of their acts, omissions,\nmotivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful\nanalysis.\nI considered the whole person in evaluating the case. I considered Applicant\u2019s credibility,\ndemeanor and responsiveness when testifying. Applicant is a very successful engineer who has been\na valuable employee and asset to his company. He has outstanding performance reviews and has\nexcelled in the programs he has been involved in. He is well thought of by his colleagues. Applicant\nhas a pattern of rules violations, some involving alcohol. He repeatedly exercised poor judgment in\nviolating the traffic laws. I find Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns regarding\nGuideline G, alcohol consumption, and Guideline J, criminal conduct. Therefore, I am not persuaded\nby the totality of the evidence in this case that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to\ngrant Applicant a security clearance. Accordingly, Guidelines G and J are decided against Applicant.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1.

On October 25, 2006, DOHA issued a statement of reasons advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\n\n2\nrequested a decision on the written record. On May 29, 2007, after considering the record,\nAdministrative Judge Mark W. Harvey denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nApplicant filed a timely appeal pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge lacked subject matter\njurisdiction to issue his decision.  We remand the case to the Judge.\nApplicant\u2019s brief contains new evidence.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.  We are presenting the\nentirety of her arguments solely for the purpose of addressing her jurisdictional challenge.  Applicant\ncontends that, after receiving a request from DOHA to provide a response to the File of Relevant\nMaterial (FORM), she and her employer asked the employer\u2019s security officer to terminate her\nrequest for a security clearance.  He agreed to do so.  She states she then believed that she did not\nneed to reply to the FORM.  She further advises that she was \u201cdismayed\u201d upon receipt of the Judge\u2019s\nadverse decision, because she believed the case was over.  Applicant states that \u201c[i]n a telephone call\nto [security officer] on June 6, 2007, he told me that he did everything he needed to do to withdraw\nthe application and had done so the same day that he told me he would (March 23).  He also told me\nthat he believed the failure to withdraw the case was an error on the part of DOHA.\u201d  Accompanying\nher brief is a statement by the security officer, to the effect that, following the request from Applicant\nand the employer, he spoke with a representative at DOHA, who advised him to withdraw\nApplicant\u2019s SCA by means of the Joint Clearance and Access Verification System (JCAVS).  The\nsecurity officer states that he did as instructed by the DOHA representative.  \nDirective \u00b6 4.4 provides that if an applicant\u2019s need for classified information terminates, then\nprocessing of his or her case shall cease.  Exceptions to this policy are if a hearing has commenced,\na decision issued, or the applicant provides a written request for the case to continue.  DOHA\nOperating Instruction 29 sets forth detailed implementation of this policy.  Applicant contends, in\neffect, that her need for a clearance had been properly terminated prior to the date for responding to\nthe FORM.  As a consequence, her case should have been terminated without a decision.\nJurisdictional defect can be raised at any point in a DOHA proceeding, \u201cincluding for the first\ntime on appeal.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 02-24227 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 2003).  The matters submitted by\nApplicant raise a serious legal issue which cannot be resolved without fact finding beyond the\nmatters contained in the FORM.  Such fact finding is beyond the scope of the Board\u2019s authority, and\nwe cannot base a decision on new evidence.  Therefore, we remand this case to the Judge to reopen\nthe record (1) to allow the parties to present evidence as to the facts and circumstances regarding the\nalleged withdrawal of Applicant\u2019s SCA and (2) to make a ruling as to whether Applicant\u2019s case\nshould have been terminated without a clearance decision being issued.

Blank, Jr., Esquire, Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant\u2019s falsification of her clearance application and financial irresponsibility render her\nan unsuitable candidate for a security clearance. Clearance denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nApplicant challenges the 15 February 2007 Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) recommending denial or revocation of her clearance because of\nfinancial considerations and personal conduct.  Applicant answered the SOR 10 March 2007, and\n1\n\n2\nrequested a hearing. The case was assigned to me 12 July 2007, and I convened a hearing 14 August\n2007. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) 22 August 2007.\nPROCEDURAL RULINGS\nApplicant arrived nearly an hour late for her hearing because she lacked the necessary mass\ntransit fare to depart from her home in time to make her scheduled hearing. Although I had already\nterminated her case because of her failure to appear, I reopened the case in the interest of judicial\neconomy.\nAt hearing, I granted Department Counsel\u2019s motion to amend typographical errors in the SOR\n(Tr. 29-31). I also left the record open to allow Applicant to provide any proof of the payments she\nclaimed to have made during her testimony. Applicant responded in a timely fashion, but the\ndocuments she submitted were unresponsive to the reason the record was left open, being either\nirrelevant or duplicative of evidence already in the record. Accordingly, I have not considered her\npost-hearing submission (A.E. B).\nApplicant testified that she had been terminated from her employment requiring the clearance\nin January 2007, but was subject to recall if she obtained her clearance. Consequently, DOHA retains\njurisdiction over this case.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant denied the financial allegations of the SOR, except for \u00b6\u00b6 1.l.\u20131.s., in which she\nadmitted failure to file her state and federal income tax returns, and her January 2000 bankruptcy\npetition. Accordingly, I incorporate her admissions as findings of fact. She denied falsifying her\nclearance application. She is a 50-year-old senior help desk analyst for a defense contractor since\nJuly 2004. She has previously held a clearance, but her current status is unclear.\nWhen Applicant submitted her clearance application in October  2004 (G.E. 1), she answered\n\u201cno\u201d to question 38 asking if she had been 180 days delinquent on any accounts within the last seven\nyears. In fact, she had been 180 days delinquent on 10 accounts totaling over $16,000. She had\ndisclosed her 2000 bankruptcy petition, and averred that all her delinquent debts had been\ndischarged. Applicant has offered no credible explanation for her failure to disclose her financial\ndifficulties. She has claimed that she did not know the details of her credit report when she\ncompleted the clearance application. Nevertheless, she had been unemployed for the six months prior\nto July 2004 and had to have known she had delinquent accounts, because she was not paying her\ncreditors and had been receiving collection letters from them.\nThe SOR alleges 13 delinquent debts totaling nearly $18,000. Each of these debts is\ndocumented in Applicant\u2019s credit reports. Applicant admits three delinquent state tax debts for 2002,\n2003, and 2005, totaling over $2,300. She also admits failing to file her federal income tax returns\nfrom 2002-2006, liability as yet undetermined.\n\nThe record here is unclear. She reports being unemployed from October 1999 to July 2000, at the same time\n2\nshe reports being employed from December 1999 to July 2000.\n3\nApplicant has a history of financial problems dating back to January 2000. She ascribes her\nfinancial difficulties to several periods of unemployment, her willingness to help extended family\nmembers to her financial detriment, and her own financial irresponsibility. According to her\nclearance application, she has been employed in a variety of positions since September 1993. She\nwas unemployed the last six months of 1996. Between January 1999 and July 2000, she was\nunemployed except for four months in the middle of 1999.   In January 2000, she filed for chapter\n2\n13 bankruptcy protection, but she defaulted on plan payments. The chapter 13 petition was converted\nto chapter 7 in May 2002, and she was discharged from her dischargeable debts in August 2002. Of\nthe 11 debts Applicant denied, she claims that some were discharged in her 2002 discharge, some\nwere paid, some settled, and some covered by insurance. However, she has been unable to\ncorroborate any of these claims. After her bankruptcy discharge, she continued to experience\nfinancial problems, with new debts arising in 2002. She was employed continuously from at least\nJuly 2000 to January 2004, when she was unemployed for six months before obtaining the job that\nrequires her clearance. She has since been laid off from that job, but is subject to recall if she obtains\nher clearance.\n Applicant\u2019s finances\u2014and her financial records\u2014are in disarray, and are likely to remain\nso. Her ongoing financial distress is best exemplified by the fact that she came to the hearing\nunprepared to address the debts alleged in the SOR, because she was in \u201csurvival mode,\u201d trying to\nkeep her utilities from being disconnected (Tr. 64-65). In addition, she had to file a second chapter\n13 bankruptcy petition in May 2007 to forestall foreclosure on her mortgage, seriously past due (A.E.\nA). Her personal financial statements (G.E. 2, 3) show negative monthly cash flow. \nPOLICIES AND BURDEN OF PROOF\nThe Directive, Enclosure 2 lists adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating an\nApplicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information. Administrative Judges must assess both\ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative issue fairly raised by the facts and\ncircumstances presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense\nconsideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3. of the Directive. The presence or absence of a\ndisqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or against Applicant. However, specific\nadjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them, as they\nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified information.\nConsidering the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative\nguidelines are Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct).\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant or continue an Applicant\u2019s security clearance. The government must prove, by something\nless than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it\nestablishes a prima facie case against access to classified information. Applicant must then refute,\nextenuate, or mitigate the government\u2019s case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the\nApplicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.\n\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n3\n\u00b619.(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; (b) indebtedness caused by frivolous or irresponsible\n4\nspending and the absence of any evidence of willingness or intent to pay the debt or establish a realistic plan to pay the\ndebt; (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;\n\u00b620 (a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is\n5\nunlikely to recur . . . \n\u00b620.(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control . . . and\n6\nthe individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n\u00b620.(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that\n7\nthe problem is being resolved or is under control;\n\u00b620.(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\n8\n4\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship with the\ngovernment based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a compelling interest in\nensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability, and trustworthiness of those\nwho must protect national interests as their own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d\nstandard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in\nfavor of the government.3\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe Government established a case for disqualification under Guideline F, and Applicant did\nnot mitigate the security concerns. Government records reflect nearly $18,000 of delinquent debt\nacquired after Applicant\u2019s bankruptcy discharge in August 2002.  While her periods of\n4\nunemployment undoubtedly contributed to her financial difficulties, she has compounded them by\nproviding financial assistance to extended family members and spending on non-essentials when her\nfinances are extremely tight.\nApplicant meets none of the mitigating factors for financial considerations. Her financial\ndifficulties are both recent and multiple;  indeed they appear to be ongoing. Applicant has\n5\nestablished that her debts were only partially due to circumstances beyond her control, and she has\nnot acted responsibly in addressing her debts.  There is no evidence that she has sought credit\n6\ncounseling, beyond what is required for her most recent chapter 13 bankruptcy filing, or otherwise\nbrought the problem under control.  Applicant has taken no verifiable steps to address her debts.  Her\n7\n8\nchapter 13 bankruptcy plan primarily addresses her mortgage arrears, and it is not clear that she will\nbe able to remain current with plan payments or address any of her past and newly acquired debts.\nThe record contains little to suggest that Applicant would be able to become or remain financially\nstable in the future. I conclude Guideline F against Applicant.\nThe government established a case for disqualification under Guideline E, and Applicant did\nnot mitigate the security concerns. She deliberately concealed the nature and extent of her financial\n\n\u00b616.(a) The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts  from any personnel\n9\nsecurity questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, . . . [or] determine\nsecurity clearance eligibility or trustworthiness. . .;\n\u00b617.(a)  The individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification\n10\nbefore being confronted with the facts;\n\u00b617.(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission or concealment was caused or significantly contributed\n11\nto by improper or inadequate advice of authorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual\nspecifically concerning the security clearance process . . . [later] the individual cooperated fully and truthfully.\nDepartment Counsel acknowledged that this allegation duplicated the allegation at SOR 1.f.\n12\n5\nproblems.  Further, none of the Guideline E mitigating conditions apply. There is no evidence\n9\ndemonstrating that she corrected the falsification before being asked about it.

Mason denied\nApplicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6\nE3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse clearance\ndecision is arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.\nApplicant contends that the Judge\u2019s adverse decision should be reversed because the Judge\ndid not give sufficient weight to Applicant\u2019s mitigating evidence.  Applicant has not demonstrated\nthat the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.\nThe presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a\nfavorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a\nwhole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.\nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-10320 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 7, 2007).  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with\nthe Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the\nevidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in\na manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3\n(App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007).\nIn this case, the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the\nseriousness of the disqualifying conduct and considered the possible application of relevant\nconditions and factors.  He reasonably explained why the mitigating evidence was insufficient to\novercome the government\u2019s security concerns.   The Board does not review a case de novo.  The\n1\nfavorable evidence cited by Applicant is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-11172 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 4,\n2007).  After reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant data\nand articulated a satisfactory explanation for his decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

On June 30, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under alcohol consumption\n(Guideline G) and personal conduct (Guideline E). The action was taken pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February\n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended\n(Directive), and adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on\nDecember 29, 2005, and made effective within the Department of Defense for SORs\nissued on or after September 1, 2006. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings,\nexhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nApplicant submitted his answer to the SOR on July 22, 2008, and requested a\ndecision be made on the record in lieu of a hearing. A copy of the government\u2019s File of\nRelevant Material (FORM, the government\u2019s evidence in support of the allegations of\nthe SOR) was sent to Applicant on September 19, 2008. Applicant received the FORM\nNovember 28, 2008\n\n2\non October 6, 2008. His undated response to the FORM has been received in evidence.\nThe case file was assigned to me on November 5, 2008. \nFindings of Fact\nThe SOR contains 11 allegations under the alcohol consumption guideline and\nseven allegations under the personal conduct guideline. Applicant admitted all\nallegations except for SOR 2.a., which he denied. In support of his denial of SOR 2.a.,\nApplicant explained that the investigator, who took his statement in April 2000,\nmisunderstood information he provided about being present during a drug transaction in\nJune 1994, leading to his indictment.\nApplicant is 42 years old, divorced and has seven children. He has been\nemployed as a security guard by a defense contractor since December 1998. He seeks\na security clearance. \nAlcohol Consumption\nAccording to Item 15 (sworn statement dated April 14, 2000) Applicant began\ndrinking about six beers a week when he was 17, and often drank to the point of\nintoxication until he stopped in April 2008 (SOR 1.j.). After joining the United States\n(U.S.) Army at the age of 18, his consumption increased to a case of beer each\nweekend. At age 20 (1986), he got married, and his drinking increased to about a fifth of\nwhiskey and a 1\u00bd cases of beer a week. The pattern continued into his early 20s. He\nasserted he reduced his drinking in the past 10 years by discontinuing use of hard\nliquor, and drinking only about a case of beer generally on the weekends. When under\nthe influence of alcohol, Applicant is generally sociable, but can become mean and\nviolent if provoked. In 1990, Applicant did not think he had an alcohol problem, but the\nU.S. Army required that he complete an inpatient, substance abuse program in the Fall\nof 1990. No military records were provided concerning the inpatient treatment. \nIn May 2003, Applicant responded to questions (Item 17) about the scope of his\nalcohol use. He claimed he stopped drinking alcohol in May 2002, and began attending\nAlcoholics Anonymous (AA) shortly after completing the counseling conditions of his\nsentence in May 2002 for DWI (SOR 1.g.). \nAccording to his interview November 15, 2007 (Item 29), Applicant reduced his\ndrinking after his conviction for DWI in December 2001, but no mention was made of\nabstinence for any period. Instead, he just drank beer on his two days off every week.\nThe amount of consumption was just enough for him to feel under the influence, with\nconsumption to the point of intoxication occurring about once a month. Applicant felt he\nhad an alcohol problem, but he thought he could control his consumption. If his use\nworsened, he would seek help through counseling or AA. Significantly, Applicant denied\nobserving his friend conduct a drug transaction in June 1994, as he had described in\ndetail in his April 14, 2000 statement (Item 15). See, SOR 2.a.\n\n3\nOn March 12, 2008 (Item 30), a licensed substance-abuse treatment practitioner\n(LSATP) from a substance abuse services center, submitted a report to DOHA\nregarding an evaluation of Applicant. Her report was based on an interview of Applicant,\nhis government interview on November 15, 2007 (Item 15), and a urine screen.\nApplicant did not appear to understand his alcohol addiction, prompting the LSATP to\nopine the initial treatment experience was not effective in increasing Applicant\u2019s\nknowledge of substance abuse. The practitioner opined he should enroll in a relapse\nprevention program, including a 12-step component and random drug testing. Based on\nan evaluation of her interview with Applicant and his government interview in November\n2007, she determined that alcohol dependence would be an appropriate, preliminary\ndiagnosis (Item 32).\nAlcohol Related Incidents\nWhile in the Army in April 1990 (SOR 1.a.), Applicant was arrested and charged\nwith driving while under the influence (DWI), a violation of Article 111 of the Uniform\nCode of Military Justice (UCMJ). In August 1990 (SOR 1.b.), Applicant was arrested\nand charged with DWI and using a false visitor\u2019s pass in violation of Article 111 of the\nUCMJ. He received an Article 15, resulting in a reduction in rank and a requirement to\nattend inpatient alcohol treatment. In March 1991 (SOR 1.c.), Applicant violated Article\n92 of the UCMJ after he was found to unfit for duty (sleeping on duty) due to having\nconsumed too much alcohol. As a result of the three above alcohol-related offenses,\nApplicant\u2019s security clearance was revoked by the U.S. Army (SOR 1.d.), yet he\ncontinued to drink alcohol. \nAs set forth in SOR 1.e., Applicant was found guilty of drinking in public on\nschool grounds in November 1992. In October 1999 (SOR 1.f.), Applicant consumed\nalcohol before he was arrested and charged with assault and battery. The charges were\ndismissed. \nOn December 22, 2001 (SOR 1.g.), Applicant was arrested for DWI and other\ncharges. The other charges were dismissed, and Applicant was found guilty of DWI. He\nwas sentenced to 5 months in jail, his license was suspended, and he was ordered to\ncomplete alcohol awareness counseling. He completed counseling in May 2002. \nIn May 2003, Applicant stated he had stopped alcohol consumption in May 2002\n(SOR 1.h.), and had no plans for alcohol use in the future. However, he resumed\ndrinking. In September 2004, Applicant was denied a security clearance (SOR 1.i.) by\nanother DOHA Administrative Judge, based on alcohol use, criminal conduct, and\npersonal conduct. \nIn May 2008, Applicant was diagnosed alcohol dependent (SOR 1.i.) by an\nLSATP, who recommended treatment, random urine testing, and breath testing for\nalcohol. \n\n4\nPersonal Conduct\nOn April 14, 2000 (Item 15, sworn statement), Applicant indicated he witnessed a\ndrug sale in June 1994. On March 3, 2008 (SOR 2.a.), Applicant affirmed his November\n15, 2007 interview by providing false information when he stated he had never seen his\nfriend selling drugs in June 1994 (Item 29). Given Applicant\u2019s detailed description of the\ndrug transaction and his recall of the course the case took in the court system, I choose\nto believe that Applicant observed the drug deal. \nIn May 1990 (SOR 2.g.), Applicant was charged with assault on his spouse. In\nthe same month(SOR 2.f.), Applicant received an Article 15 for driving on the base with\nprivileges revoked. He was found guilty for carrying a concealed weapon (CCW) (SOR\n2.e.) in September 1992. In June 1994, Applicant was charged with felony conspiracy to\ndistribute cocaine (SOR 2.d.), but was acquitted. In July 1996 and August 2003,\nApplicant was charged with assault and battery. (SORs 2.c. and 2.d.) He could recall\nneither incident because there were about six similar incidents which began with him\narriving home late after drinking and/or being with another woman, and his girlfriend\naccusing him of infidelity (Item 29).\nCharacter Evidence\nApplicant provided no evidence of his job performance or of his lifestyle away\nfrom the job. He provided no independent evidence of AA contact, or participation in any\nkind of therapy. He has been employed at his job for almost 10 years. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are flexible rules of law. Recognizing the complexities of human\nbehavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the\nadjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s ultimate adjudicative goal is a fair,\nimpartial and common sense decision. According to the AG, the entire process is a\ncareful, thorough evaluation of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person\nconcept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable information\nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.\nReasonable doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security. In reaching this decision, I have\ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence\n\n5\ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere\nspeculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\nis not restricted to normal duty hours. Rather, the relationship is an-around-the-clock\nresponsibility between an applicant and the federal government. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to the potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\nAnalysis\nAlcohol Consumption (AC)\n21. The Concern. \u201cExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of\nquestionable judgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s lengthy alcohol abuse and alcohol-related conduct activates AC\ndisqualifying condition (DC) 22.a. (alcohol-related conduct away from work); AC DC\n22.b. (alcohol-related incidents at work, such as reporting for work or duty in an\nintoxicated or impaired condition, or drinking on the job, regardless of whether the\nindividual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent); AC DC 22.c.\n(habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment, regardless\nof whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent); and\nAC DC 22.e. (evaluation of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence by a licensed clinical\nsocial worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol treatment program).\nApplicant\u2019s habitual alcohol consumption led to alcohol-related incidents, both outside\nand inside the workplace, an also led to Applicant\u2019s repeated punishment under the\nUCMJ, and finally revocation of his security clearance on December 30,1991. \nApplicant\u2019s drinking continued at abusive levels after his discharge from the\nservice in (circa) 1992. Following a public intoxication conviction on school grounds in\nNovember 1992, and an arrest (no conviction) in October 1999 for assault after he had\nbeen drinking, Applicant was convicted of DWI in December 2001. Though he claims he\nquit drinking and joined AA following the completion of the alcohol awareness program\n\n6\nin May 2002, because there is no mention of this year-long period of sobriety in any of\nthe more recent exhibits, I do not consider his claim credible. A lack of supporting\nevidence for Applicant\u2019s more recent claim in his response to the FORM that he has\nbeen sober since April 2008 is not believable either. \nThe LSATP, director of the community substance abuse center, conducted an\nevaluation of Applicant in March 2008 pursuant to a request by DOHA. After the\nLSATP\u2019s clinical interview of Applicant, her review of his November 2007 interview (Item\n29) and examination of his urine sample, she determined (Item 32) that Applicant\nshould be diagnosed as alcohol dependent. \nThough there are four mitigating conditions under the AC guideline that\npotentially could apply, none do apply because Applicant\u2019s drinking history\ndemonstrates he is not committed to abstinence or recovery from his alcohol\ndependence. AC MC 23.a. (so much time has passed, or the behavior was so\ninfrequent, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\nor does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment) does not apply. Even if I assume he stopped drinking in April 2008, Applicant\nhas only seven months of abstinence. This brief period of abstinence pales in\ncomparison to his 22-year period of alcohol abuse or dependence. \nAC MC 23.b. (the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of\nalcohol abuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has\nestablished a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or responsible use if an\nalcohol abuser) does not apply, because as the LSATP indicated in March 2008 (Item\n30), Applicant does not comprehend his alcohol addiction. His lack of understanding of\nhis alcohol problem makes it more difficult for him to take credible action to overcome\nthe problem. Finally, the short period of abstinence, though encouraging, does not\nconvince me Applicant is firmly on the road of recovery. The other two mitigating\nconditions are inapplicable. \nPersonal Conduct (PC)\n15. The Concern. \u201cConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty,\nor unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. Of\nspecial interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security\nclearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance\nprocess.\u201d\nPC DC 16.b. (deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning\nrelevant facts to an investigator or other official government representative) applies. In\nApril 2000, Applicant provided a detailed description of observing a drug transaction\nbetween his friend and a female in June 1994. He provided a detailed description that\ntracked the case through the criminal justice system and ultimately resulted in his\nacquittal. His denial of this drug transaction in his November 2007 interview, and\n\n7\naffirmation of that denial in his March 3, 2008 interrogatory answers (Item 29) is not\ncredible, is not credible either. Item 15 is a sworn statement (whereas Item 29 is only an\ninterview) that Applicant provided to the government in April 2000. Unlike the interview,\nApplicant\u2019s initials throughout the statement indicate he had a full opportunity to review\nthe statement and make changes. Before Applicant signed the statement, he\nacknowledged that the statement was true as written. As between Item 15 and Item 29,\nI determine Item 15 is more reliable in supporting my conclusion that Applicant did\nobserve a drug transaction in June 1994. \nApplying to Applicant\u2019s conduct that occurred between May 1990 and August\n2003 (SOR 2.g. through 2.b.) is disqualifying condition PC DC 16.c. (credible adverse\ninformation in several adjudicative issue areas that is not sufficient for an adverse\ndetermination under any other single guideline, but which, when considered as a whole,\nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness,\nunreliability , lack of candor, unwilling to comply with rules and regulations, or other\ncharacteristics indicating the person may not properly safeguard classified information).\nIn April 1990, Applicant received Article 15 punishment for DWI, and his driving\nprivileges on the base were suspended. One month later, he violated his suspension\n(rules violation) by driving on the base with his privileges suspended. \nIn September 1992, at age 26, Applicant was arrested and convicted for carrying\na concealed weapon. In June 1994, Applicant was arrested for conspiracy to distribute\ncocaine and distribution of cocaine. Although he was acquitted of the charges, he\nexercised poor judgment by associating with drug users. In June 1996 and August\n2003, Applicant was arrested for assault and battery. Applicant recalled that both\nincidents were started after he came home late after drinking or being with another\nwoman.\nThere are four mitigating conditions (MC) that are potentially applicable to the\ncircumstances of this case. Those conditions are: PC MC 17.a. (the individual made\nprompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment or falsification, before\nbeing confronted with the facts); PC MC 17.c. (the offense was so minor, or so much\ntime has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment); and, PC MC 17.d. (the individual has\nacknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to change the behavior or taken\nother positive steps to alleviate stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused\nuntrustworthy, unreliable or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely\nto recur). PC MC 17.a. is not applicable as Applicant continues to deny he falsified his\ninterview in November 2007 regarding his observation of a drug transaction in June\n1994. PC MC 17.c. is inapplicable because Applicant\u2019s ongoing belief he did not falsify\nthe interview continues to cast doubt on his judgment and reliability. The second\nelement of the condition cannot be applied as the most recent falsification occurred less\nthan nine months before the hearing. The remaining mitigating conditions are\ninapplicable. Applicant\u2019s intentional attempt to conceal the drug transaction in June\n1994, and his misrepresentations about his alcohol abstinence for a year or more,\n\n8\ncoupled with the instances of poor judgment between 1990 and August 2003, have not\nbeen mitigated. \nWhole Person Concept (WPC)\nThe AG indicates the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and whole person concept. The WPC is made of nine\ngeneral policy factors:\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nthe participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation\nand other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the\npotential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and, (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nFactor 6 (the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other behavior changes)\nand factor 9 (the likelihood of continuation or recurrence) are critical factors in this case.\nApplicant presented no independent evidence which shows rehabilitation or behavioral\nchanges from his 22-year history of alcohol abuse or dependence. Applicant was\nconvicted of four alcohol-related offenses between April 1990 and March 1991. Then,\nApplicant, at age 25, had his security clearance revoked in December 1991 because of\nhis alcohol problem. After his discharge in 2002, Applicant continued to drink, and got\ninvolved in alcohol-related incidents.\nOn September 10, 2004, Applicant was denied a security clearance by an\nAdministrative Judge of DOHA. The reason for the denial was Applicant\u2019s drinking\npattern and alcohol-related conduct. Rather than discontinue his drinking and/or seek\ntreatment Applicant has continued to consume alcohol. After reading Applicant\u2019s\ninterview with a government investigator in November 2007, and conducting an\ninterview with him in March 2008, the LSATP believed that, based on the lack of insight\ninto his illness, he should be diagnosed with alcohol dependence and was in need of a\ntreatment program. Based on the totality of the evidence, the AC and PC guidelines are\nfound against Applicant.  \n\n9\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1 (Alcohol Consumption, Guideline G):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f. \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i. \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j.\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2 (Personal Conduct, Guideline E):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.d.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.e.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.f.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.g.\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Clearance is denied.\n\nPursuant to Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended\n1\nand modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive).\nItem 2.\n2\nItems 4, 6-8.\n3\n4www.usdoj.gov/dea/pubs/abuse; 21 CFR 1308.13.\nItems 4, 6-8.\n5\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for Applicant. On December 28, 2006, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons1\n(SOR) detailing the basis for its decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline G (Alcohol\nConsumption) and Guideline H (Drug Involvement) of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG)\nissued on December 29, 2005, and implemented by the Department of Defense for SORs issued after\nSeptember 1, 2006. Applicant answered the SOR in writing on January 25, 2007, and elected to have\nthe case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the\nGovernment's written case on March 29, 2007. A complete copy of the file of relevant material\n(FORM) was provided to Applicant, who was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit\nmaterial to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the disqualifying conditions. Applicant received the FORM\non April 9, 2007, and responded on April 24, 2007. The case was assigned to me on May 2, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant is a 60-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for the same\nemployer for more than 30 years and has held a security clearance for the same period. He married\nin 1994. He has an adult daughter and a teenage stepdaughter. Applicant served in the U.S. Navy\nfrom 1966 to 1972, and was honorably discharged as a second class petty officer (E-5). He has an\nassociate\u2019s degree.2\nApplicant was admitted as an inpatient to a health center in December 1996, for alcohol\ndetoxification. He completed an outpatient program upon his release. Applicant remained sober from\nDecember 1996, until about January 2004, when he started drinking again.3\nApplicant had surgery in about 2004. He was prescribed Vicodin for the pain. Vicodin is the\nbrand name of a prescription drug that is a combination of acetaminophen and hydrocodone.\nAcetaminophen is an over-the-counter analgesic, but hydrocodone is an opiate and a Schedule III\ncontrolled substance.  Applicant also took his wife\u2019s Vicodin.  It is illegal to take someone else\u2019s\n4\n5\nprescription drugs which contain a controlled substance.\nApplicant was admitted to the intensive care unit of a hospital in about July 2004, after he\ndrank denatured isopropyl alcohol. He was treated and transferred to another hospital for alcohol\ndetoxification. He told the hospital that he had a relapse about four months prior to his admission\n\nItems 4, 6-8.\n6\nItems 4, 6, 7.\n7\nItems 4, 6, 7.\n8\nItems 4-6.\n9\nItem 4.\n10\n4\nand that his opiate abuse led him back to alcohol because he ran out of Vicodin. He admitted he\ndrank denatured alcohol in the past, but this time he just kept drinking it even though it made him\nsick. His medical records indicate Applicant admitted intermittent drinking and abstaining since\nJanuary 2004. His discharge summary reflects a diagnosis by a medical doctor (M.D.) of alcohol\ndependence and opiate abuse. It further states that Applicant admitted that he had been drinking for\nthe previous couple of weeks. Applicant was discharged and placed in a chemical dependency\noutpatient program.6\nApplicant remained sober for a time. He had a relapse in January 2005, and drank alcohol.\nApplicant was treated at a hospital in January 2005, for chemical dependence. He was admitted to\na religious-based substance abuse treatment facility in about May 2005. He was discharged in about\nJune 2005.7\nApplicant was admitted to a hospital for alcohol detoxification in about August 2005, after\nhe again drank denatured isopropyl alcohol. His medical records show Applicant was drinking\nalmost a pint of vodka a day. He was also taking his wife\u2019s Vicodin, and replacing it with Tylenol.\nInitially there was some indication of opiate dependence, but the final diagnosis by an M.D., was\nalcohol dependence and opiate abuse.8\nApplicant was arrested on January 2, 2006, and charged with operating a motor vehicle while\nintoxicated (OWI), operating with a blood alcohol content (BAC) more than .08% and less than\n.15%, and speeding. Applicant drove his car into a ditch. His BAC was .13%. Applicant pled guilty\non January 3, 2006, to OWI and speeding. The remaining charge was dismissed. Applicant was\nsentenced to jail for one year, with all but eight days suspended, community service, a fine and costs,\nand he was required to attend a drug and alcohol counseling program. Applicant successfully\ncompleted the court ordered counseling program on December 6, 2006.9\nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted to \u201ca one-day relapse in Jan of 2004,\u201d a\n\u201csingle day relapse in July 2004 after drinking denatured ethyl alcohol,\u201d to \u201cdrinking a small amount\nof isopropyl alcohol in Aug of [200]5 . . .  [t]he opiate indications were from painkillers at home\nprescribed for eye surgery and from other pain episodes,\u201d and \u201cdrinking on Jan. 2, 2006.\u201d10\nApplicant has remained sober for more than 16 months. He completed a relapse prevention\ncounseling program from December 2006 to March 2007. His addiction counselor reported\nApplicant \u201cwas discharged successfully with a good prognosis of recovery if he continues to use the\n\nItem 4; Applicant\u2019s response to FORM.\n11\nDepartment of the Navy v.

Or. 10865 \u00a7 7.\n17\n5\ntools he gained and stay connected to his sober support system.\u201d Applicant participates in Alcoholics\nAnonymous (AA), has a sponsor, and receives support from his church.  \n11\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  As Commander in Chief, the President has\n12\n\u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine\nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person\naccess to such information.\u201d  The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to\n13\ngrant applicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  An applicant has the ultimate burden of\n14\ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his or her\nsecurity clearance. The clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations\nshould err, if they must, on the side of denials.  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant\n15\nshould be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such\nsensitive information.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a\n16\ndetermination as to the loyalty of an applicant. It is merely an indication that the applicant has not\nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a\nclearance.  \n17\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth potentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and\nmitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline. Additionally, each security clearance decision\nmust be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and\ncircumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the adjudicative process factors listed in the\nDirective and AG \u00b6 2(a).\nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those\nwhich would mitigate security concerns, are set forth and discussed in the conclusions section below.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n6\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards discussed above.\nI reach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the SOR.\nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption\nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the\nfailure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and\ntrustworthiness.\nThe potential Alcohol Consumption Disqualifying Conditions (AC DC) in this case are AC\nDC 22(a) (alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence,\nfighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of\nwhether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent), AC DC 22(c)\n(habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment, regardless of whether\nthe individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent), AC DC 22(d) (diagnosis\nby a duly qualified medical professional (e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of\nalcohol abuse or alcohol dependence), and AC DC 22(f) (relapse after diagnosis of alcohol abuse\nor dependence and completion of an alcohol rehabilitation program).\nApplicant received alcohol rehabilitation treatment in 1996. He remained sober for a number\nof years, and then had a series of relapses, followed by hospitalization, treatment and additional\nrelapses. Applicant was hospitalized in 2004, and again in 2005, after he drank denatured alcohol.\nHe attended alcohol rehabilitation programs on at least four occasions in 2004 and 2005. He was\ndiagnosed by M.D.\u2019s as alcohol dependent in 2004 and 2005. He was convicted of OWI in January\n2006, after he crashed his car while intoxicated. All of the above listed Alcohol Consumption\nDisqualifying Conditions are established. I do not find sufficient evidence for a finding that\nApplicant was admitted for treatment in January 2004. SOR \u00b6 1.c is concluded in Applicant\u2019s favor.\nThere are three potential Alcohol Consumption Mitigating Conditions (AC DC) in this case,\nAC DC 23(a) (so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it happened under\nsuch unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment), AC DC 23(b) (the individual acknowledges\nhis or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol abuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this\nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or responsible use (if\nan alcohol abuser)), and AC DC 23(d) (the individual has successfully completed inpatient or\noutpatient counseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has demonstrated a clear\nand established pattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment\nrecommendations, such as participation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar\norganization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical professional or a\nlicensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol treatment program).\nApplicant has remained sober for more than 16 months. He attends AA and has a sponsor.\nHe completed a relapse prevention counseling program from December 2006 to March 2007, and\nreceived a good prognosis of recovery from his addiction counselor if he continues to use the tools\nhe gained and stays connected to his sober support system. Because of Applicant\u2019s repeated history\n\n7\nof treatment and relapses, I find he has not been sober long enough to establish any of the alcohol\nmitigating conditions.\nGuideline H: Drug Involvement\nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and because it\nraises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\nDrug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner that deviates from\napproved medical direction. Applicant abused Vicodin and received a diagnosis by an M.D., of\nopiate abuse. This raises Drug Involvement Disqualifying Conditions (DI DC) \u00b6 25(a) (any drug\nabuse); DI DC 22(d) (diagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional (e.g., physician, clinical\npsychologist, or psychiatrist) of drug abuse or drug dependence), and DI DC 25(e) (evaluation of\ndrug abuse or drug dependence by a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a\nrecognized drug treatment program), and DI DC 25(g) (any illegal drug use after being granted a\nsecurity clearance).\nThe Drug Involvement Mitigating Conditions (DI MC) to consider in Applicant\u2019s case are\nDI MC 26(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment), DI MC 26(b) (a demonstrated intent not to abuse\nany drugs in the future, such as (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2)\nchanging or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; (3) an appropriate period of\nabstinence; (4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for any\nviolation); DI MC 26(c) (abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness during\nwhich these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended), and DI MC 26(d) (satisfactory\ncompletion of a prescribed drug treatment program, including but not limited to rehabilitation and\naftercare requirements, without recurrence of abuse and a favorable prognosis by a  duly qualified\nmedical professional). \nApplicant\u2019s Vicodin use came after a doctor prescribed it for pain. He took his Vicodin, but\nalso took his wife\u2019s Vicodin without a prescription, and without her knowledge. Applicant has not\nestablished that the Vicodin was prescribed for a \u201csevere or prolonged illness.\u201d On several occasions,\nApplicant received treatment for his opiate abuse and then relapsed and used again. Applicant did\nnot submit sufficient information to establish any of the Drug Involvement Mitigating Conditions.\nWhole Person Analysis\nThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is an acceptable security risk. Available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in\nreaching a determination. In evaluating Applicant\u2019s case, I have considered the adjudicative process\nfactors listed in the Directive and AG \u00b6 2(a). I have also considered every finding of fact and\nconclusion discussed above. \nApplicant received alcohol rehabilitation treatment in 1996, and remained sober until about\n2004. Between January 2004 and January 2006, Applicant had a number of relapses. He received\n\n8\ntreatment on at least four occasions, and returned to drinking after each program. Applicant was\nhospitalized on two occasions after he drank denatured alcohol. He was also abusing prescription\npain medication. He took his own Vicodin and stole his wife\u2019s medication. Vicodin contains\nhydrocodone, an opiate and a Schedule III controlled substance. Applicant committed a federal crime\nwhen he took his wife\u2019s medication. His last relapse culminated in his crashing his car while\nintoxicated. Applicant mentions in his response to the SOR, a series of one-day relapses. The\nmedical records show Applicant drinking on a number of occasions, over a period of at least several\nweeks, if not months. Applicant was either downplaying his drinking or in denial, either of which\nis a cause of concern. \nI also considered Applicant\u2019s military service. He has a long and stable employment record,\nand has held a security clearance for many years.\nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions and evaluating all the evidence\nin the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns\nbased on his alcohol consumption and drug involvement.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.  Guideline G:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2.

LEONARD\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nJames F. Duffy, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\n\n Executive Order 10865, dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive 5220.6, dated January 2,\n1\n1992, as amended (Directive).\n See Memorandum from the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, dated August 30, 2006, Subject:\n2\nImplementation of Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (December\n29, 2005). \n2\nApplicant has a history of financial problems. She is a 40-year-old single parent of three\nchildren who has struggled to make financial ends meet. Her financial situation was made more\ndifficult due to a diagnosis of autoimmune hepatitis resulting in medical bills and a period of\nunemployment in 2003. In addition to entering into a debt settlement plan, she is making efforts to\neducate herself and improve her financial knowledge and skills. She is carrying a heavy load and\ndoing her best under challenging circumstances to be a financially responsible person. Eligibility for\na security clearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny or revoke her eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order and DoD Directive,  the Defense\n1\nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant on\nJanuary 5, 2007. The SOR\u2014which is equivalent to an administrative complaint\u2014details the factual\nbasis for the action and alleges security concerns under Guideline F for financial considerations. \nIn addition to the Directive, this case is brought under the revised Adjudicative Guidelines\nfor Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (Revised Guidelines) approved by\nthe President on December 29, 2005. The Revised Guidelines were then modified by the Defense\nDepartment, effective September 1, 2006. They supersede or replace the guidelines published in\nEnclosure 2 to the Directive and Appendix 8 to DoD Regulation 5200.2-R, and they apply to all\nadjudications and other determinations where an SOR has been issued on September 1, 2006, or\nthereafter.  Both the Directive and the Regulation are pending formal amendment. The Revised\n2\nGuidelines apply to this case because the SOR is dated January 5, 2007, which is after the effective\ndate. The applicability of the Revised Guidelines was made a matter of record at the start of the\nhearing (R. 18\u201319). \nApplicant timely replied to the SOR and requested a hearing. In her written response to the\nSOR, she admitted having delinquent debts with multiple creditors in the total amount of about\n$37,764. She denied having delinquent debts with multiple creditors in the total amount of $2,452.\nThe case was assigned to me on February 27, 2007. A notice of hearing was issued\nscheduling the hearing for April 23, 2007. The hearing took place as scheduled. DOHA received the\nhearing transcript on May 4, 2007.\nThe record was kept open until May 7, 2007, to allow Applicant to submit additional\ndocumentary evidence. No materials were received by the May 7  deadline. So, a conference call\nth\nwas held with the parties on May 30 , and Applicant indicated that she mailed the materials before\nth\n\n3\nthe deadline. It was agreed that the record would remain open until close of business on June 15,\n2007, to give Applicant an opportunity to resubmit her materials. Applicant made a timely\nsubmission, and those matters were forwarded to me by department counsel who voiced no\nobjections to the matters, which are admitted as Exhibit B.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nBased on the record evidence as a whole, I find that the following facts are true:\n1.\nApplicant is a 40-year-old contractor employee who has worked for a company engaged in\nfederal contracting since June 2005. She is seeking to obtain a security clearance for the first time.\nHer job title or position is functional administrator. Her job duties primarily involve information\ntechnology (e.g., maintaining computer servers). She earns a gross monthly salary of about $3,614.\nHer educational background includes graduating from high school and some college. She married\nin 1985 and divorced in 1989. She has three children, ages 20, 18, and 7. Her 20-year-old child\nrecently moved out of her home. She receives about $300 per month in child support. \n2.\nApplicant has a history of financial problems as established by credit reports from 2001,\n2005, and 2006 (Exhibits 2, 3, and 4). For example, the 2001 credit report contains substantial\nderogatory information. The trade section of the report lists 15 accounts, of which 4 accounts are\ndescribed as bad debts placed for collection. The collections section of the report lists 21 collection\naccounts. The 2005 credit report is similar, as the trade section has 18 accounts, of which  11\naccounts are described in the negative. The collections section of the report lists 21 collection\naccounts. She believes the main reasons for her financial problems were getting behind on her bills,\ngetting sick, and then getting caught up in a vicious cycle (R. 70\u201371). Also, she admits that she did\nnot know how to manage money very well. \n3.\nBased on her admissions to the SOR, Applicant has delinquent debts owed to multiple\ncreditors for about $37,000. A sizable portion of the debt is medical bills. For example, the 2006\ncredit report lists 15 creditors for medical services in the approximate amount of $13,398 (SOR\nsubparagraph 1.w).\n4.\nIn an effort to address her financial problems, Applicant retained the services of company that\nhelps individuals regain control of their personal finances by eliminating debt through settlements\n(Exhibit A). Applicant hire the firm in January 2007. The debt settlement plan is fairly\ncomprehensive, as it includes 11 creditors who appear to be collection agencies (Exhibit A at 4). It\ndoes not include any debt under $600 (R. 31). The plan addresses $17,405 in total unsecured debt\nand estimates it can settle that debt for $6,962 over a period of 36 months (Exhibit A at 2). She has\nmade the initial two payments in February and March. She had not yet made her third payment for\nApril at the time of the hearing. \n5.\nIn addition to the debt settlement plan, Applicant has taken other actions to address her\nfinancial problems (R. 70\u201375). She sought assistance and education from her church. She is learning\n\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n3\n ISCR Case No. 96-0277 (App. Bd. Jul. 11, 1997).\n4\n ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004).\n5\n4\nhow to budget and how to use an Excel spreadsheet as a budgeting tool. She is learning to pay off\ndebts by paying off the smallest one first and then moving on to the next. Also, she is reading a\nlayman\u2019s educational book in the area of personal finance and money management. She was in the\nprocess of moving into her brother\u2019s home to reduce her living expenses and plans to devote the\nextra money to debt repayment. \n6.\nApplicant has been periodically unemployed in the past. In 1992, she was unemployed for\nabout six weeks due to a medical problem. In 1993, she was unemployed for two to three weeks due\nto a medical problem. More recently in 2003, she was unemployed for about two to three months,\noff-and-on, due to a more serious medical problem. \n7.\nIn 2003, Applicant was diagnosed with autoimmune hepatitis, a disease in which the body\u2019s\nimmune system attacks liver cells and causes the liver to become inflamed (hepatitis). This was the\nmedical problem that resulted in her unemployment in 2003 as well as a large amount of medical\nbills. When diagnosed, she was working as a temporary employee of the federal government and\nineligible for health insurance (R. 69\u201370). She is now in remission, she takes no medications, and\nshe sees a doctor about every six months. She has made lifestyles changes (e.g., regular exercise) to\nimprove her health.\nPOLICIES\nThe Revised Guidelines sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a\nperson\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating\nconditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial\ncommonsense decision based upon consideration of all the relevant and material information, the\npertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-person concept. A person granted access\nto classified information enters into a special relationship with the government. The government\nmust be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in those persons to whom it grants access\nto classified information. The decision to deny a person a security clearance is not a determination\nof an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination that the applicant has not met the strict\n3\nguidelines the President has established for granting eligibility for a security clearance.\nBURDEN OF PROOF\nThe only purpose of a security-clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an applicant.  There is no\n4\npresumption in favor of granting or continuing access to classified information.  The government\n5\nhas the burden of presenting evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been\n\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n6\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n7\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n8\n Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a\n9\nsecurity clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10  Cir. 2002) (\u201cIt is likewise plain that there\nth\nis no \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance, so that full-scale due process standards do not apply to cases such as Duane\u2019s.\u201d).\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.\n10\n5\ncontroverted.  An applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or\n6\nmitigate facts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate burden\n7\nof persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.8\nNo one has a right to a security clearance.  As noted by the Supreme Court in Department\n9\nof Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations\nshould err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the\n10\nDirective, any doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information\nwill be resolved in favor of protecting national security.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe general concern under Guideline F for financial considerations is that a concern typically\nexists due to significant unpaid debts. Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to\nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal or unethical acts to generate funds to meet\nfinancial obligations. Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be\nirresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and safeguarding classified\ninformation.   \nHere, based on the record evidence as a whole, a security concern is raised by significant\nunpaid debts. Applicant has a well-established history of financial problems. Her derogatory\nfinancial history is a security concern because it indicates inability (not unwillingness) to satisfy\ndebts and a history of not meeting financial obligations within the meaning of Guideline F.\nI reviewed the MC under the guideline and conclude she receives credit in mitigation. Each\nMC is briefly summarized and discussed below.\nThe first MC\u2014the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur\u2014does not apply. Her financial problems are ongoing, and\nher financial problems involve multiple delinquent debts. Given her longstanding financial problems,\nit is too soon to say that her financial problems are unlikely to recur. \n\n6\nThe second MC\u2014the conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the\nperson\u2019s control\u2014applies. Applicant has been unemployed for three relatively brief periods. She was\nmost recently unemployed in 2003 when she learned she was suffering from autoimmune hepatitis.\nHer serious medical condition generated many unexpected medical bills she was unable to pay. \nThe third MC\u2014the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or\nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control\u2014does not apply. \nApplicant has not receiving counseling as part of the debt settlement plan. Likewise, although she\nhas sought and obtained helpful assistance from her church, it cannot be viewed as counseling from\na financial professional. \nThe fourth MC\u2014the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts\u2014applies. Her good-faith effort is established by her debt settlement plan\nentered into in January 2007 and her other actions to improve her overall financial situation.\nAlthough the debt settlement plan is a recent development, I am persuaded that Applicant is\ncommitted to making it work. Taken together, these circumstances are sufficient to qualify for\ninitiating a good-faith effort within the meaning of the guideline. \nThe fifth MC\u2014the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due\ndebt\u2014does not apply. To the extent she is disputing any of the debts she denies, she has not provided\ndocumentary proof to verify the basis of the dispute. \nThe sixth MC\u2014the affluence resulted from a legal source\u2014is not applicable here.\nI have also considered this case in light of the whole-person concept. Although Applicant\nhas just begun the process of resolving her indebtedness, given the surrounding facts and\ncircumstances, I have no serious doubts about her current suitability for a security clearance. In\nfinancial cases under Guideline F, it is important to remember that the point of the process is not for\nthe government to act as a third-party collector requiring applicants to repay delinquent debts.\nInstead, the point of the process is to assess the security significance of an applicant\u2019s financial\nrecord. \nHere, Applicant is a 40-year-old single parent raising three children, ages 20, 18, and 7. Not\nsurprisingly, she has struggled to make financial ends meet under these circumstances. Add to that\nher diagnosis of autoimmune hepatitis resulting in medical bills and a period of unemployment in\n2003. In addition to entering into a debt settlement plan, she is making efforts to educate herself and\nimprove her financial knowledge and skills. Also, she is moving in with a family member to reduce\nher living expenses and plans to use the extra money to repay debt. Overall, she is carrying a heavy\nload and doing her best under challenging circumstances to be a financially responsible person.\nThese circumstances further mitigate the security concern stemming from her indebtedness.\nWhile Applicant certainly has not presented the strongest possible case or a perfect case, she\nhas presented sufficient information to explain, extenuate, or mitigate the financial considerations\nsecurity concern. Likewise, she has met her ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable\nclearance decision. \n\n7\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nHere are my conclusions for each allegation in the SOR:\nSOR \u00b6 1\u2013Guideline F:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs a\u2013y:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the facts and circumstances, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to\ngrant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

Clearance is denied.\n\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn January 5, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2,\n1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA\ncould not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and\nrecommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be denied\nor revoked.\nThe Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on January 16, 2007, in which he elected to\nhave the case determined on a written record in lieu of a hearing.  Department Counsel submitted\nthe Government\u2019s File of Relevant Material (FORM), consisting of seventeen Government Exhibits\nreferred to in the record as Government Exhibits 1 through 17, to the Applicant on May 24, 2007.\nIn the File of Relevant Material (FORM), Department Counsel made a Motion to Amend the SOR\nby adding the following paragraph to Guideline J, \u201c1(h), Due to the facts alleged in subparagraph\n1.(c), 10 U.S.C. Section 986, (as amended) disqualifies you from having a security clearance granted\nor renewed by the Department of Defense.  However, 10 U.S.C. Section 986, provided that, in a\nmeritorious case, an exception to this prohibition may be authorized.  Should you choose to do so,\nyour response may include information which would support consideration of such a waiver. A copy\nof 10 U.S.C. Section 986 is attached.\u201d  This statute is commonly referred to as the Smith\nAmendment.  The Applicant was sent a copy of the requested amendment and was given 30 days to\nrespond by either filing an objection to the proposed amendment, or if filing no objection, to respond\nto the amendment by admitting or denying the allegation.  The Applicant received the FORM on\nMay 31, 2007, and was instructed to submit information in rebuttal, extenuation or mitigation within\n30 days of receipt.  The Applicant submitted a response dated June 4, 2007.  In his response, the\nApplicant failed to object or respond to the Government\u2019s motion to amend the SOR.  Accordingly,\nthe Government\u2019s Motion is granted and allegation 1(h) is added to the SOR. \nThe case was received by the undersigned for decision on June 11, 2007.  \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe following Findings of Fact are based on the Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, and the\ncontents of the FORM. The Applicant is 39 years old, and is currently working for a defense\ncontractor.  He is  applying for a security clearance in connection with his employment.\nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the basis of\nallegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The following findings of fact are entered\nas to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR:\nParagraph 1 (Guideline J- Criminal Conduct).  The Government alleges that the Applicant is\nineligible for clearance because he engages in criminal conduct.\nThe Applicant admitted to the allegations set forth in the SOR under this guideline.  \n\n4\nFrom 1988, through 1994, the Applicant has been arrested for, or charged with, seven\nseparate drug offenses.  Specifically, he was arrested for Possessing Cocaine on three separate\noccasions, and charged with Distributing Cocaine on four other occasions.  Each of the arrests,\ncharges and convictions are set forth below.    \nIn February 1988, the Applicant was arrested and charged with Possession of Cocaine, a\nmisdemeanor.  He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to seven months confinement.  (See\nGovernment Exhibit 6, p. 3).\nIn December 1994, the Applicant was convicted of Distributing Cocaine and was sentenced\nto 20 years in jail, with 15 years of that sentence suspended.  Applicant served over one year in jail\nas a result of that conviction.  (See Government Exhibits 7, 12 and 16).\nHe was arrested again on March 12, 1994, and charged with Distribution of Cocaine with\nIntent to Distribute, a felony.  (See Government Exhibit 9).\nOn February 8, 1994, the Applicant was charged with Distribution of Cocaine, a felony, on\nJuly 23, 1993.  This charge was nolle prosequi.  (See Government Exhibit 15).\nOn February 8, 1994, the Applicant was charged with Distribution of Cocaine, a felony, on\nJuly 22, 1993.  This charge was nolle prosequi.  (See Government Exhibit 14). \nOn February 8, 1994, the Applicant was charged with Distribution of Cocaine, a felony, on\nJuly 21, 1993.  (See Government Exhibit 13).\nOn February 8, 1994, the Applicant was charged with Distribution of Cocaine, a felony, on\nJuly 16, 1993.  (See Government Exhibit 16).\nHe was arrested on June 15, 1994, and charge with Possession of Cocaine with Intent to\nDistribute, a felony. This charge was dismissed with prejudice.\nIn his response to the FORM dated June 4, 2007, the Applicant stated that all of these things\nhappened when he was very young.  He has paid for his mistakes and he has no intentions of ever\ngetting involved with illegal drugs again.  He is married with children and has a respectful and happy\nlife.  \nParagraph 2 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct).  The Government alleges that the Applicant is\nineligible for clearance because he engaged in questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty,\nor an unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations that raise questions about his ability to\nprotect classified information.\nOn September 23, 2005, the Applicant completed an Electronic Questionnaire for\nInvestigation, otherwise known as a security clearance application.  Concerning Section 23 his Police\nRecord, Question 23(a), asked if he has ever been charged with a felony.  The Applicant answered\n\u201cNO\u201d.  (See Government Exhibit 5).  This was a false response.  Question 23(d), asked if he had you\never been charged with or convicted of any offenses related to alcohol or drugs.  The Applicant\nanswered, \u201cYES\u201d and listed only his conviction for Distribution of Cocaine.  (See Government\n\n5\nExhibit 5).  He failed to list his conviction for possession of cocaine or the charges brought against\nhim on five other occasions for cocaine related offenses.     \nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies divided into\n\"Disqualifying Factors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying Factors and\nMitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:\nGuideline J (Criminal Conduct)  \n30. The Concern. Criminal Activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness.  By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply\nwith laws, rules and regulations.\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n31.(a) A single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses; \n31.(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was\nformally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted;\n31.(f) conviction in a Federal or State court, including a court-martial of a crime, sentenced\nto imprisonment for a term exceeding one year and incarcerated as a result of that sentence for not\nless than a year.\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct)\n15.  The Concern.  Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  Of special interest is any\nfailure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nCondition that could raise a security concern:\n16. (a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel\nsecurity questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations,\ndetermine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.\n\n6\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in evaluating the\nrelevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should consider the following general\nfactors:\n a.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances\nb.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation\n \nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne.  The voluntariness of participation\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes\ng.  The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics and\nconduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question, posed in Section 2 of Executive Order\n10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request\nfor access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period\nof a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is an acceptable security risk.\nEligibility for access to classified information is predicted upon the individual meeting these\npersonnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number of\nvariables known as the whole person concept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past\nand present, favorable and unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The\nAdministrative Judge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence\nwhich is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in\nExecutive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms\nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the Applicant\nconcerned.\u201d\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n7\nIn the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian\nworkers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information twenty-four hours per\nday, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore appropriately concerned when available\ninformation indicates that an Applicant for clearance may be involved in criminal or personal\nconduct that demonstrates poor judgment or unreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding\nof a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the continued holding of a\nsecurity clearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then shifts to the Applicant to go\nforward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation, which is sufficient to overcome or\noutweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The Applicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving\nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the Applicant has\nengaged in criminal conduct (Guideline J ) and dishonesty (Guideline E).  This evidence indicates\npoor judgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.  Because of the\nscope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude there is a nexus or connection with his\nsecurity clearance eligibility.\nConsidering all of the evidence, the Applicant has not introduced persuasive evidence in\nrebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the Government's case under\nGuidelines J and E of the SOR.\nThe Applicant has offered no evidence to refute, mitigate or extenuate his criminal conduct.\nAlthough his criminal conduct occurred over ten years ago, the repeated nature of this conduct calls\ninto question his judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and willingness to comply with laws, rules\nand regulations.\nThe Applicant\u2019s extensive criminal history that includes arrests, charges, convictions and\nincarceration for drug related offenses disqualifies the Applicant from eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Under Criminal Conduct, Disqualifying Conditions 31(a), A single serious crime or\nmultiple lesser offenses; 31(c), allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether\nthe person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted; and 31(f), conviction in a\nFederal or State court, including a court-martial of a crime, sentenced to imprisonment for a term\nexceeding one year and incarcerated as a result of that sentence for not less than a year apply.  The\nApplicant\u2019s arrest and subsequent conviction for distribution of cocaine in March 1994, resulted in\nhim being incarcerated in jail for over one year.  This triggers his disqualification under 10 U.S.C.\nSection 986, from having a security clearance granted or renewed.  No waiver is recommended.\nNone of the mitigating conditions apply.  Accordingly Guideline J is found against the Applicant.\nUnder Personal Conduct, Disqualifying Condition 16(a), deliberate omission, concealment,\nor falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history\nstatement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications,\naward benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award\nfiduciary responsibilities applies.  None of the mitigating conditions apply.  The Applicant\ndeliberately provided false information to the Government on his security clearance application by\nfailing to reveal his extensive criminal history.  It is just not believable that the Applicant could have\n\n8\noverlooked or failed to recall his 1988 conviction for Possession of Cocaine because he served 7\nmonths confinement for the offense.  He also failed to list five other cocaine related offenses.\nAccordingly, Guideline E is found against the Applicant. \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has failed to overcome the Government's case\nopposing his request for a  security clearance.   Accordingly, the evidence supports a finding against\nthe Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary allegations expressed in Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the\nSOR.  \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as required by\nParagraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: Against the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.b.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.c.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.d.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.e.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.f.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n \n \n \n    Subpara.  1.g.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara. 1.h.:          Against the Applicant.\nParagraph 2: Against the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  2.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    \nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.\nDarlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n\n9\n \n\n10\n",

Since 2006, she has been steadily resolving her delinquencies,\nhas obtained a part-time job, and has retained a counseling agency which helped her develop a\npayment plan. She has mitigated the security concern. Clearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn January 26, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant\na Statement of Reasons (SOR) explaining why it was not clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant or continue a security clearance. This action was taken under Executive Order 10865, dated\nFebruary 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive 5220.6, dated January 2, 1992, as amended.\nDOHA received her answer and request for a hearing on February 26, 2007.\nThe case was assigned to  me on April 18, 2007. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on April\n27, 2007, scheduling it for May 21, 2007. During the hearing, I received 33 government exhibits, six\nApplicant exhibits, and the testimony of three Applicant witnesses. DOHA received the transcript\non June 6, 2007.\nPROCEDURAL MATTERS\nThe government withdrew SOR subparagraph 2.b(14).  Applicant did not answer\n1\nsubparagraph 1.n, \u201cOn or about May 9, 2003, you made and issued two checks in amounts greater\nthan $200 drawn on a bank account with insufficient funds,\u201d asserting, in essence, that the allegation\nwas vague and overbroad. The government moved to amend it to read as follows: \u201cOn or about May\n9, 2003, you made and issued one check in an amount greater than $200 drawn on a bank account\nwith insufficient funds.\u201d Applicant did not object, and I granted the motion. \nAlthough an SOR does not have to satisfy the strict requirements of a criminal indictment,\nit must still place an applicant on adequate notice of the allegations so that she may have a\nreasonable opportunity to respond and prepare a defense.  Subparagraph 1.n, as amended, does not\n2\nmeet this minimum threshold. Moreover, it remains vague and overbroad. I did not consider it in\nmaking my decision.\nFINDINGS OF FACT \nApplicant admitted subparagraphs 1.a through 1.d, 1.f, and 1.h through 1.l. She denied\nsubparagraphs 1.e, 1.g, 1.m, 1.o through 1.s, and Paragraph 2. The SOR admissions are incorporated\ninto the findings of fact. In addition, I make the following findings of fact.\n\nTr. 24.\n3\nTr. 155.\n4\nTr. 169.\n5\nCustomer Recognition Awards, dated January 31, 2006 and July 20, 2006, as listed in Answer, dated February\n6\n26, 2007 at 19 and 21.\nTr. 54.\n7\nExhibit 3, Signed, Sworn Statement, dated August 19, 2002, at 4.\n8\nTr. 60.\n9\nTr. 65.\n10\nExhibit 3 at 4; Tr. 38.\n11\nTr. 38.\n12\n3\nApplicant is a 38-year-old single woman with two children, ages 12 and eight. The children\u2019s\nfather is an ex-boyfriend with whom she lived from 1993 to 1999. She has a high school diploma,\nand is working toward an undergraduate degree in criminal justice. For the past two and a half years,\nshe has worked as a security specialist.3\nApplicant is highly respected at her job. Her immediate supervisor characterizes her as a\n\u201chuge asset\u201d to the company.  The company vice president, testifying on her behalf, stated that she\n4\ncontinuously receives accolades from government customers.  Her company awarded her with one\n5\nof its most prestigious awards, the Customer Recognition Award, on two occasions between 2005\nand 2006.6\nApplicant has a history of financial problems. They began in 1994 when a difficult pregnancy\ncaused her to miss five months of work.  Although she received disability, it only constituted 60 per\n7\ncent of her income, and she fell behind on her car payments. Shortly thereafter, she arranged for the\ncar to be voluntarily repossessed.8\nIn 1995, Applicant lent $1,500 to a friend who was being prosecuted for writing bad checks.9\nThe friend failed to pay the loan. Also, she gained access to Applicant\u2019s social security number, and\nstole her identity, using it to open a phone account, and generating a $1,700 bill.  Applicant\n10\nultimately was unsuccessful in challenging the phone bill, and had to pay it.\nIn 1996, Applicant cosigned a loan for her boyfriend. She became responsible for payments\nafter he failed to make them.  She struggled to make the payments, and ultimately grew delinquent\n11\non both her boyfriend\u2019s car note, and her own car note.  Ultimately, both were repossessed.\n12\n\nExhibits 20a and 20b, Court Records, dated June 2, 1998 and June 29, 1998, respectively.\n13\nExhibit 20c, Payment Receipt, dated October 20, 1998.\n14\nTr. 43.\n15\nId.\n16\nTr. 94.\n17\nTr. 95; Exhibit 19, Court Records, dated September 3, 2003.\n18\nExhibit 9, U.S. Bankruptcy Court Records; discharge entered December 23, 1999.\n19\nId.\n20\nSee Exhibit 9, Schedule F at 20 and 22.\n21\nExhibit 3, at 5.\n22\nTr. 114; Exhibit 14, Excerpt from Credit Bureau Report showing zero balance as of December 2006.\n23\nExhibit 18c, Receipt, dated August 29, 2000.\n24\n4\nIn June 1998, Applicant bounced a check to a convenience store in the amount of $35.\n(Subparagraph 1.s).  She satisfied it four months later.\n13\n14\nIn approximately 1998, Applicant underwent a sterilization procedure.  It was unsuccessful,\n15\nand she became pregnant with her second child in 1999. The child\u2019s health was fragile at birth,\nrequiring two months of inpatient monitoring in a hospital intensive care unit, and generating costly\nmedical bills.16\nIn July 1999, Applicant wrote a check to a dentist for approximately $116 with insufficient\nfunds. (Subparagraph 1.r) She neither received notice from her bank at the time nor the dentist\u2019s\noffice, because she moved shortly after writing the check.  During the course of a routine police stop\n17\nin 2003, the officer performed a record\u2019s check, and discovered the misdemeanor charge. Applicant\npaid it, whereupon it was nolle prossed.18\nIn August 1999, Applicant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy (subparagraph 1.a).  The\n19\nbankruptcy court discharged her debts the following December.  The discharged debts exceeded\n20\n$65,000. Approximately $30,000 constituted the deficiencies remaining from the repossession of her\ncar and her boyfriend\u2019s car.21\nApplicant continued to struggle with her finances after the bankruptcy discharge. In February\n2000, she purchased another car.  She grew behind on payments, and returned it to the dealer,\n22\nleading to its voluntary repossession in January 2001. (Subparagraph 1.m) Approximately five\nmonths later, she negotiated a settlement of $1200, and satisfied it.23\nIn June 2000, Applicant bounced a check to a gas station (Subparagraph 1.q). She paid it in\nAugust 2000.24\n\nExhibit B, State Department of Social Services Payment Chronology, dated May 16, 2007\n25\nThe incarceration did not relate to his failure to pay child support.\n26\nExhibit B, dated May 16, 2007.\n27\nLetter of Friend, dated February 23, 2007, as listed in Answer at 80.\n28\nExhibits 16a and 16b, Court Records, dated January 2, 2001 and July 11, 2001, respectively.\n29\nTr. 145.\n30\nId.\n31\nTr. 119.\n32\nId.\n33\nCredit Bureau Report Excerpt, date February 21, 2007, as included in Answer at 79.\n34\nLetter from Creditor, dated February 15, 2007, as listed in Answer at 78.\n35\nTr. 115.\n36\nTr. 116.\n37\n5\nIn July 2000, Applicant obtained a child support order against her ex-boyfriend which he\nfailed to pay.  In 2001, he was incarcerated, and spent the next five years in prison.  She received\n25\n26\nno child support payments during that time. Currently, he owes approximately $54,000 of delinquent\nchild support payments.27\nIn November 2000, a friend loaned Applicant $400. When she attempted to repay the loan,\nshe wrote a check that bounced. Her friend pressed charges, then withdrew them after Applicant paid\nher (subparagraph 1.p).28\nIn January 2001, Applicant was charged with writing a check with insufficient funds after\nbouncing a $13 check to a grocery store (subparagraph 1.o). She was found not guilty, after she\npresented evidence that she paid it before the hearing.29\nIn 2002, Applicant underwent a major surgical procedure.  She was out of work for 8 weeks\n30\nwhile recuperating.31\nBy March 2006, Applicant had accrued approximately $8,700 of post-bankruptcy\ndelinquencies. In April 2006, she got a raise.  By September 2006, Applicant\u2019s ex-boyfriend had\n32\nleft prison and begun making child support payments.  In December 2006, she satisfied the\n33\ndelinquent medical bill listed in subparagraph 1.g. Also that month, she negotiated a settlement with\n34\nthe creditor listed in 1.e, and satisfied it for $884.35\nApplicant was able to make these lump sum payments with her parents\u2019 help. They have\ngifted her a total of $5,000 since 2005.  She also used money from this gift to pay debts that were\n36\nthe subject of the DSS investigation, but not listed in the SOR.37\n\nTr. 68-69.\n38\nTr. 125-130. Applicant\u2019s calculations do not include income from child support, which has remained sporadic.\n39\nExhibit 1 at 28.\n40\n6\nIn January 2007, Applicant began researching financial counseling services. She retained one\nthe following month. With the help of a counselor, she developed a payment plan that consolidated\nall the remaining SOR debts (subparagraphs 1.b through 1.d, 1.f, and 1.h through 1.l). Under the\nplan, she pays the counseling agency $264 monthly, whereupon, the agency distributes a portion of\nthe payment to each creditor. Applicant has been making payments since March 2007.\nIn February 2007, Applicant obtained a part-time job. She works 16 hours per week.  In\n38\nApril 2007, she obtained another raise. Currently, after expenses, Applicant has $636 remaining after\nexpenses, monthly.  She has two credit cards, and pays their respective balances in their entirety\n39\neach month. She has opened savings accounts for both children, and maintains $1,300 in her own\nsavings account. At the hearing, the vice president of her company testified that she \u201cabsolutely\u201d will\nreceive a five to six per cent raise in October 2007.\nApplicant completed a security clearance application in October 2005. In response to Section\n29 (Public Record Civil Actions    In the last 7 years, have you been a party to any public record\ncivil court actions not listed elsewhere on this form?), she did not disclose a number of public record\ncivil actions as listed in subparagraph 2.b. She asserts that these omissions were unintentional. All\nof the civil actions related to her finances. Elsewhere on the application, she listed her 1999\nbankruptcy, a garnishment, and a judgment. Also, she answered \u201cYes\u201d in response to Question 27b.\n(In the last 7 years, have you had your wages garnished or had any property repossessed for any\nreason?), and Section 28b. (Are you currently over 90 days delinquent on any debt(s)?). Also, she\nelaborated at length about her financial problems in the \u201cAdditional Comments\u201d section of the\nsecurity clearance application.40\nPOLICIES\nThe adjudicative guidelines, as revised December 29, 2005, and implemented September 1,\n2006, apply to the analysis of this case. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each\nguideline, they are divided into those that may be considered in deciding whether to deny or revoke\nan individual\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information (disqualifying conditions) and those\nthat may be considered in deciding whether to grant an individual\u2019s eligibility for access to classified\ninformation (mitigating conditions).\nBecause the entire process is a scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person\nconcept,\u201d all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and\nunfavorable, should be considered in making a meaningful decision. Specifically these are: (1) the\nnature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances; (2) the frequency and recency\nof the conduct; (3) the age of the applicant; (4) the motivation of the applicant, and the extent to\nwhich the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the\nconsequences; (5) the absence or presence of rehabilitation; and (6) the probability that the\ncircumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future.\n\nSee generally, Directive, Sec. 2.3, Sec. 2.5.3, Sec. 3.2, and Sec. 4.2.\n41\n7\nThe following adjudicative guidelines are raised:\nGuideline F - Financial Considerations: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s\nmeans, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control,\nlack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can\nraise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information.\nGuideline E - Personal Conduct: Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of\ncandor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid\nanswers during the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with\nthe security clearance process.\nConditions pertaining to this adjudicative guideline that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security concerns, are set forth and discussed\nin the conclusions below.\nSince the protection of national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision\nin each case must be reached by applying the standard that the issuance of the clearance is \u201cclearly\nconsistent with the national interest.\u201d   In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those\n41\nconclusions that are based on the evidence contained in the record.\nThe Government is responsible for presenting evidence to establish facts in the SOR that\nhave been controverted. The applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain,\nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by the Government, and has the\nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\nCONCLUSIONS\nFinancial Considerations\nApplicant\u2019s history of financial problems trigger the application of Financial Considerations\nDisqualifying Conditions (FC DC) 19(a): inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts, FC DC 19(c):\na history of not meeting financial obligations, and FC DC 19(e): consistent spending beyond one\u2019s\nmeans, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-\nto-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis. Applicant experienced a difficult pregnancy in\n1994, a child born extremely premature in 1998, and a serious medical procedure in 2002. All\ngenerated costly medical bills, and rendered her temporarily unable to work. These problems were\nexacerbated by Applicant\u2019s problems with the father of her children. While they were together, he\nseldom earned a steady income to help with the family finances. After they separated, he did not pay\nchild support.\n\n8\nApplicant\u2019s financial problems cannot solely be contributed to her health and her ex-\nboyfriend. A number of bad decisions, such as loaning money to a friend who was facing prosecution\nfor writing bad checks, co-signing a loan for her ex-boyfriend, and buying a car three months after\ngetting a bankruptcy discharge also contributed. Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition (FC\nMC) 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s\ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death,\ndivorce, or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances, does not\napply.\nIn the past 7 months, Applicant has satisfied several debts, organized a payment plan with\nthe help of a financial counselor, and obtained a part-time job to generate extra income to pay her\ndebts. Currently, she has ample income to pay her remaining debts, and will soon be getting a raise\nthat will further ensure her ability to satisfy the delinquencies. FC MC 20(c): the person has received\nor is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is\nbeing resolved or is under control, and FC MC 20(d): the individual initiated a good-faith effort to\nrepay overdue creditors otherwise resolve debts apply. Applicant has mitigated the financial\nconsiderations security concern.\nPersonal Conduct\nApplicant demonstrated questionable judgment when she wrote a series of bad checks\nbetween 1999 and 2002. Her propensity to write bad checks during this time was more indicative\nof financial hardship than dishonesty. Moreover, there is no evidence that she has written a bad\ncheck in more than four years. She has mitigated the personal conduct security concern with respect\nto the bad checks.\nApplicant\u2019s omission of several public record court cases from Question 29 of the security\nclearance application raises the issue of whether Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC)\n16 (a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel\nsecurity questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations,\ndetermine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities, applies.\nAll of the omissions involve court cases related to Applicant\u2019s troubled finances. She\nelaborated upon her financial condition in a candid and comprehensive manner elsewhere on the\nsecurity clearance application. In this context, I conclude her failure to list the court actions, as stated\nin the SOR, does not constitute intentional falsification. PC DC 16 (a) does not apply. Applicant has\nmitigated the personal conduct security concerns.\nWhole Person Concept\nApplicant has been gradually regaining control of her finances for the past 7 months. When\nconsidered alone, this does not mitigate the security concern in light of the length of time she has had\nfinancial problems, and their recurrence after a 2001 discharge. Applicant\u2019s current effort toward\nimproving her finances have included working with a financial counselor, and generating extra\nincome through obtaining a part-time job. Also, she has been able to make payments toward debt\nreduction while simultaneously investing in three savings\u2019 accounts. \n\n9\nI was particularly impressed with the fact that Applicant has been successfully reducing her\ndelinquencies while taking college courses, raising two children by herself, executing her full-time\njob responsibilities in an exemplary manner, and working at a part-time job. Consequently, the\nconcern generated by the recurrence of delinquencies after the bankruptcy discharge is outweighed\nby the fortitude that she has demonstrated in rehabilitating her finances. Considering these factors\nin light of the whole-person concept, particularly with respect to her maturity, the presence of\nrehabilitation, and the minimal potential for coercion, I conclude she has mitigated the security\nconcern. Clearance is granted. \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nParagraph 1 \u2013 Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.s:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2 - Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

BRESLIN\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nEmilio Jaksetic, Esq. Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\n\n2\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant is an employee of a defense contractor.  Applicant had three off-duty, alcohol-\nrelated incidents, specifically: driving under the influence of alcohol in 1997; driving under the\ninfluence of alcohol in 2002; and negligent driving after consuming alcohol in 2003.  She completed\na court-ordered alcohol treatment program, but she did not present any evidence of a favorable\nprognosis or an established pattern of responsible drinking.  Considering all the evidence, I conclude\nApplicant has not met her burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant her a security clearance.  Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn November 18, 2004, Applicant submitted an application for a security clearance.  The\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance\nfor Applicant under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry\n(Feb. 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (Jan. 2, 1992) (the \u201cDirective\u201d), as amended; and the new\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and implemented\nby the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006.  On February 28, 2007, DOHA issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision: security concerns raised under the\nDirective, Guideline G, Alcohol Consumption.  \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on April 9, 2007.  She elected to have the matter\ndecided without a hearing.\nDepartment Counsel submitted the government\u2019s case in a File of Relevant Material (FORM)\ndated May 22, 2007.  On May 24, 2007, Department Counsel mailed a complete copy of the FORM\nto Applicant, along with notice of her opportunity to file objections and submit material to refute,\nextenuate, or mitigate the potentially disqualifying conditions.  On June 14, 2007, Applicant received\nthe FORM.  She did not submit any additional materials within the specified 30-day period.  The\ncase was assigned to me on August 15, 2007. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant denied the allegation in \u00b6 1.a, and admitted the remaining allegations in the SOR.\n(Item 3.)  Those admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact.  After a complete and\nthorough review of the evidence in the record, I make the following additional findings of fact.\nApplicant is 55 years old.  (Item 4 at 1.)  She is a janitor for a defense contractor.  (Id. at 2.)\nShe has two adult children, and is currently separated from her second husband.  (Id. at 3-4.) \nPolice officers arrested Applicant in August 1997 and charged her with Driving Under the\nInfluence.  (Item 3 at 1; Item 5 at 3.)  She pleaded guilty to the charge.  The court sentenced her to\n12 months probation and ordered her to attend Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) classes.  (Item 3 at 1.)\nApplicant attended the required treatment classes.  (Item 5 at 2.) \n\n3\nOn August 24, 2002, local police officers arrested Applicant and charged her with operating\na motor vehicle with a blood-alcohol content more than .08%, and driving, or attempting to drive,\nwhile under the influence of alcohol.  (Item 3 at 1-2.)  The court found her guilty of the offense.  Her\nsentence included 18 months probation, and she was required to install an interlock device on her\nvehicle for 12 months.  (Item 3 at 2.)  Complying with the court-order, Applicant began an intensive,\n36-week, alcohol counseling program in about September 2002.  (Item 3 at 2; Item 5 at 2.)  \nIn early 2003, authorities arrested her for Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol.  (Id.)  She\nhad consumed alcohol before driving that day.  The authorities later charged her with the lesser\noffense of Negligent Driving.  (Id.)  The case was resolved when the Motor Vehicle Administration\nordered her to install an interlock device for an additional six months and to continue alcohol\ncounseling.  (Id.)  \nShe completed the court-ordered program in about June 2003.  Applicant did not provide\nevidence of successful rehabilitation, or a favorable prognosis by a treating health-care provider.\nApplicant admits that she continues to consume alcohol on a monthly basis, that she drinks\nto intoxication occasionally, and that she last drank to the point of intoxication in November 2006.\n(Item 5 at 1.)  She no longer attends meetings of AA or a similar organization, nor does she take\nmedication to help her abstain from alcohol.  (Id.)  \nPOLICIES\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national\nsecurity and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position \u2026\nthat will give that person access to such information.\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 527 (1988).  In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry\n(Feb. 20, 1960), the President set out guidelines and procedures for safeguarding classified\ninformation within the executive branch. \nTo be eligible for a security clearance, an applicant must meet the security guidelines\ncontained in the Directive.  Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel security guidelines, as\nwell as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions under each guideline.  Conditions that\ncould raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate\nsecurity concerns pertaining to this adjudicative guideline, are set forth and discussed in the\nconclusions below.\n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.\u201d  (AG, \u00b6 2.)  An\nadministrative judge must apply the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d and consider and carefully weigh the\navailable, reliable information about the person.  (Id.)  An administrative judge should consider the\nfollowing factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of\nthe conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral\nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\n\n4\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  (Id.) \nInitially, the government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR\nthat disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to classified\ninformation.  (Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.14.)  Thereafter, the applicant is responsible for presenting evidence\nto rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  (Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.15.)  An applicant \u201chas the\nultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or\ncontinue his security clearance.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).  \u201cAny\ndoubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will\nbe resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  (Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.2.)\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the\ngovernment.  The government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those\nindividuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  The decision to deny an individual\na security clearance is not a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  (Exec. Ord. 10865, \u00a7\n7.)  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has\nestablished for issuing a clearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI considered carefully all the facts in evidence and the legal standards discussed above.  I\nreach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the SOR.\nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nParagraph 21 of the new adjudicative guidelines explains the security concerns relating to\nalcohol consumption.  \u201cExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable\njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability\nand trustworthiness.\u201d  (AG, \u00b6 21.)  \nThe adjudicative guidelines set out some potentially disqualifying conditions that could raise\nsecurity concerns.  Under \u00b6 22(a), it may be disqualifying where the evidence reveals \u201calcohol-\nrelated incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence . . . regardless of\nwhether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent.\u201d  The evidence\nreveals three alcohol-related incidents away from work: driving under the influence of alcohol in\n1997; driving under the influence of alcohol in 2002; and negligent driving after consuming alcohol\nin 2003.  The available evidence raises this potentially disqualifying condition. \nParagraph 22(c) may arise where there is evidence of \u201chabitual or binge consumption of\nalcohol to the point of impaired judgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an\nalcohol abuser or alcohol dependent.\u201d  The available evidence indicates Applicant\u2019s excessive use\nof alcohol is sporadic\u2013not habitual.  Similarly, the evidence does not establish that her alcohol intake\nrises to the level of \u201cbinge consumption.\u201d  I conclude the evidence does not raise this potentially\ndisqualifying condition.\n\n5\nThe guidelines also set out conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising because\nof alcohol consumption.  Paragraph 23(a) is a factor for consideration where, \nso much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it happened under\nsuch unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\nThe available evidence shows alcohol consumption excessive enough to generate security concerns\nbetween about 1997 and 2003\u2013a period of about six years.  By comparison, it has only been about\nfour years since her last off-duty alcohol related incident, and less than one year since her last\nreported incident of intoxication.  I am not persuaded that a sufficient amount of time has passed to\nraise this potentially mitigating factor.  Furthermore, Applicant had off-duty alcohol-related incidents\non several occasions over several years.  I conclude the behavior is not \u201cinfrequent,\u201d nor has\nApplicant presented any evidence indicating the behavior is unlikely to recur.  I conclude this\npotentially mitigating condition does not apply.\nUnder \u00b623(b), it may be mitigating where \u201cthe individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism\nor issues of alcohol abuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has\nestablished a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or responsible use (if an alcohol abuser).\u201d\nApplicant admitted the specific allegations regarding off-duty, alcohol-related incidents, but she did\nnot address the larger question of whether she is alcohol dependent or an alcohol abuser.  She\nindicated she attended the 36-week alcohol treatment program, but did not provide evidence\nindicating she has established a pattern of responsible drinking.  The available evidence does not\nraise this potentially mitigating condition.\nParagraph 23(d) provides that security concerns may be mitigated where:\nthe individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient counseling or\nrehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has demonstrated a clear and\nestablished pattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with\ntreatment recommendations, such as participation in meetings of Alcoholics\nAnonymous or a similar organization and has received a favorable prognosis by a\nduly qualified medical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff\nmember of a recognized alcohol treatment program.\nAs noted above, Applicant completed the court-ordered treatment program, but she did not provide\nproof that she established a pattern of modified consumption or that she received a favorable\nprognosis from a qualified care provider.  This potentially mitigating condition is not a factor for\nconsideration.  \nWhole Person Concept\nI considered carefully all the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in this case\nin light of the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept, keeping in mind that any doubt as to whether access to\nclassified information is clearly consistent with national security must be resolved in favor of\nnational security.  I considered the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct.  Applicant\u2019s\nadmissions reveal a pattern of excessive alcohol consumption, covering a period of about six years\n\n6\nwhen she was between about 46 and 52 years old.  Apparently she completed an alcohol treatment\nprogram, but she did not present any evidence of a favorable prognosis or an established pattern of\nresponsible drinking.  For this reason, I cannot assess the extent of her rehabilitation of another\npertinent behavioral change, or determine the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  Considering\nall the evidence, I conclude Applicant has not met her burden of demonstrating that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant her a security clearance. \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nMy conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline H:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nClearance is denied.\nMichael J.

He explained he thought he was taking a legal avenue in filing bankruptcy.  As Applicant had\nadmitted this allegation, I overruled his objection and admitted Exhibit 6 into evidence.  (Exhibit 6; TR 16-\n17) He did not object to Exhibit 7, also records from the U.S. Bankruptcy Court from his 2000 filing.\n2\nApplicant failed to mitigate security concerns over his continuing and ongoing financial\nproblems, including a repossession of his car because of gambling debts.  While he consulted two\nresources to help him develop a plan to resolve his problems, he provided no evidence that he has\npaid any of his outstanding debts other than an IRS lien being paid through wage garnishments.\nWhile he has taken some steps to reform his conduct and stated an intent to resolve his debts, he\nfailed to demonstrate sufficient positive changes in behavior.  Consequently, security concerns\nremain over finances.  Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR)\nto the Applicant on December 29, 2006.  The SOR detailed reasons why the Government could not\nmake the preliminary positive finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nor continue a security clearance for the Applicant.   The SOR alleged specific concerns over\n1\nFinancial Considerations (Guideline F) in paragraph 1 based on the revised Adjudicative Guidelines2\nissued on December 29, 2005, and implemented by the Department of Defense, to be effective\nSeptember 1, 2006.  Applicant requested and was granted an extension of time to file his Answer;\nhe responded to these SOR allegations in a notarized Answer received on March 7, 2007.  He\nrequested a hearing. \nDepartment Counsel on March 21, 2007, indicated the case was ready to proceed.  The matter\nwas assigned to me on March 28, 2007. Subsequently, a mutually convenient date for hearing was\nagreed to; and a Notice of Hearing, issued on March 30, 2007, set the matter for April 17, 2007, at\na location near where Applicant works and lives.\n \nAt the hearing the Government offered seven exhibits  (Exhibit 1-7: TR 10-17) which were\nadmitted  into evidence. Applicant testified, but called no witnesses.   Applicant requested five to\n3\nsix months to clear up his debts.  (TR 30)  However, I granted Applicant three weeks to submit\nadditional evidence to which the Government consented;  and Department Counsel had one week\nto review it.  (TR 31-33, 41-42, 79, 88)  \nApplicant submitted Exhibits A, a debt payment schedule on May 3, 2007.  On May 9,\n2007, Government\u2019s counsel indicated no objection; so the document was admitted into evidence\nand the record closed.  The transcript (TR) was received on April 26, 2007.\n\n       He was allowed additional time to submit letters of reference or evaluations, but did not submit any such\n4\nevidence.  (TR 40-41)\n3\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due\nconsideration of that evidence, I make the following Findings of Fact:\nApplicant, 48 years old, who has worked for a defense contractor  from October 2002 to\n4\npresent, is a systems analyst.  He now earns $76,000 annually.  He completed a Security Clearance\nApplication (SF 86) to obtain a security clearance in October 2004.  Previously, he worked as a\nnetwork administrator for another employer from January 2000 to October 2002 in a different\ngeographic location. From February 1996 to January 2001 he was a network administrator at\nanother company; and he earned $42,000. From January 2002 to January 2003 he took classes at\nan online university, but received no degree.  (Exhibits 1, 2; TR 39-40; 42-47)  Applicant has not\nserved in the military.  (Exhibit 1) He was married in 1990 but divorced in January 2000; he has\nthree children born in 1975, 1978 and 1980.  (Exhibit 1; TR 42-43) He currently has no one\nfinancially dependent on him.  (TR 47)\nFinances\nApplicant explained that when he was married and even when he was not married, he \u201cjust\nran into some tough times.\u201d  He explained he was living beyond his means.  Things \u201ckept going\ndownhill\u201d for him.  He has an intent to take care of his debts.  (TR 19; 48-50)  He  has twice filed\nfor Chapter 7 bankruptcy as he was following the advice of lawyers.  In 1993 he had debts of over\n$47,000 discharged (SOR \u00b61.a.); in 2000 he had debts totaling over $100,000 discharged after his\ndivorce, including a house purchased for $70,000 that was foreclosed (SOR \u00b61.b.).  (Answer;\nExhibits 6, 7; TR 20-22; 50-52)  \nSince his 2000 bankruptcy, Applicant admitted he developed new debts from the misuse\nof credit cards.  (TR 23)  He also has gone to casinos, but claims he does not use his credit card\nat casinos.  Nonetheless, he admitted he was unable to pay his car payments because of his losses\nat the casino of approximately $5,000 to $6,000 in 2006 (SOR 1.u.).  He lost $800 in 2007.  In\nNovember 2006 Applicant consulted a credit repair corporation to address his credit issues as his\ncurrent indebtedness is over $23,000 to 25 creditors.  Even though he paid them an initial fee of\n$150 and subsequently paid them $300, he did not offer any evidence of how they helped to contest\nor resolve any of his debts.  (Exhibit 2; TR 29-30, 36; 60-61; 67-68; 74-76) While he denied\nseveral of his debts, he never documented any of his dispute with the creditors.  (TR 23)  \nRecently, he contacted another individual to help him resolve his debt issues, but he\nprovided no documentation of progress from those efforts except for a plan to make gradual\npayments to fifteen of those creditors.  (TR 28, 36-37; 69-70; Exhibit A)  He has never taken any\nclasses on financing or budgeting. (TR 76)  He has no savings. (TR 79)   While he submitted a plan\nto pay 15 of the debts in May 2007, he submitted no evidence that, in fact, he had made any\npayments on the debts in his payment schedule.  (Exhibit A) He provided no evidence that he has\n\n4\nresolved any of the debts alleged in the SOR which are document on three credit reports from\n2005, 2006, 2007.  \nThe current status of these debts is as follows:\nSOR \u00b6\nTYPE OF DEBT (date)\nAMOUNT\nCURRENT STATUS\n1.c.\nCollection account for\ntelephone (2000)\n$19.00\nUnpaid.

Applicant\u2019s gross monthly pay is $3,200 per month; his current monthly rent\nis $510 and he pays $50 in utilities. (TR 62-67)  He has no car and no cable expenses.  (TR 65)\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider in evaluating an\nindividual's security eligibility which  are divided into conditions that could raise a security\nconcern and may be disqualifying and conditions that could mitigate security concerns.  In deciding\nwhether to grant or continue an individual's access to classified information, the mere presence or\nabsence of any adjudication policy condition is not decisive.  Based on a consideration of the\nevidence as a whole in evaluating this case, I weighed these relevant Revised Adjudication\nGuidelines:\nGuideline F:  Financial Considerations\n18. The Concern.  Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial\nobligations may indicate poor self-control, clack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules\nand regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness\nand ability to protect classified information.  An individual who is financially overextended is at\nrisk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it\nmay lead to financial crimes including espionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known\nsources of income is also a security concern.  It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable\ncriminal acts.\n \nThe responsibility for producing evidence initially falls on the Government to demonstrate\nthat it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant's access to\nclassified information.  Then the Applicant presents evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate in order  to overcome the doubts raised by the Government, and to demonstrate\npersuasively that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the clearance.\nUnder the provisions of Executive Order 10865, as amended, and the Directive, a decision to grant\nor continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only after an affirmative finding that to\ndo so is clearly consistent with the national interest. In reaching the fair and impartial overall\ncommon sense determination, the Administrative Judge may  draw only those inferences and\nconclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically provides industrial security clearance\ndecisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to\nthe loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is\nnot necessarily a determination as to the allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism of an applicant.  It is\n5\nmerely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the\nSecretary of Defense have established for issuing a security clearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n       20(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that\n6\nit is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment.  \n8\nFinancial Considerations\n     \nThe government provided substantial evidence of Applicant\u2019s financial problems reflected\nnot only by his having discharged substantial debts under Chapter 7 bankruptcy filings in 1993 and\nin 2000, but also by his continuing pattern of accumulating substantial debts that has persisted.\nHe admitted his gambling debts of $5,000 to $6,000 contributed to his car being repossessed.   In\n2007 he had lost an estimated $800 through gambling. Consequently, Financial Considerations\nDisqualifying Condition (DC), AG \u00b6 19(a), (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts), DC, AG\n\u00b6 19(c), (a history of not meeting financial obligations), and  AG \u00b6 19(i), (compulsive or addictive\ngambling as indicated by unsuccessful attempt to stop gambling. . . . borrowing money to fund\ngambling or pay gambling debts, family conflict or other problems caused by gambling) apply. \nWith the government\u2019s case established, the burden shifted to Applicant to present evidence\nof refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against him.  While he has a good\nincome and limited expenses, he has made no demonstrable efforts to resolve his credit problems\nwhich continue to raise security concerns.  While he consulted two different sources for help with\ncredit counseling, he has not utilized their expertise to document either that he has contested or\npaid any of these numerous debts.  The only debt being paid is an IRS lien through wage\ngarnishment where he still owes the IRS money.  Consequently, Applicant has not established a\ncase in mitigation.  For example, he provided no evidence under Mitigating Condition (MC) AG\n\u00b6 20(c), (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear\nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control). Neither was there substantial\nmitigating evidence under AG \u00b6 20(b), (the conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical\nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation) and the individual acted responsibly under the\ncircumstances).  While his divorce might be a mitigating factor in the 2000 bankruptcy, he has\nbeen single since then and continued to accumulate debt.   Since, he continues to gamble in 2007\nand sustain losses, AG \u00b6 20(a)  cannot apply as the financially irresponsible behavior continues.\n6\nWhile he stated an intent to pay some debts and developed a plan for how he might pay\ncertain debts over the next six months, Applicant has not demonstrated that he has paid even one\ndebt, large or small, except for his IRS garnishment payments.  Thus, he fails to meet  AG \u00b6 20(d),\n(the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts).\nWhile he has a professional position with a good income, his failure to resolve his debts and his\ncontinuing to gamble creates an ongoing security concern.  \nWhole Person Analysis\nHaving considered both the record and Applicant in light of the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept,\nI conclude he is an earnest person who has struggled with reforming his financial practices; but he\n\n9\nhas not made sufficient progress even after he has stated an intent to do so.  While the 1993 and\n2000 bankruptcies were a legal method of dealing with the financial delinquencies, he\nsubsequently failed to change his practices and since 2000 has accumulated over $20,000 in debt\nto over two dozen creditors despite a current income of $76,000 and a current monthly rental of\n$510.  He has developed no budget and does not understand where his money goes.  His failure\nto address the ongoing debt, in part created from gambling, continues to raise security concerns.\nThe potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress is high even though he has an\nemployment history since 2002. In sum, the likelihood of new debts and related problems is high.\nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and\ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude he has failed to mitigate the security\nconcerns pertaining to financial considerations.  I rule against  Applicant on subparagraphs 1.a.\nthrough 1.y. under SOR Paragraph 1.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nAfter reviewing the allegations of the SOR in the context of the Adjudicative Guidelines\nin Enclosure 2 and the factors set forth under the Adjudicative Process section, I make the\nfollowing formal findings:\nParagraph 1. Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a through 1.y.\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.\nClearance is denied.\nKathryn Moen Braeman\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "FINDINGS OF FACT The Applicant is 47, single, and has a high school diploma. He is employed by a defense contractor as a technician, and he seeks to obtain a DoD security clearance in connection with his employment in the defense sector. The Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, based upon the allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR). The following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR. They are based on the Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the exhibits and the live testimony. Paragraph 1(Guideline J - Criminal conduct). The Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has engaged in criminal acts. In May 2001 the Applicant was driving the car of a friend (Mr. X). During a traffic stop by police, Mr. X\u2019s car was searched and drugs were found in the possession of Mr. X and also in the possession of the Applicant. The Applicant was arrested and charged with felony counts of Possession and Transportation of Narcotics or Controlled Substances and a misdemeanor count of Possession of Over 1 Ounce of Marijuana. The Applicant pled Nolo Contendere to the third count and the felony counts were dismissed. He was sentenced to, and completed, an 18 month diversion 3 program. The case against the Applicant was dismissed as a result of his successful completion of the diversion program. (Transcript at 19-22, 32-34; Government Exhibit 3; Applicant\u2019s Exhibit C.) ",

The Applicant\nremains on probation for the second incident.  In addition, the Applicant remains personally involved\n\n2\nwith the other participant in both criminal incidents.  Insufficient mitigation is shown to overcome\nthe evidence of poor judgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness.  Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn November 28, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 (as amended) and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated\nJanuary 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why\nDOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and\nrecommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied\nor revoked.\nThe Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on January 18, 2007, and requested a hearing.\nThe case was originally assigned to another Administrative Judge on February 13, 2007.  The case\nwas reassigned to me on February 21, 2007, and a Notice of Hearing was issued on February 27,\n2007.\nA hearing was held on March 21, 2007, at which the Government presented three\ndocumentary exhibits.  Testimony was taken from the Applicant, who also submitted one exhibit.\nThe transcript was received on March 30, 2007. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe Applicant is 47, single, and has a high school diploma.  He is employed by a defense\ncontractor as a technician, and he seeks to obtain a DoD security clearance in connection with his\nemployment in the defense sector.\nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, based upon the\nallegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The following findings of fact are entered\nas to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR.  They are based on the Applicant's Answer to the\nSOR, the exhibits and the live testimony.\nParagraph 1(Guideline J - Criminal conduct).  The Government alleges in this paragraph that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he has engaged in criminal acts.\nIn May 2001 the Applicant was driving the car of a friend (Mr. X).  During a traffic stop by\npolice, Mr. X\u2019s car was searched and drugs were found in the possession of Mr. X and also in the\npossession of the Applicant.  The Applicant was arrested and charged with felony counts of\nPossession and Transportation of Narcotics or Controlled Substances and a misdemeanor count of\nPossession of Over 1 Ounce of Marijuana.  The Applicant pled Nolo Contendere to the third count\nand the felony counts were dismissed.  He was sentenced to, and completed, an 18 month diversion\n\n3\nprogram.  The case against the Applicant was dismissed as a result of his successful completion of\nthe diversion program.  (Transcript at 19-22, 32-34;  Government Exhibit 3; Applicant\u2019s Exhibit C.)\nThe Applicant remained friends with Mr. X even after the 2001 incident.  Some time later\nMr. X was not able to purchase an automobile because of his bad credit.  The Applicant obtained an\nautomobile loan and purchased a car for Mr. X\u2019s use.  In 2004 Mr. X informed the Applicant that\nthe car had been stolen.  Since the car was licensed in the Applicant\u2019s name, he was required to file\na police report concerning the stolen automobile.  In reality, the automobile had not been stolen by\nstrangers, but by Mr. X himself.  \nThe police and the insurance company discovered Mr. X\u2019s fraud and he was arrested for\nGrand Theft - Auto.  Because the Applicant had filed a false police report, albeit unknowingly, he\nwas arrested for Falsely Reporting A Crime and being a Principal Party to a Crime.  The first count\nwas dismissed and the Applicant plead guilty to Count 2.  He was sentenced to three years probation\nand to pay a fine.  As of the date of the hearing, the Applicant continued to be on probation.\n(Transcript at 22-29, 34-38.)\nThe Applicant has known Mr. X since 1987.  Except when he is in jail, Mr. X has lived with\nthe Applicant and the Applicant\u2019s sister since 2000.  The Applicant testified that, without the\ngenerosity of the Applicant, Mr. X would be homeless.  (Transcript at 46-48.)  At one point in his\ntestimony, the Applicant stated that Mr. X has changed as a person.  (Transcript at 41-42.)  Later,\nhowever, the Applicant stated:\nNo, I don\u2019t trust him [Mr. X].  And we do have new locks on the bedroom\ndoor - - my sister\u2019s bedroom door and her bathroom so nothing disappears.  There is\nnothing in my room to take; so, he is not taking anything from there.  Basically, it\u2019s\njust so he is not homeless.  (Transcript at 44.)\nPOLICIES\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  Accordingly, the Department of\nDefense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992 Directive, has set forth policy factors, which must be given\n\"binding\" consideration in making security clearance determinations.  These factors should be\nfollowed in every case according to the pertinent guideline.  However, the factors are neither\nautomatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative\nJudge's reliance on his own common sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature and\nthe ways of the world, in making a reasoned decision.  Because each security clearance case presents\nits own unique facts and circumstances, it cannot be assumed that these factors exhaust the realm\nof human experience, or apply equally in every case.  Based on the Findings of Fact set forth above,\nthe factors most applicable to the evaluation of this case will be set forth under CONCLUSIONS,\nbelow.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 18-19, \u201cIn evaluating the\nrelevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the [Administrative Judge] should consider the following\nfactors [General Factors]:\n\n4\n(1)\nThe nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct\n(2)\nThe circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation\n(3)\nThe frequency and recency of the conduct\n(4)\nThe individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\n(5)\nThe voluntariness of participation\n(6)\nThe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent\nbehavior changes\n(7)\nThe motivation for the conduct\n(8)\nThe potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\n(9)\nThe likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nThe eligibility guidelines established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics\nand conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question of whether it is \"clearly consistent\nwith the national interest\" to grant an Applicant's request for access to classified information.\nIn the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian\nworkers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information twenty-four hours a day.\nThe Government is therefore appropriately concerned where available information indicates that an\nApplicant for clearance may be involved in criminal acts that demonstrates poor judgement,\nuntrustworthiness or unreliability on the Applicant's part.\nThe DoD Directive states, \"Each adjudication is to be an overall common sense\ndetermination based upon consideration and assessment of all available information, both favorable\nand unfavorable, with particular emphasis placed on the seriousness, recency, frequency, and\nmotivation for the individual's conduct; the extent to which conduct was negligent, willful,\nvoluntary, or undertaken with the knowledge of the circumstances or consequences involved; and,\nto the extent that it can be estimated, the probability that conduct will or will not continue in the\nfuture.\"  The Administrative Judge can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have a\nreasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or\nconclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \"Any determination under this order...shall be\na determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the\nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\"\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n5\nIt is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding\nof a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant's conduct and the granting of a security\nclearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward\nwith evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the\nGovernment's case.  The Applicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant him a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving by substantial evidence that\nthe Applicant has been involved in two criminal offenses (Guideline J).\nThe Applicant, on the other hand, has not introduced persuasive evidence in rebuttal,\nexplanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome the Government's case against him.  The\nApplicant showed extremely poor judgment in being involved in two incidents of criminal activity,\nboth involving Mr. X.  This poor judgment continues to be shown by the Applicant in that he has\nallowed Mr. X, a known criminal who the Applicant does not trust, to live with him for several\nyears. \nThe following Disqualifying Conditions apply to the facts in this case: 31.(a) A single serious\ncrime or multiple lesser offenses; and 31.(d) Individual is currently on parole or probation.  None\nof the Mitigating Conditions apply, specifically because there is evidence, set forth above, that casts\ndoubt on the Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and good judgment.  In addition, under the\nparticular facts of this case, there is insufficient evidence of successful rehabilitation.\nI have also considered this case under the Whole Person concept.  Using the General Factors,\nI am also unable to find that the Applicant possesses the requisite good judgment, reliability and\ntrustworthiness required of security clearance holders.  I have particular concerns with Factors (6)\nThe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes, (8) The\npotential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress, and (9) The likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has failed to overcome the Government's\ninformation opposing his request for a security clearance.  Accordingly, the evidence supports a\nfinding against the Applicant as to the conclusionary allegations expressed in Paragraph 1 of the\nGovernment's Statement of Reasons. \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as required by\nParagraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1:\nAgainst the Applicant.\nSubparagraphs 1.a. and 1.b.: Against the Applicant.\n\n6\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.\nWilford H. Ross\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On December 28, 2006, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons1\n(SOR) detailing the basis for its decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline C (Foreign\nPreference) and Guideline B (Foreign Influence) of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued\non December 29, 2005, and implemented by the Department of Defense for SORs issued after\nSeptember 1, 2006. The revised guidelines were provided to Applicant when the SOR was issued.\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on January 31, 2007, and elected to have a hearing before\nan administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on April 5, 2007. A notice of hearing was\nissued on April 12, 2007, scheduling the hearing for May 2, 2007. The hearing was conducted as\nscheduled to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue\na security clearance for Applicant. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on May 10, 2007.\nRULINGS ON PROCEDURE AND EVIDENCE\nThe Government offered five exhibits that were marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1\nthrough 5, and admitted without objections.\nDepartment Counsel requested administrative notice be taken of the facts contained in\nHearing Exhibits (HE) XVI and XVII. The source documents for the facts are U.S. Department of\nState, Background Note: Israel, dated February 2007 (HE I); U.S. Department of State, Consular\nInformation Sheet: Israel, the West Bank and Gaza, dated February 8, 2006 (HE II); U.S. Department\nof State, Country Reports on Human Rights Practices - 2006: Israel and the occupied territories,\ndated March 6, 2007 (HE III); U.S. Department of State, Travel Warning: Israel, the West Bank and\nGaza dated January 17, 2007 (HE IV); Congressional Research Service, CRS Report for Congress,\nIsrael: Background and Relations with the United States, updated November 14, 2006 (HE V);\nOffice of the National Counterintelligence Executive, Annual Report to Congress on Foreign\nEconomic Collection and Industrial Espionage - 2005 (HE VI); National Counterintelligence Center,\nAnnual Report to Congress on Foreign Economic Collection and Industrial Espionage - 2000 (HE\nVII); Interagency OPSEC Support Staff, Intelligence Threat Handbook, select pages (HE VIII); U.S.\nDepartment of State, Background Note: China, dated January 2007 (HE IX); U.S. Department of\nState, Consular Information Sheet: China, dated March 19, 2007 (HE X); U.S. Department of State,\nCountry Reports on Human Rights Practices - 2006: China, dated March 6, 2007 (HE XI); U.S.\nHouse of Representatives Select Committee Report, U.S. National Strategy and Military/Commercial\nConcerns with the People\u2019s Republic of China, dated January 3, 1999 (HE XII); Interagency OPSEC\nSupport Staff, Intelligence Threat Handbook, select pages (HE XIII); U.S. Department of State,\nBackground Note: Hong Kong, dated March 2007 (HE XIV); and U.S. Department of State,\nConsular Information Sheet: Hong Kong SAR, dated August 1, 2006 (HE XV).\nI took administrative notice of the facts contained in HE I through VI, IX through XII, XIV\nand XV, as requested in HE XVI and XVII.

The record was left open to allow Applicant an\nopportunity to submit additional material. He did so in a timely manner. Applicant submitted his\nletter and three character letters, which were marked AE D through G, and admitted without\nobjections. Department Counsel\u2019s letter forwarding the three letters is marked HE XVIII.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the allegations in the SOR are incorporated herein. In addition,\nafter a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following\nfindings of fact.\nApplicant is a 35-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for his current\nemployer since 2005. He is married with two children. Applicant has a bachelor\u2019s degree from\ncollege.  \n2\nApplicant\u2019s father was born in Iraq. He is an Israeli citizen, with permanent residence status\nin the United States. Applicant\u2019s mother was born in Yemen. She was an Israeli citizen who became\na U.S. citizen. She maintained dual citizenship with Israel. Applicant has two younger brothers.\nApplicant, his two brothers, his wife, and his two children were all born in the United States.\nBecause his parents are Israeli citizens, Israel considered Applicant an Israeli citizen.  \n3\nApplicant\u2019s father and brother formerly lived and worked together for a company in China\nand Hong Kong. They both left the job and no longer do business or live in China or Hong Kong.4\nApplicant has extended family members in Israel, such as uncles and aunts. His parents told\nhim about 18 months ago that they intend at some point to move to Israel. Their projected date at that\ntime was about two years out. Since then, their plans have changed. Applicant\u2019s father has health\nissues and is not working. Applicant believes his parents would still like to retire to Israel at some\npoint, but they have no plans for the foreseeable future.5\nApplicant as a child with his family, and later as an adult, would visit extended family\nmembers in Israel every few years. He traveled to Israel in 1984, 1989, 1991, 1995, 1997, 2001, and\n2004. On all his trips from 1984 through 2001, Applicant traveled only with his U.S. passport. In\n2004, Applicant applied for and received an Israeli passport. Applicant used that passport on his\n\nApplicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 2.\n6\nTr. at 40-42.\n7\nTr. at 44; AE C.\n8\nTr. at 51-53.\n9\nTr. at 55-59.\n10\nTr. at 64.\n11\nAE E-G.\n12\n5\n2004 trip to Israel. The passport had an expiration date of August 2005. Applicant renewed the\npassport in August 2006. The passport now has an expiration date of 2014.6\nApplicant obtained the passport for convenience. When he entered Israel with his U.S.\npassport, he was questioned by the Israeli authorities as to why he had not served in the Israeli\nmilitary. Applicant estimated the most time this took was about 20 minutes. Applicant could have\ncontinued to travel to Israel on a U.S. passport and suffered only minor inconvenience.7\nOn April 26, 2007, Applicant gave his Israeli passport to his company\u2019s facility security\nofficer (FSO). The FSO certified that if Applicant requests the return of his Israeli passport, the FSO\nwill document the facts and circumstances surrounding the return by an entry in the Joint Personnel\nAdjudication System (JPAS).8\nApplicant testified he is willing to renounce his Israeli dual citizenship. He contacted the\nIsraeli Consulate to discuss what would be required to renounce his citizenship and/or relinquish his\npassport. He has done nothing further to follow up on his expressed willingness to renounce his\nIsraeli citizenship.  Applicant had planned on visiting Israel this summer. He testified if he was\n9\ngranted a clearance, and he was unable to enter Israel on his U.S. passport, he would forego any trips\nto Israel.  Applicant does not intend to ever move to Israel.\n10\n11\nCharacter letters on Applicant\u2019s behalf from supervisors, co-workers, and associates praise\nhim for his dedication, integrity, and commitment to work and family. He is described as a well\nrespected, honorable man who lives by his word, and a loyal citizen who takes pride in serving the\nU.S. Government in the role of a contractor. They recommend him for a security clearance.12\nIsrael is a parliamentary democracy in the middle east. The Israeli government generally\nrespected the human rights of its citizens, but there are some issues with respect to its treatment of\nPalestinian detainees, conditions in some detention and interrogation facilities, and discrimination\nagainst Israel\u2019s Arab citizens. The U.S. government issued a travel warning to U.S. citizens about\ntravel in Israel, the West Bank, and the Gaza Strip, dated January 17, 2007, noting its concerns about\nterrorist attacks in those areas targeting U.S. citizens. Israel and the United States participate in joint\nmilitary planning and combined exercises, and have collaborated on military research and weapons\ndevelopment. Commitment to Israel\u2019s security and well being has been a cornerstone of U.S. policy\nin the Middle East since Israel\u2019s creation in 1948, and the two countries are bound closely by historic\n\nHE I-VIII, XVI; GE 3-5.\n13\nDepartment of the Navy v.

The clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations\nshould err, if they must, on the side of denials.  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant\n17\nshould be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such\nsensitive information.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a\n18\ndetermination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not\nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a\nclearance.  \n19\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth potentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and\nmitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline. Additionally, each security clearance decision\nmust be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and\ncircumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the adjudicative process factors listed in the\nDirective and AG \u00b6 2(a).\nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those\nwhich would mitigate security concerns, are set forth and discussed in the conclusions section below.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nAugust 16, 2000 memorandum by Assistant Secretary of Defense for Command, Control, Communications,\n20\nand Intelligence, entitled \u201cGuidance to DoD Central Adjudication Facilities (CAF) Clarifying the Application of the\nForeign Preference Adjudicative Guideline\u201d; ISCR Case No. 03-10380 (App. Bd. Jan. 6, 2006).\n7\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards discussed above.\nI reach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the SOR.\nGuideline C, Foreign Preference\nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over\nthe United States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are\nharmful to the interests of the United States. This raises a security concern under the foreign\npreference guideline.\nBased on all the evidence, Foreign Preference Disqualifying Condition (FP DC) 10(a)\n(exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen or\nthrough the foreign citizenship of a family member. This includes but is not limited to: (1) possession\nof a current foreign passport) and FP DC 10(b) (action to acquire or obtain recognition of a foreign\ncitizenship by an American citizen) apply in this case. \nI have considered all the Foreign Preference Mitigating Conditions (FP MC), and I especially\nconsidered FP MC 11(a) (dual citizenship is based solely on parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in a foreign\ncountry), FP MC 11(b) (the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship),\nand FP MC 11(e) (the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security authority,\nor otherwise invalidated). Applicant was always considered a dual citizen even though he was born\nin the United States, because his parents were Israeli citizens. If Applicant had done nothing to\nactively exercise his dual citizenship, FP MC 11(a) would be totally applicable. I do not give him\nas much credit under FP MC 11(a), since he actively exercised his dual citizenship by obtaining and\nusing an Israeli passport while a U.S. citizen. Applicant has verbalized a willingness to renounce\ndual citizenship, so FP MC 11(b) is applicable. He has done nothing to actually follow up on his\nexpressed willingness to renounce his Israeli citizenship. \nApplicant gave his Israeli passport to his FSO, which potentially invokes FP MC 11(e). Prior\nto the implementation of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines, it was a requirement that Applicant\u2019s\nclearance be denied or revoked unless Applicant surrendered the foreign passport to the issuing\nauthority.  This provision was not included in the revised Adjudicative Guidelines, possibly because\n20\nsurrender of a passport to the issuing country could signal the country that this is an individual who\nhas or is seeking a security clearance. Since the revised guidelines are new, this disqualifying\ncondition has not yet been interpreted by the Appeal Board. The mitigating condition requires that\nthe passport be \u201cdestroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security authority, or otherwise invalidated.\u201d\nThe passport was not destroyed, so that language does not come into play. The key phrases are\n\u201csurrendered,\u201d \u201ccognizant security authority,\u201d and \u201cor otherwise invalidated.\u201d I accept that\n\u201ccognizant security authority\u201d includes the FSO, so Applicant has satisfied that part of the mitigating\ncondition. The issue is whether Applicant\u2019s actions constituted a \u201csurrender,\u201d within the meaning\nof the mitigating condition. Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary, Tenth Edition, defines\nsurrender as:\n\n8\n1a: to yield to the power, control or possession of another upon compulsion or\ndemand  <~ed the fort>   b: to give up completely or agree to forgo esp. in favor of\nanother   2a: to give (oneself) up into the power of another, esp. as a prisoner   b: to\ngive (oneself) over to something (as an influence) ~ vi: to give oneself up into the\npower of another : YIELD   syn see RELINQUISH\nI find the definition under 1b, to be the most appropriate, \u201cto give up completely or agree to forgo\nesp. in favor of another.\u201d The last phrase in the mitigating condition, \u201cor otherwise invalidated,\u201d\nsheds light on the interpretation of surrender. It is clear that the mitigating condition requires the\npassport to be invalidated. In this case the FSO has possession of the passport, but will return it to\nApplicant whenever Applicant desires. The FSO is doing little more than acting as a safety deposit\nbox for Applicant. The Israeli passport has not been invalidated. I do not find this constitutes a\ncomplete surrender of the passport. FP MC 11(e) is not totally applicable. \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence\nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual has divided\nloyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person,\ngroup, organization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure\nor coercion by any foreign interest. This raises a security concern under the foreign influence\nguideline. Adjudication under this guideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign\ncountry in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not limited to,\nsuch considerations as whether the foreign country is known to target United States citizens to obtain\nprotected information and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism.\nI considered Foreign Influence Disqualifying Condition (FI DC) 7(a) (contact with a foreign\nfamily member, business or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or\nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation,\ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion), and FI DC 7(b) (connections to a foreign person,\ngroup, government, or country that create a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s\nobligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign\nperson, group, or country by providing that information). \nApplicant\u2019s father and brother no longer live or work in China. No disqualifying condition\nis raised by their former presence in China. \nApplicant\u2019s father is a citizen of Israel, but a permanent resident of the United States. His\nmother is a dual citizen of Israel and the United States. Israel is an active collector of economic and\nindustrial information, including proprietary and classified information. I find FI DC 7(a) and FI DC\n7(b) have been established. \nI considered all the Foreign Influence Mitigating Conditions (FI MC), and especially FI MC\n8(a) (the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are\nlocated, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is unlikely that\nthe individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign\nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S.), and FI MC 8(b) (there\nis no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign\n\n9\nperson, group, organization, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep\nand longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to\nresolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest).\nApplicant\u2019s father is an Israeli citizen, and his mother is a dual citizen, but both live in the\nU.S. His parents would like to retire in Israel at some point. They have no set plans, and may never\ndo so. Any movement to Israel at this point is speculative. Applicant was born in this country, and\nhis immediate family are all native-born U.S. citizens. I find that it is unlikely that Applicant will\nbe placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of his parents or Israel, and the\ninterests of the United States. FI MC 8(a) is applicable. I am unable to find FI MC 8(b) because of\nApplicant\u2019s actions to obtain recognition of his Israeli citizenship, and his exercise of a right of\nIsraeli citizenship, by obtaining and using an Israeli passport.\nWhole Person Analysis\nThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is an acceptable security risk. Available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in\nreaching a determination. In evaluating Applicant\u2019s case, I have considered the adjudicative process\nfactors listed in the Directive and AG \u00b6 2(a). I have also considered all the evidence, and every\nfinding of fact and conclusion discussed above. \nApplicant was born in the U.S. to Israeli citizens. His two brothers were also born in the U.S.\nApplicant is married to a native-born U.S. citizen, and they have two children. His mother became\na U.S. citizen, but maintains dual citizenship with Israel. His father is still an Israeli citizen. Both\nApplicant\u2019s parents live in the U.S. While they would like to eventually move to Israel, they have\nno immediate plans to move. Applicant\u2019s character evidence described him as a well respected,\nhonorable man, and a loyal citizen, with dedication, integrity, and commitment to work and family.\nApplicant obtained an Israeli passport in 2004, because it made it slightly easier to pass\nthrough Israel\u2019s immigration lines. When he did so, he obtained official recognition of his Israeli\ncitizenship. His renewed Israeli passport will not expire until 2014. Applicant gave his Israeli\npassport to his company\u2019s FSO, who certified that if Applicant requests the return of his Israeli\npassport, the FSO will document the facts and circumstances surrounding the return by an entry in\nthe JPAS. This somewhat mitigates security concerns because the U.S. will know when Applicant\nis utilizing the passport. It does not totally mitigate security concerns because the passport remains\nvalid, and Applicant can access it at any time. Applicant has verbalized a willingness to renounce\nhis Israeli citizenship, but has done nothing to actually follow up on that verbalization. While actual\nrenunciation of dual citizenship is not required to satisfy the pertinent mitigating condition, it is easy\nfor one to say he or she is willing to renounce dual citizenship, when one may never actually intend\nto do anything about the dual citizenship. In this case, Applicant\u2019s intentions and motivation for\nretaining his Israeli passport and citizenship are unclear. \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions and evaluating all the evidence\nin the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the foreign influence security\nconcerns, but has not mitigated the security concerns based on his foreign preference.\n\n10\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.

She has failed to mitigate the trustworthiness concerns raised under financial\nconsiderations. Applicant's eligibility for a trustworthiness position is denied.\n\nThis action is taken under Executive Order 10865, dated February 20, 1960, as amended.\n1\nThe government submitted eight items in support of its contentions.\n2\nItem 2 (Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR, dated October 21 2006) at 1-4.\n3\nItem 4 (Application for Public Trust Positions (SF 85P), dated August 19, 2004) at 1-10.\n4\nItem 2, supra note 3, at 1-4.\n5\nId.\n6\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn August 19, 2004, Applicant submitted an application for a position of public trust, an\nADP I/II/III position. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant the\napplication under Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (the \u201cDirective\u201d).  On September 28, 2006,\n1\nDOHA issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision. The SOR,\nwhich is in essence the administrative complaint, alleged security concerns under Guideline F,\nFinancial Considerations of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on December 29, 2005,\nand implemented by the Department of Defense effective September 1, 2006. The revised guidelines\nwere provided to Applicant when the SOR was issued.\nOn October 21, 2006, Applicant submitted a notarized response to the SOR, and elected to\nhave her case decided on the record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the\ngovernment\u2019s written case on January 31, 2007. Applicant received a complete file of relevant\nmaterial (FORM) on February 7, 2007, and was provided the opportunity to file objections and\nsubmit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the government\u2019s case.  Applicant submitted\n2\nadditional information on February 25, 2007. The case was assigned to me on March 13, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted all allegations in her SOR response under Guideline F.  The admissions\n3\nare incorporated as findings of fact. After a complete review of the evidence in the record and upon\ndue consideration, I make the following additional findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 33-year-old woman employed as an office claims associate in a position of\npublic trust for a defense contractor. After graduating from college in 1992, she worked in the\nmedical insurance claims field. She has worked for her current employer since 1998. She is a single\nparent with one child.  \n4\nApplicant\u2019s nine debts in the SOR total approximately $9,182. The debts in the SOR are not\nin dispute.  She admitted that they were delinquent debts, but were acquired during the time she was\n5\na single parent. She acknowledged that many of her financial decisions were impulsive, and that her\ncredit has always been \u201cquestionable.\u201d  One of the debts was a voluntary car repossession. Applicant\n6\n\nItem 5 (Credit Bureau Report, dated October 12, 2004) at 1-4.\n7\nApplicant\u2019s Letter, dated February 25, 2007, at 1-2.\n8\nId.\n9\n Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 527 (1988).  \n10\n4\noffered no explanation for the other debts. Multiple accounts were charged off or placed for\ncollection between 2001 and 2005, including credit card debt and cable. Several of the debts have\nbeen in collection since 2001.  \n7\nApplicant insists her job and her personal life are separate. She does not understand why this\nfinancial concern has arisen at the current time. She stated that her employer knew of her bad credit\nand hired her. She has been in the current position for nine years, and feels she should not be\nquestioned about her loyalty, trustworthiness, or any \u201cespionage\u201d at this point in her career.\nHowever, she does not feel she should discuss her financial issues with anyone who does not know\nher or who can help resolve the issue. At the same time, Applicant wondered why her employer\nnever counseled her about her credit issues.8\nApplicant has not made any payments on the delinquent accounts. She acknowledged that\nshe is unable to pay her debts because the monthly debt and expenses exceed her monthly income\nby $332. In her February 25, 2007 letter, Applicant proclaimed she is currently enrolled in a church\nfinancial planning program (eight weeks in length). She admitted she does not have a budget in place\nyet, but is now addressing her debts and how to develop a plan to pay off the majority of the debt.\nApplicant provided no evidence of any mitigating conditions involving medical problems or other\nextenuating circumstances.  \n9\nApplicant provided no information concerning her work record. She loves her job and\nbelieves she should be allowed to retain her position. She expects to start part time employment in\nApril 2007 to help pay some of the debt. \n.\nPOLICIES\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national\nsecurity and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position \u2026 that\nwill give that person access to such information.\u201d   In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\n10\nClassified Information Within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), the President set out guidelines and\nprocedures for safeguarding classified information and determining trustworthiness within the\nexecutive branch. \nTo be eligible for a security clearance or access to sensitive information, an applicant must\nmeet the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  The revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth\npotentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline.\nAdditionally, each security decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the\nrelevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the adjudicative\n\n Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.1.\n11\n Id.\n12\n Id.\n13\n Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n14\n Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n15\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. December 19, 2002).\n16\n Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.2.\n17\n5\nprocess factors listed in \u00b6 6.3 of the Directive, and AG \u00b6 2(a). The adjudicative guideline at issue in\nthis case is: \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations - Failure or inability to live within\none\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor\nself-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and\nregulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified or sensitive information. An\nindividual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in\nillegal acts to generate funds.\nConditions that could raise a trustworthiness concern and may be disqualifying, as well as\nthose which could mitigate concerns pertaining to these adjudicative guidelines, are set forth and\ndiscussed in the conclusions below.\n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.\u201d    An administrative\n11\njudge must apply the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d and consider and carefully weigh the available, reliable\ninformation about the person.   An administrative judge should consider the following factors: (1)\n12\nthe nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to\ninclude knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the\npresence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for\nthe conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of\ncontinuation or recurrence.   \n13\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR that\ndisqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.14\nThereafter, the applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate the facts.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent\n15\nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d  Any doubt as to whether\n16\naccess to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor\nof the national security.  The same rules apply to trustworthiness determinations for access to\n17\nsensitive positions.\n\nAG \u00b6 18.\n18\n6\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. The government\nhas established a prima facie case for disqualification under Guideline F of the revised Adjudicative\nGuidelines (AG) most pertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case.\n \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) The Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s\nmeans, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment,\nor unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual who\nis financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.18\nIn this matter, the government provided substantial evidence that Applicant accrued nine\ndelinquent debts with an approximate total balance of $9,182. She admits they are still outstanding\ndebts. She admits her financial situation is strained. Her 2004-2007 credit reports confirm the debt.\nConsequently, Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions (FC DC) AG \u00b619(a), (inability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts) and FC DC \u00b619 (c), (a history of not meeting financial obligations)\napply. \nWith the government\u2019s case established, the burden shifts to Applicant to present evidence of\nrefutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against her. I considered the Financial\nConsiderations Mitigating Condition (FC MC) AG \u00b620 (a), (the behavior happened so long ago, was\nso infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment). It does not apply because\nshe still carries a significant amount of delinquent debt. One collection account is from 2001. Despite\nsteady employment, she has not made any payments on her debts. Moreover, she does not believe the\ngovernment should involve itself in her financial matters.\nApplicant mentioned her single parenthood, but provides no evidence or explanation\nconcerning its effect on her credit card use. In fact, to the contrary, she asserts that her financial affairs\nshould not be discussed with anyone . Applicant provided no evidence to support the FC MC AG \u00b620\n(b), (the conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss\nof employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or\nseparation) and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstance).\nFC MC AG \u00b620 (c) (The person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/\nor there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or under control) only partially\napplies. Applicant indicates that she is currently enrolling in a church financial planning workshop,\nand will develop a budget. This recent endeavor does not mitigate her years of ignoring the debt. Also,\nshe indicated she will begin part time employment in April 2007. A promise to take action in the future\nis not sufficient to mitigate the financial considerations concern. All of the debts remain outstanding.\nShe has not taken steps to resolve these debts. Applicant's financial problems remain.  It is unlikely\nthey will be resolved in the near future.\n\n7\nFC MC \u00b620(d) (The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts) is not applicable. Applicant has not shown that she established a record of\nsteady payments or financial stability. She made no attempts to resolve the majority of the delinquent\naccounts. She admitted that her net remainder of negative $332 after paying monthly expenses\nprohibits payments on her delinquent debts. I cannot conclude that she made a good-faith effort to\nresolve her debts despite her intentions to do so in the future. \nThe issue before me is not whether Applicant is still legally liable for any or all of her\noutstanding debts, but whether she has presented sufficient evidence of extenuation, mitigating or\nchanged circumstances to warrant a favorable trustworthiness determination. Her remaining unpaid\ndebt constitutes a trustworthiness concern. In the last few years, she has not made a concentrated effort\nto repay this debt. She has been employed with her current employer since 1998. Her decision to\nquestion the government\u2019s interest in her financial affairs presents a doubt about her willingness to\naccept responsibility for her conduct and her trustworthiness to hold a position. I find that Applicant\u2019s\nunwillingness to take responsibility and resolve her outstanding debt outweighs any positive factors\nin this case. She has not mitigated the government\u2019s concerns under Guideline F.\nWhole Person\nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The\nobjective of the trustworthy determination process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a\nperson\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for assignment to sensitive\nduties. Indeed, the adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in considering\nthe \u201cwhole person\u201d concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of their acts,\nomissions, motivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful\nanalysis.\nI have considered all the evidence and the \u201cwhole person\u201d in evaluating Applicant\u2019s\ntrustworthiness. Even an applicant with a good or even exemplary work history may engage in conduct\nthat has negative trustworthiness implications. It is premature to grant Applicant a trustworthiness\nposition based on her lack of action toward resolving her delinquent accounts. Applicant\u2019s actions to\nignore her creditors, with only a recent attempt to start a financial planning workshop present doubt\nabout her judgment. Despite her steady employment since graduating from college in 1992, Applicant\nhas accrued multiple delinquent accounts. It is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nApplicant eligibility for assignment to sensitive duties. Eligibility is denied.\n.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1. Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n8\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s request for a determination of trustworthiness and\neligibility for assignment to sensitive duties.

He has\na history of unpaid debt since at least 1996.  After finally getting serious about debt resolution, he\nhas paid about 50% of his past due debts.  He also deliberately falsified two answers on his security\nclearance application.  His evasive and unresponsive answers to questions during the hearing\nimpacted negatively on his credibility.  He successfully mitigated security concerns about financial\nconsiderations, but failed to mitigate security concerns about personal conduct.  Clearance is denied..\n\nGovernment Exhibit 1 (Security Clearance Application, dated May 6, 2004).\n1\nTr. at 35-40.\n2\n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn May 6, 2004, Applicant submitted a Security Clearance Application (SF 86).   The Defense Office of Hearings and\n1\nAppeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  As required by\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on January\n30, 2007, detailing the basis for its decision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the Directive.  The President issued revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) on December 30, 2005.  DoD implemented them on September 1,\n2006.  Pending official amendment/reissue of DoD Directive 5220.6, the AG are to be used in all\ncases when the SOR is dated on or after September 1, 2006.  Because the SOR was issued after\nSeptember 1, 2006, DoD policy requires that this case proceed under the revised guidelines. \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on February 21, 2007, and elected to have a hearing\nbefore an administrative judge.  The case was assigned to me on March 7, 2007, and a Notice of\nHearing was dated on March 20, 2007.  I convened a hearing on March 30, 2007, to consider\nwhether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s  security\nclearance.  The government offered seven exhibits, marked as Exhibits 1-7, and four rebuttal exhibits\nmarked as rebuttal exhibits 1-4.  Applicant objected to Exhibit 5 which was overruled.  Applicant\noffered eighteen exhibits, marked as Exhibits A-R.  All other exhibits were admitted without\nobjection.  I kept the record open until April 27, 2007, to allow Applicant the time to file additional\ndocuments.  He filed eleven documents that were marked as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits S through CC.\nAlthough Exhibits BB and CC were received after the date the record closed, the government had\nno objection, and the exhibits were admitted.  On May 14, 2007, Applicant filed Exhibits DD and\nEE.  The government objected as they were sent after the date the record closed.  The objections are\noverruled and the exhibits admitted.  DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on April 24, 2007.\n  \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted the allegations contained in SOR subparagraphs 1.c., 1.e.,  1.i., 1.j., 1.m.,\n2.a., and 2.b.  He denied all other allegations in the SOR.  The admissions are incorporated herein\nas findings of fact.  After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon\ndue consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact: \nApplicant is a 36-year-old  switchboard operator employed by a defense contractor.  He is\nsingle and has no children.  He is a high school graduate and has one  years\u2019 credit towards a college\ndegree.  He has no prior military service, and he has held a security clearance since 1996.2\nFinancial Considerations\n\n Government Rebuttal Exhibit 2 (Summary of Disqualifying Information, dated December 29, 1995) at 1, 3-4.\n3\nGovernment Exhibit 5 (Credit Report, dated April 6, 2007) at 1-3.\n4\nId. at 77-78.\n5\nId. at 78.\n6\n3\nApplicant has had financial problems since at least 1996.  When seeking his initial a security\nclearance, he was given a summary of disqualifying information (SDI) listing the government\u2019s\nconcerns about his finances.  \n3\nAs of December 5, 2005, Applicant had the following debts:\nSOR \u00b6\nDebt\nAmount\nBalance\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit No.\n1.a.\nCell phone\n$223\n$33\nK\n1.b.\nJudgment\n$1,362\n-0-\nGov\u2019t Ex 3, pp.14-17\n1.c.\nTax lien\n$3,276\n$68\nEE\n1.d.\nCollection account\n$1,114\n$964\nY, Z\n1.e.\nCharged off\n$1,458\n$1,130\n1.f.\nCharged off\n$2,992\n$2,992\n1.g.\nCollection account\n$574\n$557\nE, W, CC\n1.h.\nCollection account\n$1,707\n$1,707\n1.i.\nCharged off\n$757\n$607\nI\n1.j.\nCollection account\n$2,128\n-0-\nC, O, T\n1.k.\nCharged off\n$663\n$663\n1.l.\nCharged off\n$315\n-0-\nX, BB\n1.m.\nGarnishment\nSame as 1.b.\nThe total amount of delinquent debt listed in the SOR was $16,569.  Based upon the evidence\nproduced by Applicant, he still owes approximately $8,721.  The most recent credit report shows a\ntotal past due of  $7,675.   Some, but not all, of the payments he has made toward debt retirement\n4\nwere made after October 2006.\nApplicant was put on notice about the debt listed in SOR subparagraph 1.a.  He was sent\ninterrogatories in December of 2006, that listed the debt.  A statement of reasons was issued in\nJanuary 2007.  He waited until March 2007 and made a $31 payment on March 28, 2007.   When\n5\nasked why he waited so long to contact them, he said he didn\u2019t have enough time, and gave an\nunresponsive answer.6\n\nId. at 39, 58.\n7\nGovernment Exhibit 1 (Security Clearance Application (SF 86), dated May 6, 2004) at 6..\n8\nId. at 112.\n9\nId. at 113.\n10\n4\nApplicant became unemployed for about 18 months between 2002 and March 2004, when\nhis employer\u2019s government contract expired, and the company laid off employees.7\nPersonal Conduct\nApplicant falsified material facts on a security clearance application (SF 86), dated May 6,\n2004.  In response to the following, Question 38.  Your financial delinquencies - 180 days  In the\nlast 7 years, have you been over 180 days delinquent on any debt(s)?, he answered \u201cNo.\u201d  He did not\nspecify the debts listed in the SOR subparagraph s 1.a., 1.d. through 1.f., and 1.h. through 1.l., listed\nin the above table.\nIn response to the following, Question 39.  Your financial delinquencies - 90 days  Are\nyou currently over 90 days delinquent on any debt(s)?, he answered \u201cNo,\u201d knowing that he had the\ndebts listed in the SOR subparagraphs 1.a., 1.d. through 1.f., and 1.h. through 1.l., listed in the above\ntable.8\nAn example of Applicant\u2019s evasive response at the hearing is shown by the following\nexchange with Department Counsel: \nQ.\nIf you look at questions 38 and 39, \u2018in the last seven years, have you been over 180\ndays delinquent on any debt.\u2019  That\u2019s been answered no.  And \u2018are you currently over\n90 days on any debt?\u2019  You answered no.  Where on this document would the\ngovernment be put on notice that you have been unemployed and had some financial\nproblems?9\nA.\nWell, that didn\u2019t happen until--well, it\u2019s like when this EPSQ was basically done\nhere, you notice a calendar date of May 6, 2004.  Okay, when I left--when I came\nback to the unemployment, it\u2019s like that wasn\u2019t mentioned.  It\u2019s like when I sat down\nwith the supervisor and they did this stuff again, I didn\u2019t mention that because I was\nworking.10\nApplicant was asked about a 2001 income tax return that he filed, but did not include\npayment with the return.  He said he did.  He was then asked if he knew that when he filled out his\nsecurity clearance application in 2004.  His response:\nWell, it\u2019s like when I filled out a security clearance application, because there was\nso many discrepancies and so many problems with the EPSQ, I had problems saying\na lot of stuff to send out to the headquarters for my company.  So I had to go back,\n\nId. at 87-88.\n11\nId. at 108-109.\n12\n5\nfill in additional information, save this by account, have my supervisor sit down\nbecause it didn\u2019t work right.11\nIn another exchange:\nQ.\nSo when you filled out your security clearance application, your EPSQ, in 2004, you were\naware that the government had concerns in the past regarding your financial history, and that\nyou had to be completely accurate and up-front about your financial history on your EPSQ.\nA.\nOkay.\nQ.\nWould you agree with that?\nA.\nWell, it\u2019s like--like I said, it was discrepancies within the EPSQ.  But yes, I acknowledged\nit, and I was taking care of the staff.  It wasn\u2019t like--I guess you were trying to pose your\nquestion like I just sat there and I did nothing.  That\u2019s not a true statement.\nQ.\nNo, that\u2019s not what I\u2019m asking.  What I\u2019m asking you is you were put on notice based on\nwhat happened in 1994 to 1996, that the government had concerns about you, your financial\nhistory, in the past.\nA.\nYes.\nQ.\nWould you agree with that?\nA.\nWell, they had a question about a few.  It wasn\u2019t like a financial--because it wasn\u2019t a\nfinancial history then.  What you had made before, that\u2019s--\nQ.\nWait.\nA.\n--not an accurate statement.12\nPOLICIES\nIn an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s security suitability, an administrative judge must consider\nthe \u201cAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified Information\u201d\n(Guidelines).  In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines are\ndivided into disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used to determine an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law.  Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, an administrative judge should apply these guidelines in\nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. Guidelines \u00b6 2.  An administrative\n\nGuidelines \u00b6 2(c).\n13\nGuidelines \u00b6 2(b).\n14\n\u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might  accept as adequate to support a\n15\nconclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006)\n(citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1).  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing\ntwo inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial\nevidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966).  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a\nscintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4  Cir. 1994).\nth\nSee ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  The Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence\n16\n \nas a whole, both favorable and unfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent\nprovisions of the Directive, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.15.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006). \n6\njudge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision.  Because the\nentire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person\nconcept,\u201d an administrative judge should consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.13\nSpecifically, an administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors\nlisted at Guidelines \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency\nand recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5)\nextent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nSince the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision\nin each case is arrived at by applying the standard that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being\nconsidered for access to classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d   In\n14\nreaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based\non the evidence contained in the record.  Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on\nmere speculation or conjecture.\nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d   The\n15\nGovernment initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a case which demonstrates,\nin accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nor continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information.  Once the government has produced\nsubstantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, the burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence\nand prove a mitigating condition.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 provides, \u201cThe applicant is responsible for\npresenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by\napplicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] has the ultimate burden of persuasion\nas to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  The burden of disproving a mitigating condition\nnever shifts to the government.16\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with\nthe government predicated upon trust and confidence.  It is a relationship that transcends normal duty\n\nExecutive Order 10865, \u00a7 7. \n17\n7\nhours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well.  It is because of this special relationship the\ngovernment must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to\nwhom it grants access to classified information.  Decisions under this Directive and the guidelines\ninclude, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain\ndegree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nThe scope of an administrative judge\u2019s decision is limited.  Nothing in this decision should\nbe construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied\ndetermination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.  \n17\nCONCLUSIONS\nGuideline F\u2014Financial Considerations\nGuidelines \u00b6 18. The Concern. Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to\nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nGuidelines \u00b6 19. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying\ninclude:\n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and\n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\nApplicant has a history of delinquent debts since at least 1996.  The government established\nits case under Guideline F.  He has a lengthy history of inattention to delinquent debt. \nGuidelines \u00b620. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:\n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s\ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death,\ndivorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear\nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control; and\n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve\ndebts.\n\n8\nBecause his answers to questions were evasive and unresponsive, it was difficult to determine\nthe current status of his debts.  However, after examining all exhibits, it appears that he has reduced\nhis debts by about 50%.  The table I used indicates about $8,700 due, and the most recent credit\nreport indicates about $7,700 of delinquent debt.  The problem is being resolved and he has made\na good-faith effort to repay creditors, even though he only became serious about repaying his\ncreditors  in recent months.  Mitigating conditions \u00b6 20 (b), (c),  and (d) apply.  He also should have\nconsideration for the time he was unemployed between 2002 and 2004.  Losing a job is an unforseen\nevent and qualifies mitigating condition \u00b6 20 (b).  Based upon these conditions, I conclude Guideline\nF for Applicant.\nGuideline E\u2014Personal Conduct\nGuidelines \u00b6 15. The Concern. Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an\nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Of special\ninterest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process\nor any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nGuidelines \u00b616. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying\ninclude:\n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel\nsecurity questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations,\ndetermine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.\nApplicant falsified two questions on his security clearance application.  The government\nestablished its case under Guideline E.\nGuidelines \u00b6 17. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:\n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or\nfalsification before being confronted with the facts;\n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused or significantly\ncontributed to by improper or inadequate advice of authorized personnel or legal counsel advising\nor instructing the individual specifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made\naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the individual cooperated fully and\ntruthfully;\n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or\nit happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on\nthe individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;\n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to change the\nbehavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused\nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur;\n\nDirective \u00b6 E.2.2.1.\n18\nId.\n19\nId.\n20\n9\n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation,\nmanipulation, or duress;\n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable reliability;\n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or occurs under\ncircumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or\nwillingness to comply with rules and regulations.\nIn reviewing the mitigating conditions, I do not find any that apply.  Applicant\u2019s continual\nevasive and unresponsive answers to questions during the hearing weigh heavily against his\ncredibility.  He had filled out a security clearance application before.  He knew he had delinquent\ndebts over 180 days.  I find he deliberately gave false answers on his EPSQ.  I conclude Guideline\nE against Applicant.\nWhole Person Analysis\n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.\u201d   \u201cAvailable,\n18\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be\nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u201d   In evaluating Applicant\u2019s case, in addition to the\n19\ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions, I also considered the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept in evaluating\nApplicant\u2019s risk and vulnerability in protecting our national interests.   I considered his age (36),\n20\nhis education, his employment, his unemployment, and what might motivate him to be less than\ntruthful.  Applicant supplied false answers on a security clearance application.  This is problematic\nbecause candor with the government about a person\u2019s negatives is the crux of a security clearance\ndetermination.  If a person fails to disclose the adverse information about himself, then he may  not\nbe trusted with confidential or classified information.  Even though he is getting his finances under\ncontrol,  his overall track record with finances shows a marked indifference to his creditors.  This,\ncombined with his lack of truthfulness,  raises questions about his reliability and judgment.  The\ntotality of the record raises reasonable and persistent doubts about Applicant\u2019s ability to protect\nclassified information and to exercise the requisite good judgment and discretion expected of one\nin whom the government entrusts its interests.  I conclude it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\n\n10\nParagraph 1.

His debts are due to major\nmedical expenses for himself and his late wife incurred while they lacked sufficient health care\ncoverage. He has always tried to live well within his means, and is able to meet his current\nobligations, which include his ongoing medical expenses not covered by his health insurance. This\nyear, his income will increase and his expenses will decrease for the first time since 2003. His past\nfinancial problems are outweighed by his current finances, and by the integrity, good judgment,\ntrustworthiness and reliability he has displayed in his current job over the past four years. His\nomission from a security questionnaire of information about past due debts was unintentional.\nClearance is granted.\n\n Required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and by DoD Directive 5220.6 (Directive), as amended.\n1\n Ax. A consists of three letters of recommendation for Applicant. Department Counsel contended the first letter\n2\nis inadmissible because the author also testified at the hearing, rendering the letter cumulative. Department Counsel\nobjected to the second letter on grounds it presents factual testimony by a witness not available for cross-examination.\nI have considered and herewith overrule both objections in light of the provisions of Directive E3.1.19, which relaxes\nthe rules of evidence in favor of developing as complete a record of relevant information as possible. More specifically,\nI am not influenced for or against the parties by the fact one witness has put in writing part of what he testified to at\nhearing (Tr., 70 - 79), or by the representations in another letter of facts that were not disputed at hearing.\n \u201cYour Financial Delinquencies - 180 Days. In the last 7 years, have you been over 180 days delinquent on\n3\nany debt(s)?\u201d\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn June 1, 2005, Applicant submitted a Security Clearance Application (SF 86). After\nreviewing the results of the ensuing background investigation, adjudicators for the Defense Office\nof Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) were unable to make a preliminary affirmative finding  that it is\n1\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. On May 25, 2007,\nDOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts that raise trustworthiness\nconcerns addressed in the Directive under Guideline F (financial considerations) and Guideline E\n(personal conduct).\nApplicant timely responded to the SOR, and requested a hearing. The case was assigned to\nme on July 11, 2007, and I convened a hearing on August 8, 2007, at which the parties appeared as\nscheduled. The government offered six exhibits, all of which were admitted without objection (Gx.\n1 - 6). Applicant testified, presented one witness and introduced, through a post-hearing submission,\none exhibit, which I have admitted over objection by Department Counsel as Applicant\u2019s Exhibit\n(Ax) A.  DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on August 23, 2007.\n2\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe government alleged that Applicant owes $29,082 in delinquent debt for 25 unpaid\naccounts. Of the debts listed, 17 are unpaid medical accounts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.q) totaling $10,557,\nwhich have been referred to collection agencies or are at least 180 days past due. Of the remaining\ndebts, the largest is for the $17,434 remainder after resale of a car repossession (SOR \u00b6 1.y). The\nremaining $1,091 consists of unpaid utilities (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.r and 1.x) and other personal credit accounts\nreferred for collection (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.s - 1.w). The government also alleged that Applicant deliberately\ntried to deceive or mislead the government about his financial problems when he answered \u201cno\u201d to\nquestion 38  of his SF 86 (SOR \u00b6 2.a).\n3\nApplicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.y, but denied the SOR \u00b6 2.a allegation.\nHaving personally assessed his demeanor while testifying, and his responses to questions from\nopposing counsel and the bench at the hearing, I found him to be credible and sincere. His\nadmissions are incorporated herein as facts. After a thorough review of the transcript and exhibits,\nI make the following additional findings of fact.\n\n Gx. 1; Gx,. 3.\n4\n Gx., 3; Tr., 31 - 33.\n5\n Gx. 1; Tr., 31.\n6\n Gx. 3; Tr., 56.\n7\n Tr., 40 - 41; 52 - 54.\n8\n4\nApplicant is 59 years old and works for a defense contractor as an administrative assistant\nto the security manager at his job site. He was hired by his employer in July 2003, after working as\nan administrative assistant for a one-man insurance consulting firm from May 2002 until July 2003.\nApplicant received his BA in English in 1973 and spent most of the next 30 years working and\ndirecting music ministries for various Baptist churches in either Florida or South Carolina.  For\n4\nmuch of his employment before 2003, Applicant had little or no health insurance. His employment\nin 2002 and 2003 did not pay much but offered minimal health care coverage.5\nApplicant and his wife were married in July 1968. They had one child, a daughter, who is\nmarried and lives in South Carolina.  Applicant\u2019s wife died in February 2005. A life-long diabetic,\n6\nshe required medical attention for several years, but her health took a turn for the worse around 2001,\nwhile Applicant was working in Florida but without health insurance. She became seriously ill and\nApplicant decided they should move from Florida to South Carolina to be close to their daughter,\nwho could help care for her mother. The bills for his wife\u2019s health care not covered by social security\nor disability benefits went unpaid.\nApplicant\u2019s wife went on kidney dialysis in 2004. Also that year, she had to move to a\nnursing home so she could receive the full-time care Applicant and his daughter were unable to\nprovide. In January 2005, doctors amputated one of her legs. When she died the next month,\nApplicant was only able to pay for her funeral with help from family and friends. He is still\nresponsible for many of her unpaid medical expenses.\nApplicant has also faced medical problems of his own. He has been hospitalized four times\nsince 2005 for ailments relating to his heart, blood pressure, kidneys, and the removal of his gall\nbladder, which caused him to miss most of the first four months of work in 2006. He takes\nmedication every day for his kidneys and blood pressure. Since being hired by his current employer\nin 2003, Applicant has had 80/20 health coverage, which means he pays the first 20% of his medical\ncosts. He also makes a $20 co-payment each time a doctor sees him.7\nThe unpaid medical debts listed in the SOR are for both Applicant and his wife, but it is\nunclear which debt is for which person. After receiving two DOHA interrogatories about his\nfinances, he contacted a local medical center where he and his wife received most of their medical\nservices since 2003. He was told the unpaid accounts were being referred to collection agencies, and\nhe is in the process of trying to settle or consolidate the accounts through a repayment plan he can\nafford.  \n8\nIn 2001, when his wife\u2019s health began to fail, Applicant had to choose between paying certain\nmonthly obligations and paying for his and his wife\u2019s medical care. His car was repossessed, leaving\n\n Tr., 24 - 25.\n9\n Tr. 58.\n10\n \u201cYour Financial Record - Repossessions. In the last 7 years, have you had any property repossessed for any\n11\nreason?\u201d\n Tr., 23 - 24.\n12\n Gx. 1; Tr., 22 - 24, 28 - 30, 46 - 52.\n13\n5\nhim with a debt of about $17,400 (SOR \u00b6 1.y). Applicant has not been able to pay this debt, but the\ncreditor has not obtained a judgment against him or referred the debt for collection.  Other debts,\n9\nincluding a gas bill (SOR \u00b6 1.r), two utilities bills (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.t and 1.u),and two cell phone accounts\n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.v and 1.w) went unpaid and were referred for collection. Applicant admitted a delinquent\nphone bill (SOR \u00b6 1.x) is attributable to him, but disputes its validity because he still has service with\nthe same carrier and has not been told of any arrearage.  The debt listed at SOR \u00b6 1.s is also a\n10\ncollection account, but there is no information available identifying the original creditor or how the\ndebt arose. Nonetheless, Applicant admitted he owes the debt. The debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.r - 1.x total\n$1,091.\nApplicant\u2019s job requires him to process paperwork associated with access to the military\nfacility he supports. Initially, his position did not require a security clearance, but now he must have\na secret clearance because he must have access to the Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS)\nto print out the forms and other information needed to manage access to the facility. When Applicant\nwas hired in 2003, he was asked to complete an electronic version security clearance application (SF\n86) on a floppy disk. He did so, but it was not actually executed until June 1, 2005, when a copy was\nprinted and given to Applicant to review and sign. \nIn response to questions about his finances, Applicant answered \u201cyes\u201d to question 35,  and\n11\nlisted the car that was repossessed in 2001. That debt, in his mind at the time, was the \u201cthe real\nkicker\u201d he owed.  He did not disclose that he was delinquent on any other debts. Two years after\n12\ncompleting the form electronically, Applicant did not review the document carefully, as shown by\nthe fact his wife was still listed in response to question 8. Applicant admitted he missed the omission\nwhen he signed and submitted the form in 2005, but denied any intent to falsify his answers or to\nmislead the government about his finances.  I found his testimony about this issue credible.\n13\nAs of the hearing, Applicant was earning about $35,000 gross annually, which is roughly the\nsame as when he was hired in 2003. He has been selected for a higher paying job working for a\nformer supervisor on a new project. He will earn about $39,000 gross annually in that job. Applicant\nhad also obtained a second job working for a local church. The job will pay him another $13,000 and\nwill provide him a place to live rent free. His rent as of the hearing was $535. Aside from utilities,\nfood, and other routine monthly expenses, Applicant has no other large financial obligations. He\ndrives a used car his daughter gave him, and he spends any extra money he has each month on his\nmedications and doctors visits. Were it not for the medical costs not covered by his insurance,\n\n Gx. 1; Tr., 36 - 39, 42 - 44.\n14\n Tr., 70 - 73. \n15\n Ax. A.\n16\n Adjudication of this case is controlled by the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, approved by the President\n17\non December 29, 2005,which were implemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006. Pending official\nrevision of the Directive, the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines supercede the guidelines listed in Enclosure 2 of the\nDirective. They apply to all adjudications or trustworthiness determinations in which an SOR was issued on or after\nSeptember 1, 2006.\n Directive, 6.3.\n18\n Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2 lists the following factors: \u201c(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of\n19\nthe conduct; (2) The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) The frequency\nand recency of the conduct; (4) The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) The extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) The\nmotivation for the conduct; (8) The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; (9) The likelihood of\ncontinuation or recurrence.\u201d\n Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2.\n20\n6\nApplicant estimated he would have about $300 remaining each month (more after he begins his new\njobs) to devote to paying his old debts.14\nThe former supervisor for whom Applicant will again be working testified in support of\nApplicant. He praised Applicant\u2019s work performance and reliability. He also verified that Applicant\nsought overtime work starting in 2004.  A government employee at the activity supported by\n15\nApplicant\u2019s company also praised his integrity, attention to detail, and reliability despite being faced\nwith the personal problems described above. The company program manager for the contract to\nwhich Applicant is assigned remarked on his good decision-making ability, and his achievements\nin teaching and training new members of the staff.16\nPOLICIES AND BURDEN OF PROOF\nThe Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines  to be considered in evaluating an\n17\napplicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information. Each security clearance decision must\nreflect consideration of both disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions under each\nadjudicative issue applicable to the facts and circumstances of each case, as well as a fair and\nimpartial common sense consideration of all available relevant and material information.  The\n18\npresence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative of a conclusion\nfor or against an applicant. However, specific applicable guidelines should be followed whenever\na case can be measured against them as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial\nof access to sensitive information. Further, the decision must include \u201cthe careful weighing of a\nnumber of variables  known as the whole person concept. Available, reliable information about the\n19\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a\ndetermination.\u201d20\n\n Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, at 528, 531(1988).\n21\n See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).\n22\n Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 18.\n23\n Gx. 2, a second set of interrogatories posing the same questions as the first, was signed and returned by\n24\nApplicant on March 20, 2007. Applicant did not attach any documentation or answer any of the specific questions posed\ntherein. It is apparent that Applicant had nothing further to add to his first response to those questions. As neither party\naddressed this exhibit in any meaningful way, I did not find it helpful to either party.\n \u201c(a) a history of not meeting financial obligations; (c) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.\u201d\n25\n \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person's control (e.g. loss of\n26\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual\nacted responsibly under the circumstances;\u201d\n7\nSecurity clearance decisions are intended solely to resolve whether it is clearly consistent\nwith the interests of national security for an applicant to receive or continue to have access to\nclassified information. The government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information\non which it based the preliminary decision against the applicant. Additionally, the government must\nbe able to prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, the\nburden then shifts to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case. Because\nno one has a \u201cright\u201d to such access,  an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion. One who has\n21\naccess to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government based on\ntrust and confidence. The government, therefore, has a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant\npossesses the requisite judgement, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national\ninterest as if it were his or her own. Resolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s\nsuitability for a security clearance should be resolved in favor of the government.22\nCONCLUSIONS\nFinancial Considerations. Under Guideline F, \u201c[f]ailure or inability to live within one\u2019s\nmeans, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment,\nor unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. An individual\nwho is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\u201d  The\n23\ngovernment presented sufficient information, consisting of two credit reports (Gx. 4, Gx. 5),\nApplicant\u2019s response to DOHA interrogatories (Gx. 3)  and Applicant\u2019s admissions to the\n24\nallegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.y, to support the SOR allegations that Applicant owed at least $29,000\nin delinquent debts accrued between 2001 and 2006. Available information also showed he has not\npaid or otherwise resolved any of those debts. The foregoing requires consideration of Guideline F\ndisqualifying conditions 19(a) and 19(c).  \n25\nOf the mitigating conditions (MC) listed under Guideline F, these facts fall squarely within\nMC 20(b).  The medical problems of Applicant\u2019s late wife, his low income while working in\n26\nreligious ministries, and his lack of any or adequate medical insurance when his wife\u2019s condition\nbecame serious in 2001 all directly contributed to his inability to pay his debts. Department Counsel,\n\n Tr., 87 - 90.\n27\n Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 15.\n28\n Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 16(a): \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts\n29\n    from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations,\ndetermine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness,\nor award fiduciary responsibilities; \u201c\n8\nwhile acknowledging the past medical problems were beyond his control and were the cause of his\npast delinquencies, argues MC 20(b) should not apply because Applicant did not satisfy the second\nprong by \u201cact[ing] responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d  I disagree. That argument does not take\n27\ninto account the ongoing burden Applicant\u2019s present medical problems place on his ability to pay\nor otherwise resolve his debts. Nor does the argument account for the fact Applicant sought overtime\nwork in 2004, has received a pay raise, and has obtained a second job that will add to his income and\nreduce his expenses. While it would have been ideal for Applicant to have been able to make these\nchanges sooner, opportunities do not always arise when most convenient.\nThe mere presence or absence of delinquent debts does not end the inquiry into whether one\u2019s\nfinancial problems present an unacceptable security risk. The issue is whether Applicant\u2019s unpaid\ndebts put him at risk of engaging in illegal acts to generate funds to pay his debts, or whether his\nfinancial problems reflect adversely on his judgment, reliability, self-control, or willingness to follow\nrules and regulations. There is no denying the Applicant carries significant debts that he will have\ntrouble paying, if he ever can. However, he did not incur the debt through mismanagement of his\nfinances, through frivolous spending, or through deceptive financial practices. Nor has he tried to\nevade his obligations. He has no credit cards, he drives a used car that has been paid for, and is trying\nto increase his income and reduce his expenses so he can begin to pay off his debts while still being\nable to pay for his medications. All of the foregoing presents a sufficient information from which\nto conclude he will not violate the government\u2019s trust for financial reasons. The Guideline F security\nconcerns are resolved in favor of the Applicant. \nPersonal Conduct. Under Guideline E, \u201c[c]onduct involving questionable judgment, lack\nof candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Of\nspecial interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance\nprocess or any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\u201d  The government\n28\nalleged Applicant deliberately falsified his answer to SF 86 question 38 when he answered \u201cno\u201d\n(SOR \u00b6 2.a), thereby trying to conceal the true extent of his debts. \nThe SF 86 clearly shows he so answered; however, to be disqualifying, his answer must have\nbeen given with intent to mislead and deceive.  A simple mistake or, as happened here, carelessness\n29\nin overlooking an answer initially rendered two years earlier, do not constitute intent to mislead. On\nthis issue, Applicant was credible in his explanation of the way the SF 86 was submitted. Further,\nhe had nothing to gain by disclosing the largest of his debts, a car repossession, and seeking to hide\nthe other medical debts. The allegation that he knowingly made a false statement to the government\nin June 2005 is not supported by the record. I conclude Guideline E for the Applicant.\nWhole Person. I have evaluated the facts presented by all of the available information, and\nI have applied the appropriate adjudicative factors, pro and con, under Guidelines E and F. I have\n\n See note 19, supra.\n30\n See note 18, supra. \n31\n9\nalso reviewed the record in the context of the whole person factors listed in section 2(a) of the\nRevised Adjudicative Guidelines.  Applicant is a mature adult who has worked for most of his adult\n30\nlife in religious ministries. He took a more secular career path at age 53 out of necessity when his\nwife\u2019s health reached a crisis. Applicant did not voluntarily participate in or invite the facts and\ncircumstances about which the government is concerned. Nonetheless, rehabilitation and permanent\nbehavioral changes are evident in the financial adjustments he has made and the modest way he lives\nhis life. Further, his employer and associates speak of him in glowing terms, most likely because of\nthe exemplary way he has conducted himself in the face of his financial and personal hardships. A\nfair and commonsense assessment  of all available information, particularly the facts bearing on the\n31\nunderlying causes of his financial problems and his response thereto, shows that the Applicant\u2019s\nfinances do not present an unacceptable risk should he be granted access to classified information.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings regarding each SOR allegation are as follows:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial):\nFOR THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a - 1.y:\nFor the Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E (Personal Conduct)\nFOR THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor the Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the information presented, it is clearly consistent with the interests of\nnational security to grant Applicant a security clearance.\nMatthew E.

Item 1 is the source for the facts in \nthe remainder of this paragraph unless stated otherwise. \n \nJune 3, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \nr revoked. \n                                                          \n1992, as amended, modified and revised.2 The SOR alleges security concerns under \nGuideline E (Personal Conduct). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make \nthe preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for him, and recommended \nreferral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, \ncontinued, denied, o\n \nOn March 27, 2008, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and elected to \nhave his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing (Item 2). A complete \ncopy of the file of relevant material (FORM), dated April 21, 2008, was provided to him, \nand he was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, \nextenuation, or mitigation.3 Applicant responded to the FORM on May 27, 2008. The \ncase was assigned to me on May 30, 2008. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted the sole SOR allegation. He knowingly carried a cell phone \nthat included a camera feature into a sensitive federal facility, despite knowing it was in \nviolation of physical security policies. His admissions are incorporated herein as findings \nof fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the \nfollowing findings of fact.   \n \n \nApplicant is 27 years old.4 He graduated from high school in 1995. He attended a \nuniversity from August 1999 to May 2004, and received a bachelor of science degree in \ncriminal justice. He began working in security services for a federal contractor in \nJanuary 2005, and in 2008 he was a shift supervisor (Item 5). He has never married. He \nhas not served on active duty in the U.S. military. According to Sections 11 and 22 of \nhis SF 86, his employment as a childcare supervisor in August 2004 ended under \nadverse circumstances. He explained, \u201cI was regrettably asked to resign due to a poor \ndecision during a particular situation.\u201d The file does not contain additional information \nabout this employment resignation. In Section 24, he admitted that he used marijuana \nsix times and cocaine twice while in college. On May 10, 2006, he told an Office of \nPersonnel Management (OPM) investigator that he used cocaine five times to ten times \nin college, but he could not remember more than two occasions (Item 5 at 2-3). He also \n \n2On Aug. 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a memorandum \ndirecting application of revised Adjudicative Guideline to all adjudications and other determinations made \nunder the Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program \n(Regulation), dated Jan. 1987, as amended, in which the SOR was issued on or after Sep. 1, 2006. The \nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines are applicable to Applicant\u2019s case. \n \n3Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) transmittal letter, is dated Apr. 23, 2008; and \nApplicant\u2019s receipt is signed and dated Apr. 30, 2008. The DOHA transmittal letter informed Applicant that \nhe had 30 days after Applicant\u2019s receipt to submit information. \n \n4Item 4 (2005 security clearance application) is the source for the facts in this paragraph, unless \nstated otherwise. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                                          \nadmitted frequent, binge alcohol consumption in college, and driving while intoxicated \non about 10 occasions in college (Item 5 at 3-4). He told an OPM investigator in 2006 \nthat he drinks alcohol to intoxication about once a month, but does not drive while \nintoxicated (Item 5 at 4-6). The last time he was intoxicated by alcohol was August 4, \n2007 (Item 5 at Interrogatory 9b). By 2008, he had reduced his alcohol consumption to \ntwice a month, six beers per occasion. Id. He denied that he had ever been arrested, \nand did not provide any other information that reflected adversely on his judgment. \nBecause he did not receive notice in the SOR concerning his illegal drug use, falsifying \nhis SF 86 by understating his cocaine use, his 2004 employment resignation, and \nexcessive alcohol consumption, such adverse information will not be used as part of this \nsecurity clearance determination.     \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \nThe SOR lists one allegation. Applicant knowingly carried a cell phone that \nincluded a camera feature into a sensitive federal facility, despite knowing it was in \nviolation of physical security policies.  An organizational instruction for physical security \napproved in May 2007 states, \u201cCell phones that include a camera feature are \nprohibited in all [organizational] facilities\u201d (emphasis in original). (Item 6 at \u00b6 7k(1)(a)). \nAppendix 3 reiterates: \n \n2. Items not permitted in [organizational] facilities unless expressly \npermitted in writing for official reasons. These items may be approved in \nwriting with restrictions.  \n \na. Photography and imagery equipment and media such as cameras or \ncell phones with camera capability. \n \nEmphasis in original. \n   \nAn OPM investigator interviewed Applicant on May 10, 2006, August 23, 2007, \nand September 18, 2007.5  On May 10, 2006, he succinctly described the possession of \na camera-cell phone: \n \nWhen questioned as to the best telephone number to reach him, the \nsubject gave his cell phone number. The subject volunteered that he has \nhis cell phone on him at all times during the day, to include when he is \nworking as a security guard at the [sensitive federal government site]. The \nsubject also volunteered that his cell phone has a camera in it. He \nvolunteers that he keeps the phone on his belt unless he is going into a \n[restricted building], when he puts the phone in his pocket. The subject \nvolunteered that having a camera phone inside [the restricted building] is \nnot allowed, but assumes that as long as no one sees the phone, no \n \n5 On January 9, 2008, Applicant swore that the information in his three OPM interviews was \naccurate. Item 5 is the source for the facts in this paragraph unless stated otherwise. \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                                          \nconsequences will be incurred. Subject plans to continue carrying his cell \nphone in his pocket whenever he is inside the [restricted building] unless \notherwise directed.   \n \nItem 5 at 3.6 At his OPM interview on August 23, 2007, he elaborated that as part of his \nduties he provides security briefings, which include telling employees that they are not \npermitted to have their personal cell phones turned on while in [restricted buildings].    \n  \nAt his OPM interview on September 19, 2007, Applicant admitted he brings his \ncamera-cell phone inside restricted buildings even though he knows such conduct is \nprohibited by official policy. He asserted there was an unofficial policy that permitted \nsuch conduct. He does not always turn-off his cell phone when inside restricted \nbuildings because sometimes he forgets and enters a building without turning it off. The \ntelephone feature on personal cell phones does not work because of the metals in the \nrestricted building\u2019s walls. The policy on camera-cell phones is strictly enforced with \nvisitors, but employees can retain a camera-cell phone as long as it is out of sight. He \ncarries his camera-cell phone because the official policy is not enforced. Applicant does \nnot have access to classified materials. He plans to continue to carry his camera-cell \nphone in restricted buildings. If his supervisors told him not to continue his practice of \ncarrying his camera-cell phone into restricted buildings, he would comply with that \ndirective.       \n    \nIn his response to the FORM, Applicant stated: \n \nI have not carried my camera phone into the building since I was made \naware that it was not allowed, even if the phone is turned off. The few \ntimes that it was carried into the building, it was turned off including during \nany time that I had to unexpectedly go into the building and did not have a \nchance to put the phone in my car beforehand. When the phone was \nbrought into the building, it was without a doubt an oversight on my part \nand it has not happened nor will it ever happen again.7 \n \nApplicant is respected by his fellow security officers.8 His integrity and honesty \nhave not been questioned or doubted. He is a responsible and trusted member of the \nsecurity staff. He is a dedicated, highly-motivated professional. He has a positive, \ncheerful, helpful attitude. He takes pride in his work, and has shown firm and fair \nqualities when disciplining subordinates.  \n \n6 The agency policy concerning camera-cell phones in effect when Applicant made his 2006 \nadmission is not part of the record. His subsequent admissions about on-going possession of his camera-\ncell phone occurred after the May 2007 policy that was included in the record became effective. \n    \n7 I specifically find that he knowingly and deliberately brought his camera-cell phone into sensitive \nbuildings, and his statement that his violation was unintentional is disingenuous.    \n \n8 Applicant\u2019s FORM response includes three letters of support. One is from a peer and two are \nfrom security supervisors. These three letters are the sources for the facts in this paragraph. \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                                          \n  \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nIn the decision-making process, the Government has the initial burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d9 \ndemonstrating, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information. \nOnce the Government has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, \nthe burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \nGovernment. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).10 \n \n9 See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind \nmight accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d ISCR \nCase No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cThis is something less \nthan the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the \nevidence does not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Consolo v. \nFederal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966). \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but \nless than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. \n1994). \n \n10 \u201cThe Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and \nunfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the \n\n \n6 \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                          \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly \nabove, I conclude the relevant security concern is under Guideline E (Personal \nConduct). AG \u00b6 15 articulates the security concern relating to personal conduct: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 provides two Personal Conduct Disqualifying Conditions that could raise \na security concern and may be disqualifying in this case. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c), 16(d)(1) and \n16(d)(3) provide: \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not \nproperly safeguard protected information; and \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \n \nDirective, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006). \n\n \n7 \n \n \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nperson may not properly safeguard protected information. This includes \nbut is not limited to consideration of: . . . (1) untrustworthy or unreliable \nbehavior .  .  .; [and] (3) a pattern of .  .  . rule violations. \n \nApplicant\u2019s history of knowingly and deliberately violating a physical security rule \nconcerning carrying a camera-cell phone into restricted buildings is documented in his \nOPM interview and his SOR response. His response to the FORM, in which he denied \nthe violations were deliberate, is not credible. Because this is a rule violation, as \nopposed to violating several adjudicative guidelines, it does not qualify as \u201ccredible \nadverse information in several adjudicative issue areas . . .\u201d (emphasis added) and AG \n\u00b6 16(c) does not apply. However, his rule violations are clearly untrustworthy and \nunreliable behavior, as well as \u201ca pattern of . . . rule violations,\u201d meeting the \ndisqualifying condition in AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(d)(1) and 16(d)(3).   \n \n  \nSeven Personal Conduct Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(a)-(g) are \npotentially applicable: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or \noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules \nand regulations. \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 17(a) and 17(b) do not apply because the SOR does not allege that \nApplicant falsified a security document or failed to cooperate with a security \ninvestigation. AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(f) and 17(g) do not apply because his rule violations were \nsubstantiated, and his rule violations were not caused or related to association with \ncriminals.  Moreover, his rule violations do cast doubt on his \u201creliability, trustworthiness, \njudgment, or willingness to comply with rules.\u201d \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c)-17(e) do not fully apply. His rule violations are serious, and \ncontinued up to about a year ago. He carried his camera-cell phone into restricted areas \non many occasions from 2005 to 2007. His conduct shows a deliberate disregard for \ncompliance with rules designed to protect security. These violations are particularly \negregious in light of his responsibility as a shift supervisor on the security force to \nenforce security rules. His rule violations are likely to recur and do cast doubt on his \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6 17(d) partially applies because he \nhas acknowledged his rule violations. Although he did not obtain counseling to change \nthe behavior, his promise not to carry his camera-phone into restricted areas is a \npositive step toward alleviation of \u201cthe stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused \nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(e) partially applies \nbecause he has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, \nmanipulation, or duress by admitting the rule violations.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be \nan overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines \nand the whole person concept. AG  \u00b6 2(c).   \n\n \n9 \n \n \n                                                          \nApplicant\u2019s record of good employment, aside from the rule violations at issue, \nweighs in his favor. Two supervisors and one peer lauded his hard work and \nprofessionalism as an employee. His youth and inexperience as an employee supports \napproval of his clearance. There is no evidence of any other security issues. Aside from \nhis rule violations (which are not a criminal issue), he is a law-abiding citizen.11 He \ncompleted his college education, and earned his bachelor of science degree. These \nfactors show some responsibility, rehabilitation, and mitigation. \n \nThe evidence against mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct is more substantial. \nApplicant was well aware of his security responsibilities. He knowingly chose not to \ncomply with those security responsibilities. His decision to start abiding by security rules \nwas too recent, when compared to the multiple, deliberate rule violations. Moreover, his \nclaim in his FORM response that the violations were inadvertent is not a candid and full \nacceptance of responsibility.          \n \n  \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, all the facts and \ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, and on the law, as set forth in \nDepartment of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988), Applicant has not mitigated or \novercome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I conclude personal conduct \nsecurity concerns are not mitigated, and he is not eligible for access to classified \ninformation. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:    \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security \nclearance for Applicant. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nMark W.

Clearance is denied. \nSTATEMENT OF CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for Applicant. As required by Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 \u00b6 E3.1.2\n(Jan. 2, 1992), as amended, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on January 4, 2007,\ndetailing the basis for its decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (financial\nconsiderations) of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on December 29, 2005 and\nimplemented by the Department of Defense effective September 1, 2006.\nIn a sworn statement dated January 26, 2007, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations\nadmitting all of them. Applicant elected to have her case decided on the written record. Department\nCounsel submitted the government\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) on July 11, 2007. The FORM\nwas mailed to Applicant on July 16, 2007, and received on July 20, 2007. Applicant was afforded\nan opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation.\nApplicant responded on July 23, 2007 with additional material. Department Counsel had no\nobjections and the documents were included in the record. The case was assigned to me on August\n15, 2007. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant is a 36-year-old material coordinator who has worked for a federal contractor since\nSeptember 2004. Prior to then she was unemployed since February 2004. She is single and has no\nchildren. Applicant filed for bankruptcy in 2001 as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. Her only explanation was\nthat she got in over her head and had been living with someone who left and was paying half of all\nof the bills.  In April 2002 she had $50,000 in debt discharged in bankruptcy. No accounting or\n1\nexplanation was provided as to what type of debts she had accumulated that were discharged nor\nwhat actions she had taken prior to the discharge. \nThe debt listed in SOR \u00b6 1.b is for an automobile that was repossessed for nonpayment in\nabout January 2004. The amount owed is $1,743.63. No information was provided as to the status\nof this debt. \n\nItem 4 at 4.\n2\nId. at 7.\n3\nResponse dated July 23, 2007. \n4\nItem 6 at 5. \n5\n3\nThe debt listed in SOR \u00b6 1.c is for the amount of $356 went into collection in January 2004.\nNo information was provided as to the status of this debt.\nThe debt listed in SOR 1.d is presumably for telephone services in the approximate amount\nof $2,977. The account was placed in collection in March 2004 and no information was provided as\nto the status of this debt. \nThe debt listed in SOR 1.e is to a credit union in the approximate amount of $7,233 for the\nbalance owed on a automobile that was repossessed for nonpayment in March 2004. She negotiated\na repayment plan with the collection firm. The balance on the debt has increased to $8,203.20. She\nagreed to pay $170.90 per month for 48 months.  She provided proof that she made monthly\n2\npayments in October, 2006, November 2006 and December 2006.  No further documentation was\n3\nprovided that she has continued to make monthly payments.\nThe debts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.g are in the amounts of $98 and $134 respectively and\nwere forwarded for collection in March 2005 and December 2005. Both were paid on January 31,\n2007, from Applicant\u2019s tax refund.4\nApplicant\u2019s personal financial statement (PFS) dated October 2006 shows a net monthly\nsalary of $1,948 and expenses as $1,737, with a remainder monthly balance of $211.  Her statement\n5\nincludes the $170.90 monthly payment for the balance owed on her repossessed car and a loan from\na credit union for $15,000, for which she pays $302 monthly. Her PFS does not show payments to\nany other creditors. Applicant has not provided any additional documentation to show she is repaying\nher debts or has contacted creditors to resolve them. \nApplicant stated in her answer:\nIn Dec. 2006 I moved into [a] cheaper home for the main reason of getting my\nfinances squared away. I am planning to pay my debts one at a time once I am settled\nin my home. I am working on the biggest debt now. At the same time I plan to pay\nthe smaller ones first and work my way up. After losing my job, I lost everything and\nhad to move in with my dad. I am back on my feet now and will get this taken care\nof.\nIn her response dated July 23, 2007, she did not provide additional information as to what\nfurther actions she has taken on her delinquent debts since moving into her new home.\nPOLICIES\n\nDepartment of the Navy v.

I\nreach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the SOR.\nBased upon consideration of the evidence, I find the following adjudicative guideline most\npertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case:\nFinancial Considerations are a security concern because failure or inability to live within\none\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual\nwho is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nCompulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes including espionage. Affluence\nthat cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a security concern. It may indicate\nproceeds from financially profitable criminal acts. \nBased on all of the evidence, Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC)\n19(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and FC DC 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial\nobligations), apply in this case. Applicant has debts that are delinquent. She had $50,000 in debts\ndischarged in bankruptcy in 2002. Bankruptcy is a legitimate means of resolving delinquent debts\nand obtaining a fresh financial start. However, Applicant slid back into financial difficulty and many\nof her debts are again in a collection status and have been since as far back as January 2004. \nI have considered all of the Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC), and\nespecially considered FC MC 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment), FC MC 20(b) (the conditions\nthat resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances), FC MC 20(c) (the\nperson has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications\nthat the problem is being resolved or is under control), and FC MC 20(d) (the individual initiated\na good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts). Applicant\u2019s debts are\nrecent and some remain unpaid. She has paid two debts and has a repayment plan for a third, but\nfailed to specifically address and provide information on the other debts. Applicant had $50,000 in\ndebt discharged in bankruptcy in 2002 giving her a new financial start. She was unemployed for a\n\n6\nperiod of approximately nine months in 2004. This event obviously set her back financially.\nHowever, her debt in SOR \u00b61.b was sent to collection in January 2004, prior to her unemployment\nand after her bankruptcy, which means she was delinquent on her debt while she was employed. The\ndebts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.g were relatively small debts that have since been paid, but those\ndebts were sent to collection in March 2005 and December 2005, again while Applicant was\nemployed. She did not pay either of those debts until her security clearance became an issue. No\nexplanation was provided regarding why these debts were not paid timely. Based on Applicant\u2019s\nhistory, I find that the circumstances that her behavior is likely to recur and her actions do cast doubt\non her reliability and good judgment. I find FC MC 20(a) does not apply. \nI have considered the circumstances regarding Applicant\u2019s unemployment and the results it\nhad on her financial situation. These circumstances were beyond her control. However, she provided\nlittle explanation as to why after having her debts discharged in bankruptcy she was again in a\nfinancial crisis prior to her unemployment. Applicant filled out her security clearance application\nin June 2005 and was aware that her financial status was a concern. Some of the circumstances she\npresented were beyond her control, but it has been three years since her unemployment and there is\nlittle evidence that she addressed her finances until her security clearance became an issue. I find FC\nMC 20(b) does not apply.\nApplicant started a repayment plan on the debt for her repossessed automobile, but only\nprovided proof of three payments. She paid two other debts that were in collection status for more\nthan a year before being paid. She failed to take action on her other debts or provide information\nregarding them. She offered no evidence she has sought financial counseling. Her efforts to resolve\nher debts were many months after she was employed. The concern is that Applicant having already\nbeen provided a clean slate after bankruptcy is again in financial difficulty and has not sought\ncounseling. It is too early to conclude that she will not continue on the same financial road. I find\nFC MC 20(c) and (d) do not apply.\nWhole Person Analysis\nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The\nobjective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a\nperson\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.\nIndeed, the adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in considering the\n\u201cwhole person\u201d concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of his or her acts,\nomissions, motivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking\ninto consideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and\ncareful analysis.\nIn addition to considering the specific disqualifying and mitigating conditions under the\nGuidelines, I have also considered the adjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6 2a (1)-(9) of the\nGuidelines to be considered in evaluating a person\u2019s eligibility to hold a security clearance.\nSpecifically these are: (1) the nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nand surrounding the conduct to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency\nof the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation was voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. Although the presence\n\n7\nor absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative,\nthe Guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance.\nI considered all of the evidence provided and the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept in evaluating\nApplicant\u2019s risk and vulnerability in protecting our national interests. After weighing the\ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F and evaluating  the evidence in the context\nof the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns based on financial\nconsiderations. Therefore, I am persuaded by the totality of the evidence in this case, that it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. Accordingly,\nGuideline F is decided against Applicant.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1\nFinancial Considerations (Guideline F)\nAGAINST  APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g.\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

(See Government Exhibits 9 and 10).\n\n3\nDuring his most recent arrest for DUI in October 2006,  the Applicant was rear-ended by a\ntruck and based upon the police report of the incident it is a miracle that he survived the accident.\nThis horrifying experience was an eye opener for the Applicant and caused him to re-evaluate his\nlife.  Following the accident and arrest, he joined a church, dedicated his life to God, and became\na Christian.  He is now a single parent of a ten year old son who depends on him for support and\nproper upbringing.  He no longer consumes alcohol, smokes or uses any illegal drugs.  He is also\ncurrently involved in a recovery program that is sponsored by his church.  He will remain on\nprobation for this arrest until 2009.  He now realizes the seriousness of his past conduct.  He has no\ndesire to ever consume alcohol again.  Although he tried to stop using alcohol in the past and was\nonly able to abstain for as much as two months at a time, this time is different and he feels confident\nthat he will be successful.  The Applicant has been completely sober since his DUI in October 2006.\nThe Applicant attributes his excessive alcohol consumption to a period when he was under\na lot of pressure and was responsible for taking care of his very sick mother who was in and out of\nthe hospital.  At that time he had no support system and self medicated to deal with the stress.  His\nlife has drastically changed since then.  He no longer consumes alcohol, he does not smoke or use\nany illegal drugs.  He testified that he plans to remain sober, stay faithful to his God, and that he has\nfriends in the church to provide the support he needs to accomplish this.  (Tr. p. 143).  \nParagraph 2(Guideline F- Financial Considerations).  The Government alleges that the Applicant is\nineligible for clearance because he is financially overextended.\nThe Applicant admits each of the debts set forth in the SOR under this guideline.  \nThe Applicant is indebted to seventeen separate creditors totaling an amount of at least\n$18,787.00.  (See Government Exhibits 2, 4, 5, 6 and 7).  The Applicant has not been able to satisfy\nhis debts because of the expense of his most recent DUI.  A four month period on disability and\nperiods of time where 25% of his wages were garnished by a creditor also caused him difficulties\nin paying his bills on time.  Each of the debts listed in the SOR remain outstanding, except one.  A\ndebt owed to Fireside, set for th in allegation 2(b), of the SOR, was settled sometime last year by the\nApplicant in the amount of $900.00 to $1,000.00.  \nThe Applicant\u2019s wages are currently being garnished in the amount of $350.00 a pay period\nby a creditor who is not listed in the SOR.  The Applicant\u2019s current financial situation is bleak.  He\nis barely making ends meet and is living paycheck to paycheck.  His present financial obligations\ninclude court costs, the cost of the DUI program, support for his son, rent, food and gas.  \nTo resolve his current indebtedness he plans to file for Bankruptcy.  The cost of filing is\napproximately $500.00 that he does not have.  He plans to get the money from his church.  He plans\nto list all of his delinquent creditors, including all of the debts listed in the SOR, in the bankruptcy\npetition.  (Tr. p. 73).\nApplicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit contains a letter from an attorney he retained to file his\nChapter 7 Bankruptcy petition.   \nParagraph 3 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct).  The Government alleges that the Applicant is\n\n4\nineligible for clearance because he engaged in criminal conduct.\nThe Applicant admitted to each of the allegations set forth in the SOR under this guideline.\nOn October 26, 2004, the Applicant completed a security clearance application wherein he\nwas required to indicate whether he has ever been discharged, terminated, fired, or quit a job.  The\nApplicant failed to disclose that he was discharged from employment on January 18, 2002, for\nexcessive absences.  (See Government Exhibit 1, Question 20).  The Applicant testified that he was\nnot aware that he was discharged from employment for absences and so he did not answer in the\naffirmative.  The Applicant explained that the letter of termination was sent to an address that he had\nmoved from two years prior.  He never received the letter of termination and was not aware of it.\nFurthermore, there is evidence in the record indicating that the Applicant returned to work at the\nsame place of employment after the period he was supposedly terminated.  (See Applicant\u2019s Post-\nHearing Exhibit).  Under the particular facts of this case, I believe that the Applicant was not aware\nof the termination letter or the rationale concerning his employment termination.  I do not find that\nthe Applicant intentionally failed to disclose this information from the Government.  Accordingly,\nI find for the Applicant under this guideline.   \nTwo witnesses who are acquainted with the Applicant through the church that they attend,\ntestified favorably on behalf of the Applicant.  (Tr. pp. 109-119 and 121-125). \nA letter from the Director of the twelve step recovery program in which the Applicant is an\nactive participant since December 2006, indicates that the Applicant is progressing well in his\nrecovery.  (See Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A). \nA letter from the Teaching Ministry Director at the Applicant\u2019s church attests to the\nApplicant\u2019s consistency, diligence, and dedication to the 40 week course focusing on the practical\nimplications of Christianity.  (See Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B).\nA letter from the Leader of the Security Ministry at the Applicant\u2019s church indicates that the\nApplicant is a very dedicated, responsible and caring individual.  He has a passion for serving and\nhelping whenever possible.  (See Applicant\u2019s Exhibit C).\nA letter from the Applicant\u2019s Manager at work indicates that the Applicant has continued to\nperform his work in a satisfactory manner despite the occurrences in his personal life.  (See\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit D).  \nA letter from the Applicant\u2019s Pastor of Outreach from his church attests to the Applicant\u2019s\ngrowth as a Christian and his demonstrated commitment to stay sober through attending a 30 week\nrecovery program and his continued commitment to this alcohol free life style.  (See Applicant\u2019s\nPost-Hearing Exhibit).\n  \nPOLICIES\n\n5\nEnclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies divided into\n\"Disqualifying Factors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying Factors and\nMitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:\nGuideline G (Alcohol Consumption)\n21.  The Concern.  Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable\njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliabililty\nand trustworthiness.  \nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n22. (a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence,\nfighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of\nwhether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent;\n22. (c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment,\nregardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent.\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations)\n18.  The Concern.  Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial\nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and\nregulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and\nability to protect classified information.  An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of\nhaving to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n19.  (a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; \n19.  (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct)\n15.  The Concern.  Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\n\n6\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  Of special interest is any\nfailure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\nNone.\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in evaluating the\nrelevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should consider the following general\nfactors:\n a.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances\nb.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation\n \nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne.  The voluntariness of participation\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes\ng.  The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics and\nconduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question, posed in Section 2 of Executive Order\n10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request\nfor access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period\nof a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is an acceptable security risk.\nEligibility for access to classified information is predicted upon the individual meeting these\npersonnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number of\nvariables known as the whole person concept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past\nand present, favorable and unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The\nAdministrative Judge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\n\n7\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence\nwhich is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in\nExecutive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms\nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the Applicant\nconcerned.\u201d\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian\nworkers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information twenty-four hours per\nday, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore appropriately concerned when available\ninformation indicates that an Applicant for clearance may be involved in alcohol abuse, excessive\nfinancial indebtedness and personal conduct that demonstrates poor judgment or unreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding\nof a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the continued holding of a\nsecurity clearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then shifts to the Applicant to go\nforward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation, which is sufficient to overcome or\noutweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The Applicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving\nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the Applicant has\nengaged in alcohol abuse (Guideline G), financial indebtedness (Guideline F), and personal conduct\n(Guideline E).  This evidence indicates poor judgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the\npart of the Applicant.  Because of the scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude there\nis a nexus or connection with his security clearance eligibility.\nConsidering all of the evidence, the Applicant has not introduced persuasive evidence in\nrebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the Government's case under\nGuidelines G, and F of the SOR.\nUnder Alcohol Abuse, Guideline G, Disqualifying Conditions 22(a) alcohol-related incidents\naway from work, such as driving while under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse,\ndisturbing the peace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is\ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent and, 22(c) habitual or binge consumption of\nalcohol to the point of impaired judgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an\nalcohol abuser or alcohol dependent apply.  None of the mitigating conditions are applicable.\nAccordingly Guideline G is found against the Applicant. \nThe Applicant\u2019s extensive history of alcohol abuse resulted in four DUI arrests, the most\nrecent which occurred in October 2006, just thirteen months ago.  He remains on probation for the\noffense until 2009.  Although there is no formal diagnosis in the record of alcohol dependence, the\nApplicant acknowledges that he is a recovering alcoholic.  He has completely abstained from the use\nof alcohol since his last arrest.  He is commended for his recent decision and commitment to abstain\nfrom alcohol.  He is working a structured recovery program that includes Alcohol Anonymous\nmeetings in order to stay alcohol free.  He is absolutely on the right road to recovery.  However,\n\n8\npresently, more time in rehabilitation is necessary in order to show the government that he is\nsufficiently trustworthy and that he will not relapse and return to his old ways.     \nI have also carefully considered the favorable words from his church colleagues, his manager,\nand his alcohol recovery program director, but that evidence does not come close to mitigating the\nnegative effect of his numerous alcohol related arrests. \nUnder Financial Considerations, Guideline F, Disqualifying Conditions 19(a) inability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts and 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations apply.  None\nof the mitigating conditions are applicable.  Accordingly, Guideline F is found against the Applicant.\nPresently, the Applicant remains indebted  to at least seventeen separate creditors totaling\nan amount of $18,787.00.  Although he plans to file Bankruptcy under Chapter 7 he has not yet done\nit, and his debts remain outstanding.  \nWith respect to the Government\u2019s allegation concerning the Applicant\u2019s attempt to falsify\nhis security clearance, I find that he did not.  Under the particular facts of this case, I believe that the\nApplicant did not list his termination from employment on the security clearance application because\nhe was not aware of the termination letter or the rationale concerning his employment termination\nbecause he never received notice.  Accordingly, I find for the Applicant under Personal Conduct,\nGuideline E.   \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has failed to overcome the Government's case\nopposing his request for a  security clearance.   Accordingly, the evidence supports a finding against\nthe Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary allegations expressed in Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the\nSOR.  Paragraph 3 is found for the Applicant.   \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as required by\nParagraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: Against the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.b.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.c.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.d.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\nParagraph 2: Against the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  2.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  2.b.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  2.c.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  2.d.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  2.e.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  2.f.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  2.g.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n\n9\n    Subpara.  2.h.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara   2.i.: \nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  2.j.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  2.k.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  2.l.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara   2.m.: \nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  2.n.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  2.o.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  2.p.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara   2.q.: \nAgainst the Applicant.\nParagraph 3: For the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  3.a.:\nFor the Applicant.\n \n \nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.\nDarlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n \n\n10\n",

The government did\nnot establish that she intentionally falsified her answers when completing her questionnaire for a\nposition of public trust. Eligibility is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF CASE\nOn September 27, 2004, Applicant submitted an application for a position of public trust, an\nADP I/II/III position. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant the\napplication under Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (the \u201cDirective\u201d).  On December 14, 2006,\n1\nDOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision. The SOR, which\nis in essence the administrative complaint, alleged trustworthiness concerns under Guideline F\n(Financial Considerations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the revised Adjudicative\nGuidelines (AG) issued on December 29, 2005 and implemented by the Department of Defense,\neffective September 1, 2006. DOHA recommended the case be referred to an administrative judge\nto determine whether eligibility for a position of trust should be granted, continued, denied, or\nrevoked. On January 2, 2007, Applicant submitted a notarized, sworn statement in response to the\nallegations. She requested a hearing.\nDOHA assigned this case to me on February 8, 2007 and issued a notice of hearing on March\n2, 2007. At the hearing on March 22, 2007, Applicant indicated that she received the notice of the\nhearing 15 days prior to the hearing. I conducted the hearing as scheduled.  The government\n2\nsubmitted five exhibits (GE), which were marked and admitted into the record as GE 1-5 without\nobjection. Applicant submitted four exhibits (App Ex), which were marked and admitted as App Ex\nA-D without objection. Applicant testified on her own behalf. I held the record open until April 12,\n2007, to allow Applicant to submit further documents, which she did. Applicant submitted 11\nadditional documents, which were marked and admitted as App Ex E-O without objection. DOHA\nreceived the hearing transcript (Tr.) on April 10, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nIn her SOR response, Applicant admitted to the SOR allegations under Guideline F,\nsubparagraphs 1.a-1.f and 1.k-1.m.

In\n3\naddition, after a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the\nfollowing findings of fact.\nApplicant, a 27-year-old woman, who works as a claims associate for a Department of\nDefense contractor, seeks a position of public trust. She has worked for her employer more than two\nyears. Her employer recently required her to sign a confidentiality agreement, which states that if she\ndiscloses confidential information that she will be fired from her job and subjected to any and all\nremedies available under civil law.4\nIn 1999, Applicant married a young man in the military. They moved to Germany, where she\ngave premature birth to twins, a son and a daughter, in August 2000. In October 2001, she returned\nto the United States with the children. Her husband traveled with her, but returned to his duty station\nin Germany. She intended to rejoin him at his next duty station, but he called her to say he did not\nwant to be married. Thereafter, she lived with her parents for almost two years before moving to her\ncurrent location.5\nShortly after her return to the United States, Applicant learned that her daughter suffered from\na life-threatening lung disease. The doctors diagnosed her daughter with idiopathic pulmonary\nhemosiderosis (bleeding into her lungs). Because of her daughter\u2019s illness, she did not work for two\nyears. Her estranged husband did not voluntarily send her financial support after he returned to\nGermany. She eventually obtained assistance with procuring a regular monthly income allotment from\nhis military pay. She also received medical care as a military dependent. At some later time, her\nestranged husband separated from the military, but she does not know when. Her income allotment\nand medical coverage then stopped.6\nWhile in Germany, she and her husband purchased a car. Both signed the installment\nagreement. When she left Germany, her husband retained possession of the car. He took the car from\nGermany to his next duty station in Italy.  When he left Italy, he left the car there. She does not know\n7\nwhat happened to the car. She learned from the security investigator that her husband stopped making\nthe monthly payments on the car and that an arrearage on this loan existed.8\nEarly in her marriage, Applicant and her husband incurred several credit accounts for jewelry\nand clothing, including the accounts listed in allegations 1.a-1.e of the SOR. Applicant timely paid\nthese bills initially. Although she testified that she paid these bills until she left Germany, the credit\n\nGE 4 (Credit report, dated November 19, 2004); GE 5 (Credit report, dated August 29, 2006); Tr. at 27-29.\n9\nGE 4, supra note 9; GE 5, supra note 9; Tr. at 29-33, 38-39.\n10\nApp Ex D (Divorce papers); Tr. at 48-52.\n11\nApp Ex O (Earnings statements) at 1-6; Tr. at 39-41.\n12\nApp Ex A (Husband\u2019s sworn affidavit, dated February 9, 2007) at 1-3; App Ex C (Verification of course\n13\nenrollment); Tr. at 27-34, 41, 68-69.\n4\nreports of record indicate that two bills were delinquent by late 2000 and the remaining three bills\nwere delinquent by July 2001. She has not paid these bills since her return to the United States more\nthan five years ago.9\nApplicant incurred the three medical bills listed in allegations 1.f, 1.l and 1.m while a military\ndependent. She understood that the bills should have been paid by the insurance carrier covering her\nclaims as a military dependent. She does not know why the bills were not paid. She, however, has not\npaid the bills, of which two are more than three years old. Currently, her employer provides her with\nmedical insurance. Her daughter\u2019s ongoing pulmonary condition is stable and managed. The expenses\nrelated to her treatment are paid through medicaid.10\nIn 2004, a family court determined that her estranged husband should pay her child support\nin the amount of $560 a month. Over the next year, he occasionally paid this amount or some much\nsmaller amount. Since 2005, she has not received any child support from him. She filed for divorce\nin February 2007. She seeks custody of the children and child support.11\nApplicant submitted six earnings statements covering December 19, 2006 through March 11,\n2007. She earns approximately $2,088 a month in gross income, including overtime pay. Her net\nmonthly pay averages $1,537, including overtime. Her estimated monthly expenses total\napproximately $1,700.12\nApplicant denied the debts alleged in subparagraphs 1.g through 1.j, stating that these debts,\nwhich total more than $32,000, belonged to her estranged husband. He accepted sole responsibility\nfor these debts in a sworn affidavit, but did not provide any evidence of payment. Applicant has not\npaid either of the two remaining debts, one of which is four years old. She denied owing the other\ndebt, which is alleged in allegation 1.n. While she was at work, the manager at her former apartment\ncalled the police because the manager thought an intruder had broken into Applicant\u2019s apartment. The\npolice knocked the door down to enter her apartment. Now the property owner seeks payment for this\ndamage, which Applicant disputes. Applicant has been unsuccessful in her attempts to contact anyone\nto resolve this problem. She recently participated in an employer sponsored 12-week class on\nmanaging her credit issues. She has not contacted any creditor to discuss repayment of her debts, as\nshe does not have any money to pay her debts. She has no credit cards. The credit report does not\nreflect new unpaid debt in three years, except for the contested debt in allegation 1.n. and the medical\nbill she believed paid in allegation 1.m.13\nWhen Applicant completed her SF-85P on September 27, 2004, she answered \u201cno\u201d to\nquestion 22b, which asked if she \u201cwas now over 180 days delinquent on any loan or financial\n\nGE 2 (Interrogatories to Applicant and her answers, signed and sworn on October 16, 2006) at 7; Tr. at 41,\n14\n60.\nApp Ex B (Employment service recognition awards); App Ex F (Letter, dated March 23, 2007); App Ex H\n15\n(Undated letter); App Ex I (Letter, dated March 28, 2007); App Ex J (Letter, dated April 4, 2007); App Ex K (Letter,\ndated April 5, 2007); App Ex L (Performance review, dated January 2006); App Ex M (Performance review, dated\nJanuary 2007).\nApp Ex E (Letter, dated April 10, 2007); App Ex G (Letter, dated March 30, 2007); Tr. at 42.\n16\n Department of the Navy v.

Her friends and co-workers\ndescribe her as a hard worker, loving and caring mother who acts very responsibly with her children,\nreliable, dependable, and honest. Her employer rated her twice as meets expectations; nonetheless,\nher performance evaluations indicate an improvement in her performance from her first rating period\nto her second rating period.15\nApplicant applied for a house through Habit for Humanity. Habit for Humanity accepted her\napplication, as she meet all the financial and volunteer requirements established under this program\nto qualify for a home. She is on a waiting list and anticipates a new home in a year or so. She expects\nher mortgage payment to be about one-half of her current rent and her electric bill to decrease.16\nPOLICIES\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national\nsecurity and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position \u2026 that\nwill give that person access to such information.\u201d  In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\n17\nClassified Information Within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), the President set out guidelines and\nprocedures for safeguarding classified information and determining trustworthiness within the\nexecutive branch. \nTo be eligible for a security clearance or access to sensitive information, an applicant must\nmeet the security guidelines contained in the Directive. Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth\npersonnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions under\neach guideline. The adjudicative guidelines at issue in this case are: \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations - An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal or unethical acts to generate\nfunds to meet financial obligations. Similarly, an individual who is financially\nirresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligation\nto protect classified or sensitive information.

An administrative\n18\njudge must apply the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d and consider and carefully weigh the available, reliable\ninformation about the person.  An administrative judge should consider the following factors: (1) the\n19\nnature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to\ninclude knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the\npresence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for\nthe conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of\ncontinuation or recurrence.   \n20\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR that\ndisqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.21\nThereafter, the applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate the facts.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent\n22\nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d  Any doubt as to whether\n23\naccess to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor\nof the national security.  The same rules apply to trustworthiness determinations for access to\n24\nsensitive positions.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nSee ISCR Case No. 04-07360 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 26, 2006) (stating partial credit was available under FCMC\n25\n6 for debts being resolved through garnishment). \n7\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. The government\nhas established a prima facie case for disqualification under Guideline F - Financial Considerations,\nIt, however, did not establish a prima facie case under Guideline E - Personal Conduct. \nFinancial Considerations\nUnder Guideline F, the \u201cfailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by\nrules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness\nand ability to protect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk\nof having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\u201d (AG \u00b6 18.) The credit reports reflect old,\ndelinquent debts, most of which applicant acknowledged. She incurred the majority of these debts\nduring her marriage. Because of the age of these debts and their delinquent status, Applicant showed\nan inability or unwillingness to pay her debts. Based on the evidence of record, the government\nestablished the applicability of DC \u00b6 19 (a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts and DC \u00b6 19 (c)\na history of not meeting financial obligations.\nApplicant incurred most of her debt while married. Subsequent to her separation from her\nhusband in 2001, her estranged husband refused to pay the car loan, a joint debt, even though he had\nthe car. He also charged excessively on his military charge accounts, which were joint accounts. He\nacknowledged that he owes these debts, although he has not provided any evidence of payment.\nApplicant recently filed for divorce. She does not intend to remain married, thus the debt problems\ncreated by her estranged husband\u2019s spending habits is not likely to reoccur. She does not use credit\ncards and lives austerely. She is a reliable and dependable employee and a responsible parent. MC \u00b6\n20(a) the behavior . . . occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to reoccur and does not\ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment applies in part.25\nThe arrearage on some of Applicant\u2019s older, unpaid debt continued because when her daughter\nfirst became seriously ill in 2001, she did not work for two years while she cared for her daughter. Her\nestranged husband refused to voluntarily provide child support for his children. Later, her estranged\nhusband stopped making the monthly car payment, and left the car in Italy, unbeknownst to her. He\nalso continued to incur credit debt on his military credit cards, which he has not paid. Since the car\nloan and the military credit cards were joint debts created by her estranged husband\u2019s decisions, MC\n\u00b6 26 (b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control\n(e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce\nor separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances applies. \nApplicant has not met with a financial counselor, but she has taken a credit counseling course\noffered by her employer to learn how to repay old debt and improve her credit rating. She, however,\nhas not contacted her creditors to arrange payment of her debts, as she lacks any money to comply with\nany agreement. MC \u00b6 20 (c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or\nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control and MC \u00b6 20 (d) the\nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts do not\napply. While she is not required to be debt free, she must manage her income and expenditures in a\n\nThe remaining financial considerations mitigating condition set forth in AG 20 (f) does not apply in this case.\n26\nSee ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov.17, 2004)(explaining holding in ISCR Case No. 02-23133\n27\nat 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004)).\n8\nreasonable and prudent manner. At this time, she lives month to month. If she incurs any unexpected\nexpenses, she does not have money to pay for any additional expenses. Her situation will improve in\nthe next two years, once she moves into her new home, and if her estranged husband starts paying her\nchild support. The fact that her finances most likely will improve in the future is not grounds to apply\nthese mitigating conditions.\nApplicant denied owing the debts alleged in paragraphs 1.g through 1.j and 1.n of the SOR. Her\nestranged husband has acknowledged that he owes the debts related to his military credit cards and the\ncar repossession. As to the repair debt for the broken door, Applicant has not provided any\ndocumentation which reflects what challenges she made to this debt. MC \u00b6 20 (e) the individual has\na reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and\nprovides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to\nresolve the issue has some applicability.26\nPersonal Conduct\nUnder Guideline E, conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness and ability to protect sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to provide\ntruthful and candid answers during the trustworthiness process or any other failure to cooperate with\nthe trustworthiness process. (AG \u00b6 15) Under DC \u00b6 16 (a), the government established that Applicant\nomitted a material fact from her SF-85P when she answered \u201cno\u201d to question 22b. She denied,\nhowever, that she deliberately falsified her answer to this question. When a falsification allegation is\ncontroverted, the government has the burden of proving it. Proof of an omission, standing alone, does\nnot establish or prove an applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the omission occurred. An\nadministrative judge must consider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct\nor circumstantial evidence concerning an applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the omission\noccurred.  For DC \u00b6 16 (a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material\n27\nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire . . . to apply, the government must establish that\nApplicant\u2019s omission, concealment or falsification in her answer was deliberate.\nApplicant credibly testified that she misread this question, which was an error on her part.\nWhen discussing her debt issues with the investigator, she learned that her husband had not paid the\ncar loan and other debts related to his military accounts. Thus, since she was unaware of these debts,\nshe could not hide them from the government. Likewise, she did not attempt to hide her other debts.\nI find that she did not intentionally falsify her answer to question 22b. Guideline E is found in favor\nof Applicant.\nWhole Person Analysis\nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The\nobjective of the trustworthy determination process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a\n\np. 7, n. 25.\n28\n9\nperson\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for assignment to sensitive\nduties. Indeed, the adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in considering\nthe \u201cwhole person\u201d concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of her acts,\nomissions, motivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful\nanalysis.\nWhen she married, Applicant and her husband incurred credit debt, some of which they timely\npaid. Since her separation from him over five years ago, she has struggled to support herself and her\nchildren with the basic necessities of living. The record lacks any evidence that she resorted to illegal\nactivities to obtain money to pay her bills. Her daughter suffers from a life-threatening illness. When\nthis illness was first diagnosed, Applicant could not work. Now that her daughter\u2019s health is being\nmanaged, she works and earns enough money to keep her basic living expenses paid. She sought help\nwith child support through the courts, but her estranged husband has refused to comply with the court\norder. She is again seeking the court\u2019s help in obtaining child support, income which would ease her\nfinancial problems if received. \nThe creditors for the unpaid bills, including store accounts, a car repossession, and medical\nbills, in allegations 1.a through 1.l of the SOR are barred from collecting these debts under the State\nin which she resides 3-year statute of limitations. See State Code. Ann. \u00a7 15-3-530.  Thus, she\n28\nreceives partial credit for resolution of her debt. The State Court of Appeals succinctly explained the\nsocietal and judicial value of application of the statute of limitations:\nStatutes of limitations embody important public policy considerations in that they\nstimulate activity, punish negligence and promote repose by giving security and\nstability to human affairs. The cornerstone policy consideration underlying statutes of\nlimitations is the laudable goal of law to promote and achieve finality in litigation.\nSignificantly, statutes of limitations provide potential defendants with certainty that\nafter a set period of time, they will not be ha[led] into court to defend time-barred\nclaims. Moreover, limitations periods discourage plaintiffs from sitting on their rights.\nStatutes of limitations are, indeed, fundamental to our judicial system.\nCarolina Marine Handling, Inc. v. Lasch, 609 S.E.2d 548, 552 (Ct. App. 2005) (internal quotation\nmarks and citations omitted).\nElimination of these delinquent debts through the statute of limitations has ended her potential\nvulnerability to improper financial inducements because she is no longer \u201cfinancially overextended\u201d.\nApplicant\u2019s inability to pay her bills resulted from unemployment when her daughter became seriously\nill and her husband\u2019s spendthrift ways after their separation in 2001, not because she decided she did\nnot want to pay her bills. As her daughter\u2019s condition stabilized, she returned to work. She has\nassumed full parenting responsibilities for her children. She is a reliable and dependable employee\neven with her responsibilities as a single parent with a chronically ill child. She pays her current bills\nand refuses to use credit cards. She has not incurred excessive unpaid debt in the last three or four\nyears. \n\n10\nApplicant performs her duties well and is respected by her co-workers for her reliability,\ndependability and honesty. Customers compliment her work. I have weighed the mitigating factors,\nthe reasons for her debts, her current family situation, her efforts to maintain a home for her children,\nher estranged husband\u2019s acknowledgment of sole responsibility for $32,000 of old debt, and the\npositive recommendations against her inability to pay her old debts, totaling approximately $5,000.\nI find that the overwhelming weight of the evidence indicates that she is a person of integrity, who is\ntrustworthy. She would not act in a manner which would harm her employer or the government. There\nis little likelihood she would violate the privacy rights she has agreed to protect because of her existing\ndebt problems. I conclude she has mitigated the trustworthiness concerns pertaining to financial\nconsiderations. The personal conduct concern is not substantiated.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nSOR \u00b6 1-Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs a-n:\nFor Applicant\nSOR \u00b6 2-Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph a:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the evidence presented in this case, it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for assignment to sensitive duties.

This action was taken under Executive Order 10865, dated\nFebruary 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive 5220.6, dated January 2, 1992, as amended. He\nanswered the SOR on June 14, 2007, admitting the allegations and electing to have the case decided\non the written record.\nDepartment Counsel mailed the government\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) to Applicant\non July 24, 2007. He received it on July 31, 2007. Applicant was afforded an opportunity to file\nobjections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. He neither objected to any\nof the FORM submissions, nor filed any additional evidence to be considered. The case was assigned\nto me on September 7, 2007 requesting an administrative determination.\nRULINGS OF EVIDENCE\nAt the Government\u2019s request, I took administrative notice of the following facts:\n1. Morocco is a moderate, stable, democratizing nation with whom the United States enjoys\nstrong ties and good relations.1\n2. Several terrorist attacks have occurred in Morocco over the past five years. Some targeted\nU.S. interests. The potential for terrorist violence against American interests and citizens\nremains high.2\n3. Morocco has a poor human rights record. Problems include arbitrary arrest and detention.\nIt sometimes places foreign citizens under surveillance.3\nThe FORM contains seven exhibits, in addition to four source documents for the facts I\nadministratively noted. It also contained an unmarked documented entitled \u201cPersonal Subject\nInterview.\u201d It appears to be part of a report of investigation, covering the period May 22, 2006\nthrough June 5, 2006, is unsigned, and is not referenced elsewhere in the FORM.

In addition, I make the\nfollowing findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 44-year-old married man. Although he has children, the number is unknown\nfrom the record. He has a master\u2019s degree in computer science, earned from an American university\nin 1991. \nApplicant is originally from Morocco. He emigrated to the United States approximately 18\nyears ago, and became a naturalized citizen in 2004.  His mother, brother, and sisters are Moroccan\n4\ncitizens and residents.  His father is deceased. His parent-in-laws, brother-in-law, and sister-in-law\n5\nare Moroccan citizens and residents. He has traveled to Morocco eight times since June 2002 to visit\nthem.\nApplicant owns property valued at approximately $400,000 in Morocco. He inherited it from\nhis father after his death in 2002.  He maintains a savings account in a Moroccan bank with an\n6\napproximate $200,000 balance, and a checking account in a Moroccan bank with an approximate\n$1,200 balance.  He also has approximately $3,000 in a checking account in France.\n7\nApplicant is the majority owner of an information technology company. His brother-in-law\nowns a company in Morocco that contracts with several Moroccan government agencies.8\nApplicant\u2019s company has a business relationship with his brother-in-law\u2019s company. Specifically,\nthe brother-in-law\u2019s company will enter into a contract with a Moroccan government agency to\nsupply information technology hardware, and it will then purchase the hardware from various\nsuppliers including Applicant\u2019s company.  Applicant\u2019s brother-in-law\u2019s company will only purchase\n9\nthe hardware from his company if he can provide it at a competitive price. Otherwise, the company\nuses other suppliers.  Applicant\u2019s company derives less than 10 percent of its income from its\n10\nbusiness relationship with  his brother-in-law\u2019s company.  Neither Applicant nor his brother-in-law\n11\nhas any ownership interest in the other\u2019s respective companies.\nApplicant\u2019s company also has contracts with foreign companies in Germany and Canada. It\nis unclear from the record whether Applicant\u2019s company constitutes his principal employment, or\nwhether he needs a clearance in his capacity as its majority stakeholder.\n\nSee generally, Directive, Sec. 2.3, Sec. 2.5.3, Sec. 3.2, and Sec. 4.2.\n12\n4\nPOLICIES\nThe adjudicative guidelines, as revised December 29, 2005, and implemented September 1,\n2006, apply to the analysis of this case. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each\nguideline, they are divided into those that may be considered in deciding whether to deny or revoke\nan individual\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information (disqualifying conditions) and those\nthat may be considered in deciding whether to grant an individual\u2019s eligibility for access to classified\ninformation (mitigating conditions).\nBecause the entire process is a scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person\nconcept,\u201d all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and\nunfavorable, should be considered in making a meaningful decision. Specifically these are: (1) the\nnature and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the age of the\napplicant; (5) the extent to which the participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the\npotential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\nThe following adjudicative guidelines are raised:\nGuideline B - Financial Influence: Foreign contacts and interests may be a security\nconcern if the individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be\nmanipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government\nin a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any\nforeign interest.\nGuideline L - Outside Activities: Involvement in certain types of outside employment or\nactivities is of security concern if it poses a conflict of interest with an individual\u2019s\nsecurity responsibilities and could create an increased risk of unauthorized disclosure\nof classified information.\nConditions pertaining to these adjudicative guidelines that could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security concerns, are set forth and discussed\nin the conclusions below.\nSince the protection of national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision\nin each case must be reached by applying the standard that the issuance of the clearance is \u201cclearly\nconsistent with the national interest.\u201d  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions\n12\nthat are based on the evidence contained in the record.\nThe government is responsible for presenting evidence to establish facts in the SOR that have\nbeen controverted. The applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\n\nContact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a\n13\ncitizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement,\nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion.\nA substantial business, financial, or property interest in a foreign country, or in any foreign-owned or foreign-\n14\noperated business, which could subject the individual to heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation.\nThe value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial or property interests is such that [it] is unlikely\n15\nto result in a conflict and could not be used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual.\n5\nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by the government, and has the ultimate burden\nof persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\nCONCLUSIONS\nGuideline B\nSeveral of Applicant\u2019s family members are citizens and residents of Morocco, where a\nheightened risk of exploitation exists because of its questionable human rights record and recent\nhistory of terrorist activity. He has traveled there several times over the past five years to visit them,\nand has a business relationship with one of them, his brother-in-law. Applicant\u2019s contacts with these\nfamily members in conjunction with Morocco\u2019s political characteristics generate a security concern\nunder Foreign Influence Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) 7 (a).13\nUnder Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition (FC MC) 8 (a), applicants with relatives or\nacquaintances in foreign countries where a heightened risk of exploitation exists can mitigate the\nsecurity risk if they can demonstrate that the nature of their relationships, or the positions or\nactivities of those relatives or acquaintances are such that it is unlikely that any attempted\nexploitation would occur. Here, Applicant provided no such information. Absent any of this\ninformation to consider, I cannot apply FC MC 8 (a).\nApplicant\u2019s business relationship with his brother-in-law, his substantial Moroccan bank\naccounts, and his Moroccan property interests trigger the application of FC DC 7(e).  He has no\n14\nfinancial interest in his brother-in-law\u2019s company, nor does his brother-in-law have any financial\ninterest in his company. Although Applicant\u2019s company sometimes sells supplies to his brother-in-\nlaw\u2019s company that are ultimately used to fulfill the execution of several of his brother-in-law\u2019s\ncontracts with Moroccan government agencies, he does not have any direct, contractual relationship\nwith the Moroccan government. He is one of a number of suppliers with whom his brother-in-law\u2019s\ncompany contracts. Applicant\u2019s company\u2019s business relationship with his brother-in-law\u2019s company\nconstitutes less than 10 percent of Applicant\u2019s company\u2019s income. FC MC 8 (f) applies to\nApplicant\u2019s business relationship with his brother-in-law.15\nConversely, FC MC 8 (f) does not apply to Applicant\u2019s Moroccan bank accounts and the\nproperty he inherited from his father. They total in excess of $600,000 USD. He offered no\ndescription of the property, nor any information about the bank accounts for me to consider.\n\nAny . . . service, whether compensated or volunteer, with any foreign national, organization, or other entity.\n16\n6\nThe government submitted no evidence that Applicant\u2019s French checking account and his\nGerman and Canadian contracts create a heightened risk of exploitation. Consequently, I conclude\nthat they generate no foreign influence security concerns.\nGuideline L\nApplicant\u2019s business relationship with his brother-in-law\u2019s company raises the issue of\nwhether Outside Activities Disqualifying Condition (OA DC) 37(a)(2) applies.  There is no record\n16\nevidence of Applicant\u2019s job duties at his principal place of employment. Therefore, I cannot\nconclude that Applicant\u2019s business relationship with his brother-in-law poses a conflict of interest\nwith his primary employment.  Moreover, as discussed above, Applicant\u2019s business relationship with\nhis brother-in-law accounts for less than 10 percent of his company\u2019s income. There are no Guideline\nL security concerns.\nWhole Person Concept\nHaving admitted all of the allegations in the SOR regarding his relatives, Applicant had the\nburden of proving they do not create a security risk. He provided little evidence for me to evaluate\nin his Answer, and did not respond to the FORM, despite being given an opportunity to do so.\nConsequently, he failed to meet his burden, and I conclude that his foreign relatives generate an\nunacceptable security concern. Clearance is denied.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nParagraph 1 \u2013 Guideline B:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.j:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m-1.n:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2 - Guideline L:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\n\n7\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

Brenner, Esq. \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nTUIDER, Robert J., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant mitigated security concerns under Guidelines B (foreign influence) and \nF (financial considerations), but failed to mitigate security concerns under Guideline E \n(personal conduct). Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nDecision Drafting \n \nAs noted in fn 1, infra, the Applicants are husband and wife and requested a joint \nhearing having been issued nearly identical SORs. They appeared at their joint hearing \nably represented by their counsel, Mr. Brennan. Given the similarity of their respective \ncases, I have written a separate yet identical decision for the Applicants. To assist the \nreader in following a rather complicated fact pattern and to comply with the Privacy Act, \nI have taken the liberty of identifying the Applicants and key individuals with pseudo \nnames. They are: \n \n1. Male Applicant is identified as \u201cJohn.\u201d \n \n2. Female Applicant is identified as \u201cMary.\u201d  \n \n1 \n \nDecember 14, 2010\n\n2 \n \n                                                          \n3. Business associate and friend of John and Mary, who is a dual citizen of the \nUNITED STATES and Columbia and resides in Columbia, is identified as \n\u201cPablo.\u201d \n \n4. Midwestern lawyer involved in securities fraud with Pablo is identified as \n\u201cFabian.\u201d \n \n5. Major Japanese banking instrument is identified as \u201cForeign Certificate.\u201d \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn May 17, 2002 and on May 20, 2002, respectively, John and Mary submitted \ntheir security clearance applications (SF-86). On November 25, 2009, the Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued John and Mary separate Statements of \nReasons (SORs) detailing security concerns under Guidelines B (foreign influence), E \n(personal conduct), and F (financial considerations).1 The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the Department of \nDefense for SORs after September 1, 2006.  \n \n \nJohn and Mary answered their respective SORs on December 19, 2009. \nDepartment Counsel was prepared to proceed for both their cases on February 25, \n2010. These cases were previously assigned to two other administrative judges on \nMarch 4, 2010 and April 19, 2010, respectively, until they were reassigned to me on \nMay 25, 2010. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on June 2, 2010, scheduling their joint \nhearing for June 24, 2010. The hearing was held as scheduled. \n \n \nThe Government offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1(c) through 18(c) for John, \nwhich were received without objection. The Government offered GE 1(m) through 13(m) \nfor Mary, which were received without objection. John and Mary offered Applicant \nExhibits (AE) 1 through 15, which were received without objection, and they testified on \ntheir own behalf. At the conclusion of the hearing, I requested each party submit written \nclosing arguments. Department Counsel\u2019s closing argument was marked as Ex. III and \nCounsel for the Applicant\u2019s closing argument was marked as Ex. IV. DOHA received the \nhearing transcripts (Tr.) on July 2, 2010. (Tr. 18-22.) \n \nProcedural Rulings \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted two separate Requests for Administrative Notice \nfor John and Mary, (Exhibits (Exs.)) I and II, requesting that I take administrative notice \nof the summary of facts contained in Exs. I and II, as well as those facts contained in \nthe attachments to Exs. I and II. Without objection from the Applicants, I took \n \n1 On March 1, 2010, the Applicants requested to have a joint hearing, which I granted.  \n\n3 \n \nadministrative notice of the documents offered by Department Counsel, which pertained \nto Columbia. (Tr. 11-13.)  \n \nAdministrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for \nadministrative proceedings. See ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4 n.1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, \n2007); ISCR Case No. 02-24875 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. \n02-18668 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2004)); McLeod v. Immigration and Naturalization  \nService, 802 F.2d 89, 93 n.4 (3d Cir. 1986)). The most common basis for administrative \nnotice at ISCR proceedings, is to notice facts that are either well known or from \nGovernment reports. See Stein, ADMINISTRATIVE LAW, Section 25.01 (Bender & Co. \n2006) (listing fifteen types of facts for administrative notice). Various facts pertaining to \nColumbia were derived from Exs. I and II as contained infra under the subheading \n\u201cColumbia\u201d of this decision. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nJohn admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.i., 2.a., 3.a. and 3.b.; and denied 2.b. Mary \nadmitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.j., 2.a., 3.a. and 3.b.; and denied 2.b. Their admissions \nand denials were accompanied with explanations. Their admissions are accepted as \nfindings of fact. \n \n \nAs a starting off point, I find John and Mary to be credible witnesses. \nFurthermore, they are decent and honorable, hard working, productive members of \nsociety, responsible parents, and loyal U.S. citizens. Nothing that follows is meant to \ndetract from those findings. \n \nBackground Information \n \n \nJohn is the 60-year-old founder and president of a company specializing in \ncomputer and network security. He has held that position since December 1985. (GE \n1(c), Tr. 23-25.) John graduated from college with a Bachelor of Science Degree in \ncomputer science and three minors in math, chemistry, and physics in November 1973. \n(GE 1(c), SOR Response, Tr. 26.) John\u2019s company works on Government-related \nclassified projects. He seeks to retain his top secret clearance, which is required for him \nto continue participating in classified Government contracts. John has successfully held \na clearance since 1997. (GE1(c), Tr. 25-26, 29, 180, 251, 255.) \n \n \nMary is the 62-year-old corporate secretary of the company her husband, John, \nfounded. She has held that position since December 1985. (GE 1(m), Tr. 283-284.) At \npresent, her position with their company does not involve any significant duties. Rather, \nfor the past two and one-half years, she has been employed full-time by an \ninterdenominational Bible study group. (Tr. 283-284.) Mary graduated from the same \ncollege as her husband with a Bachelor of Science Degree in chemistry in November \n1971. (GE 1(m), Tr. 284.) Like her husband, she seeks to retain her top secret \nclearance, which is required for her to continue participating in classified Government \ncontracts. Mary has successfully held a clearance since \u201cthe 90s.\u201d (GE 1(m), Tr. 285, \n298.) \n\n4 \n \n \nJohn and Mary married in June 1971. (GE 1(c), GE 1(m).) They had three sons. \nTheir oldest son is 32, their second son is 27, and their third son died in a rock climbing \naccident when he was 19. Their oldest son is married and has a young child. (Tr. 176-\n177, 251-252.) \n \n \nThe rather complex and purported facts that precipitated SORs being issued \nagainst John and Mary began in approximately 1996. At that time, John and Mary\u2019s \ncompany was doing quite well. They were well established and respected members of \ntheir community and active in their local church. It was through their church that they \nmet Pablo. At the time, Pablo, his mother and sister were living in the same community \nas John and Mary. Pablo held dual citizenship with the United States and Columbia and \nhad two names \u2013 his Columbian name and his Israeli name. Pablo claimed to be an heir \nto a very wealthy banking family and that he was 109th in the lineage to be the King of \nIsrael. He further claimed that he was linked to the Rothschild family fortune and that he \nwould inherit billions of dollars upon his grandfather\u2019s death. Pablo also claimed that his \nfamily disinherited him because he converted to Christianity, but believed that he would \nstill receive his grandfather\u2019s inheritance. When Pablo\u2019s grandfather died in the 1990\u2019s, \nhe did not receive his anticipated inheritance, and Pablo later claimed he would receive \nthe inheritance when he turned 40. (GE 3(c), Tr. 181-182, 190.) \n \n \nPablo also told John that his grandfather served as an ambassador for a South \nAmerican country to several nations and died in the 1990s. Pablo\u2019s grandfather had \npurportedly left him codes to banks at different locations around the world. Pablo \nclaimed to have \u201ccracked\u201d one bank code and retrieved \u201ca bevy of documents . . . like \nthe documents that talked about the family funding the Marshall Plan.\u201d (Tr. 183-185.)  \n \n \nIn addition to befriending John and Mary, Pablo also befriended a number of \nwealthy church members. Having gained their trust and confidence, Pablo convinced \nthem to invest in the Foreign Certificate. The Foreign Certificate was purportedly \nconnected to Pablo\u2019s family wealth. John and Mary did not invest in the Foreign \nCertificate. Pablo\u2019s purpose in seeking money from investors was to cover the fees \nassociated with acquiring the Foreign Certificate. Once acquired, Pablo represented to \nthe investors that he would sell the Foreign Certificate to his family for a big pay-off. The \ncollective amount of money the church members invested with Pablo was approximately \n$1 million. All of the church members lost all of the money they invested with Pablo. (GE \n3(c), Tr. 186-187.) \n \n \nPablo was associated with Fabian, an attorney in the Midwest, and several other \nindividuals to sell the Foreign Certificate. In June 1998, the Securities and Exchange \nCommission (SEC) filed a complaint and obtained emergency injunction relief in the \noffer and attempt to sell forged and fictitious securities, i.e. the Foreign Certificate. The \nSEC alleged in its complaint that since at least March 1997, the defendants (Fabian and \nPablo, et al) had been engaging in a scheme to obtain money through the offer of \nfraudulent securities. The purported issuing bank for the Foreign Certificate, as well as \nthe FBI and the Federal Reserve, among others, confirmed that the certificate is a \nworthless, sham document. The named defendants were alleged to have been part of a \nfraudulent scheme to use the Foreign Certificate to obtain millions of dollars in \n\n5 \n \npayments for themselves, while invoking both humanitarian goals and the names of \nofficial entities, ranging from the Federal Reserve to the United Nations Security \nCouncil, in an effort to make their scheme appear legitimate. (AE 4(c), AE 6(c).) \n \n \nIn October 1998, the presiding judge (PJ) entered a default judgment against \nPablo in an SEC action involving the offer and attempt to sell the Foreign Certificate. \nThe final judgment ordered Pablo to pay a $75,000 penalty, and permanently enjoined \nhim from violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 \nand Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933. The PJ noted that Pablo had previously \nconsented to the entry of a preliminary injunction against him in June 1998. (AE 5(c), \nAE 6(c).) The PJ described the Foreign Papers utilizing Fabian\u2019s testimony: \n \n[Fabian] has described the [Foreign Certificate] in various ways at various \ntimes. [Fabian] told officials of the Bureau of Public Debt that the \nJapanese government had given the Certificate to [a former president of a \nLatin American country] for \u201cgood services rendered.\u201d (citations omitted.) \nDuring initial testimony before the SEC, Fabian stated that the Certificate \nwas \u201cpart of the debt settlement of the de[b]t Japan owed after World War \nII.\u201d (citations omitted.) According to a so-called \u201cConfidential Review,\u201d \nseemingly written and in any event expressly adopted by [Fabian], the \nCertificate was \u201cfor the purpose of Economic Aid, Economic Stabilization \nand Economic Development around the Globe.\u201d (citations omitted.) At his \ndeposition, [Fabian] testified that the aid, stabilization and development \nplan was developed by an entity known as the \u201cInternational Defense \nAssociation\u201d (\u201cIDA\u201d), which [Fabian] described as a cooperative effort of \nUnited States and Soviet intelligence agencies facilitated by the Catholic \nChurch and conceived by extraterrestrials from planet XV-9 which, \n[Fabian] states, is also known as \u201cAtlantis.\u201d (citations omitted.) (GE 7(c), p. \n3.) \n \n \nIn February 2000, the same PJ entered summary judgment against Fabian, et al. \nFabian was ordered to pay a $200,000 penalty, the maximum penalty allowed, and \npermanently enjoined from future violations of the federal securities laws. The PJ \ndescribed the purported holding history of the Foreign Certificate as claimed by Fabian \nand his wife: \n \nThe Holding History is a long, rambling, often incoherent statement that \ndiscusses, among others, Napoleon Bonaparte, Adolf Hitler, Senator \nEdward Kennedy, and former President Richard Nixon. The Holding \nHistory purports to provide \u201ccertain Classified data which is essential\u201d for \nunderstanding \u201cthe history as it relates to the Certificate and Account and \nits relation to how financial markets were/are created, maintained and \ncontrolled.\u201d (GE 7(c), p. 6.) \n \n \nOne of the most significant findings the PJ made in his decision was, \u201cThe \n[Foreign Certificate is a forgery.\u201d (GE 7(c), p. 3.) He added, \u201cThe [Fabians] know the \nCertificate is a forgery.\u201d (GE 7(c), p. 4.) \n\n6 \n \n \nPablo had told John that the Foreign Certificate had to go through a \u201cvalidation \nprocess\u201d to determine that it was \u201cvalid or not, whether [it was] fraudulent.\u201d (Tr. 52.) \nPablo was insistent that the Foreign Certificate go through the validation process at \nwhich time Fabian \u201cdecided on his own to circumvent [Pablo], to forge his signature, to \ntake the document out of safekeeping, and to try to pursue it on his own.\u201d (Tr. 52.) \nAccording to Pablo, \u201c. . . [Fabian] threatened [Pablo\u2019s] life, to the extent that [Pablo] who \nhad been staying with [Fabian] left without even gathering his belongings and eventually \nleft the country, because he felt his life (was) threatened.\u201d (Tr. 52.)  \n \n \nPablo fled to England and hired a solicitor, who according to Pablo, did not \nrepresent him well and he and the solicitor \u201cparted.\u201d (Tr. 53.) The solicitor purportedly \n\u201cstole\u201d $20,000 from Pablo. (John\u2019s SOR Response.) During his purported \nrepresentation by the solicitor, the SEC had served notice on the solicitor that Pablo \nwas to appear at a hearing in the United States. Pablo claims he did not receive notice \nof the hearing and a default judgment was entered against him, discussed supra. (Tr. \n54.)  \n \n \nWhile Pablo was in England, John visited him two times to make his own \nindependent inquiries about Pablo and his involvement with the Foreign Certificate. \nJohn met Pablo\u2019s solicitor and \u201cgot to interview with the CIA person that he was working \nwith.\u201d (Tr. 56.) This former CIA operative purportedly had access to large bearer bonds \nthat could be used for a transaction. Pablo investigated these bonds and determined \nthey were valid. The bonds later \u201cbecame invalid.\u201d One of the bonds was used by the \nCIA operative to secure an apartment shared by Pablo and the CIA operative. This led \nto Pablo and the CIA operative\u2019s arrest by the London police and confiscation of their \nbonds. After one week in jail, they were released and Pablo returned to the United \nStates in November 1998. (John\u2019s SOR Response, Tr. 196-197.)  \n \n \nIn spite of all that had transpired with Pablo, John concluded that Pablo was the \n\u201cvictim\u201d in the Foreign Certificate transaction, that Pablo was trying to pay investors \nback, that he was not a \u201ccrook,\u201d and that he never got his day in court with the SEC. (Tr. \n56.) At this time, John considers Pablo to be \u201cboth a friend and a business person \ndealing with him.\u201d (Tr. 57.) Pablo convinced John to loan him \u201csome money\u201d to retain \ncounsel to \u201cclear up the (SEC) matter.\u201d (Tr. 54.) John did loan Pablo money to retain \ncounsel, but Pablo did not clear up the SEC matter. (Tr. 54, 193-196.) \n \n \nIn July 2002, John discovered Pablo held dual citizenship with the United States \nand Columbia and held passports with both countries. (Tr. 57-58.) Having discovered \nPablo\u2019s dual citizenship, he disclosed this to a Defense Security Service (DSS) \nrepresentative. After extensive consultations with the DSS representative, they \nconcluded there was no foreign influence concern. (Tr. 58-59.) After 2002, John did not \nsee Pablo again until 2006. He does communicate frequently with him by telephone, \nhowever. (Tr. 59-60.)  \n \n \nJohn and Mary frequently see their two sons, daughter-in-law, and \ngranddaughter, all who live in the local area. John has two sisters residing in the United \nStates and has frequent contact with them. John and Mary also remain in frequent \n\n7 \n \ncontact with Mary\u2019s parents. (Tr. 252-254.) John has lived in the same community since \n1983, exercises his right to vote, is current on all of his taxes, and is involved in his \nchurch as an elder. (Tr. 255-256.) \n \n \nPablo became \u201cdesperate to obtain some of the money his grandfather had \npromised him. He knew of 100 million that had been deposited with his supposed \nillegitimate uncle and aunt in Yugoslavia.\u201d (John\u2019s SOR Response.) Pablo was unable \nto conduct business in the United States after the October 1998 SEC default judgment \nagainst him. Taking into account where he purportedly had family contacts and where \nhe might be able to conduct business, he left the United States in approximately 1998 to \ngo to Lichtenstein. Pablo claimed his family was friends with a member of the royal \nfamily and \u201cwell connected there.\u201d (GE 3(c), Tr. 54.) During this time, he had come up \nwith an idea \u201cto produce the security system that would be applicable to banking, and \nhe had great banking contacts, . . . . \u201c (Tr. 55.) \n \n \nOver John\u2019s objections, Pablo left the United States bound for Yugoslavia in \n\u201cearly \u201899\u201d to locate his uncle. John did not expect to hear from him again, but in early \n2000 Pablo asked him for help with his aunt who purportedly was seeking asylum from \nthe Yugoslavian government. In March 2000, John and Mary flew to Vienna to meet \nPablo and drove to Budapest, Hungary, to meet and assist his aunt. While at the United \nStates Embassy in Budapest, John and Mary were informed by Embassy personnel that \nPablo\u2019s aunt was a \u201ccon artist,\u201d who ran a banking scheme to lure investors and steal \ntheir money. During this trip, John, Mary, and Pablo discussed setting up a secure \nbanking system program. (John\u2019s SOR Response.) John, Mary, and Pablo then drove to \nLichtenstein. (Tr. 62.) Through his \u201cconnections,\u201d Pablo arranged a meeting for John \nwith the board of directors at a prominent bank for the purpose of pitching his secure \nbanking system program. (Tr. 62-74, 201-203.)  \n \n \nIn about 2000, John began loaning Pablo significant amounts of money. John \ntestified the cumulative amounts he loaned Pablo were approximately $410,000. (Tr. \n65.) John\u2019s SOR \u00b6 1.d. alleges that he provided personal loans totaling approximately \n$25,000 to establish a non-profit organization, and for Pablo\u2019s legal defense against the \n1998 SEC judgment against him. John admits providing approximately $5,000 each to \ntwo friends, who were associated with the non-profit organization for earnest money to \npurchase homes, but he did not provide money to the non-profit organization as alleged. \nJohn acknowledges that he did provide $10,000 to assist Pablo with his SEC legal \ndefense fees. (Tr.199-200, 215-216.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f. alleges that in about 2002, John made two separate low interest loans \nof $200,000 each, for a total of $400,000, to Pablo. John made these loans being fully \naware of the 1998 SEC judgment against Pablo, a judgment John believes is \u201cwithout \nmerit.\u201d These funds were loaned to Pablo \u201cto assist in doing the fund-raising for [the \nsecure banking system program].\u201d John loaned these amounts to Pablo knowing that \nhis parent company had only earned about $14,000 in gross income that year. (John\u2019s \nSOR Response, Tr. 67.) SOR \u00b6 1.g. alleges that John transferred about $408,000 from \n2000 to 2006 to Pablo, knowing that his parent company had only earned about \n$148,282 in gross income from 2002 to 2006. Applicant testified that this allegation was \n\n8 \n \nnot a separate sum from the $400,000 alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f., but rather referred to the \nsame $400,000. (Tr. 67-68.) In June or July 2002, John travelled to Germany to meet \nwith Pablo and provide him with the first $200,000 loan. In order to provide Pablo with \nthe second $200,000 loan, John had to secure the funds by borrowing the money on his \nlife insurance policy. (AE 3(c), Tr. 213-214.) All told, John loaned money to Pablo \nmoney 39 separate times. The first loan was for $9,000 on March 20, 2000 and the 39th \nand last loan was for $4,600 on December 6, 2006, for a grand total of $408,700.  \n \n \nPablo executed two separate promissory notes for $200,000 in which he \npromised to pay John back. (GE 2(c), GE 13(c), Tr. 219-221.) To date, Pablo has not \npaid John or Mary any of the money loaned to him. Because Pablo lives in Columbia, \nJohn cannot sue him for any funds owed him. John has not had any successful \nventures with Pablo during the 12 years he has known him. (Tr. 222.) In addition to \nvarious church members losing approximately $1,000,000 dollars through their \ninvestments with Pablo in the Foreign Certificate, there were two investors in \nLiechtenstein that lost \u201cabout 300,000\u201d in another venture. As far as John is aware, \nPablo\u2019s \u201cdebt would be contained within $3 million.\u201d (Tr. 265.)  \n \n \nJohn testified Pablo used these funds to live on, to make brochures, to travel and \nset up meetings, and basic business expenses. (Tr. 68.) Pablo was in Liechtenstein \nbecause his grandfather was \u201ca very close friend of [a royal family member].\u201d The royal \nfamily member \u201cwas ready to fund [the secure banking system program], up until the \nfact he found the SEC judgment. Once he found the SEC judgment, the deal fell apart.\u201d \n(Tr. 69.) The SEC judgment against Pablo \u201cdrove the Liechtenstein contacts away and \nPablo concluded his efforts in Liechtenstein were a failure. (Tr. 69.) At that point, Pablo \ndecided to move to Columbia in 2002 where his family was \u201cwell-known\u201d and where he \nhas remained ever since. (Tr. 69-70.) \n \n \nJohn\u2019s SOR \u00b6 1.h. alleged that he formed a Liechtenstein registered trust in 2000 \nfor the purpose of holding intellectual property rights to certain technologies he was \ndeveloping and that, as of August 22, 2009, the registered trust held intellectual \nproperty rights to his technologies. Applicant advised that the registered trust was \nformed by others with \u201csome minor assistance from me.\u201d John, aware of foreign \ninfluence concerns, ensured that he would have no foreign signature authority over the \nregistered trust. (John\u2019s SOR Response.) John disclosed this situation to a DSS \nrepresentative as it occurred. (Tr. 81.) \n \n \nJohn\u2019s SOR \u00b6 1.i. alleged that his parent company, where he serves as president \nwith a 77% interest, had a business relationship with a Liechtenstein company formed \nby the Liechtenstein registered trust referred to above to promote and sell his banking \nsecurity software. The SOR further alleged that this company was formed by the \nregistered trust by Pablo under the laws of Liechtenstein in the 2000 to 2001 timeframe. \nApplicant advised that the business relationship with the company formed by Pablo was \nconducted by a separate subsidiary company, not previously discussed, which provided \nan indirect tie to his parent company. Other companies were also tied to the company to \npromote and sell John\u2019s banking security software while waiting for funding. (John\u2019s \nSOR Response.) John did not have any ownership or financial interests in the \n\n9 \n \nLiechtenstein registered trust. He did not receive any form of compensation from the \ntrust, nor did he have any management authority over the registered trust. (Tr. 81-82.) \nThe success of the Liechtenstein registered trust was \u201cvery much dependent upon the \n[royal family member\u2019s] goodwill and the relationship Pablo\u2019s family had with him, so \nthat was very key, the reasons why Liechtenstein was chosen.\u201d (Tr. 83.)  \n \n \nThe last time John saw Pablo was for two days on October 31 and November 1, \n2006 when he travelled to Columbia to see him. John testified that Pablo has not \nreturned to the United States since he left the United States in 1998. Pablo did not invite \nJohn to his home because he lived in an \u201cunsafe\u201d neighborhood. Rather they met at a \nlocation near the airport. (Tr. 69, 224-226, 264.) John believes that he \u201chas some \nroommates\u201d and is friends with the President of Columbia. (Tr. 71-73, 240-241.) As far \nas John knows, Pablo works at a \u201cminor job (such) as selling real estate and his major \njob is still trying to work with these large antique financial instruments.\u201d At present, \nPablo\u2019s mother and sister live in the same community as John and Mary in a \u201cvery \nmodest\u201d residence. (Tr. 259.)  \n \n \nJohn explained that after the car accident in Columbia where Pablo\u2019s father, \nsister, and two brothers were killed, Pablo\u2019s family tried to kill his mother so they could \nhave young Pablo for themselves and raise him. After a foiled attempt by the family to \nkill her with \u201cbad drugs,\u201d she fled Columbia and moved to the United States. (Tr. 260.) \nAs Pablo grew up, he spent time living with his grandfather \u201cin luxury\u201d and alternatively \nwith his mother \u201cin poverty.\u201d (Tr. 260.) John testified that Pablo is not affiliated with nor \ndoes he work for the Columbian government. John is aware of his obligation to report \nany unauthorized contact by a foreign national and of his responsibilities to safeguard \nclassified information. (Tr. 73-74.) \n \n \nJohn explained why he continued to have faith in Pablo: \n \nWell, you know, as a Christian man, I try to discern how the Spirit is \ndirecting me, and in particular with [Pablo], I\u2019ve asked often whether this \nassociation should continue, and as far as I can discern, as I\u2019ve tested the \nSpirit, that I\u2019m not allowed to leave him. I\u2019ve tried, but it\u2019s \u2013 I cannot leave \nhim without a friend. I mean, most of his friends have deserted him, and \nit\u2019s tough for him. It\u2019s not easy living in poverty in Columbia. \n \nSo even though I would explore possibilities of, you know, disassociating \nmyself with him, I was never allowed to do that in the Spirit. There was \nalways a check in my spirit. (Tr. 88.) \n \n \nThe following is a colloquy between Department Counsel and John regarding his \nongoing relationship with Pablo: \n \nQ. Now, I think you said earlier that you\u2019ve considered severing your ties \nwith [Pablo] but you\u2019re not able to do that? \n \n\n10 \n \nA. Well, you know, I try to pray and, you know, seek God\u2019s direction in all \naspects of my life. And every time I would try to move away from my \nassociation with him (Pablo) I would (get) slapped down, you know, like, \nNo, you don\u2019t do that sort of thing. So, you know, even though I\u2019ve tried \nand, you know, I\u2019ve been very frustrated with him, you know, after July of \n2002, for example, I haven\u2019t felt like I\u2019ve been allowed to sever \nconnections.  \n \nQ. Does your wife want you to sever connections with him? \n \nA. She would prefer me to sever connections with him. \n \nQ. Do you maintain your relationship with him because he owes you \nmoney at all or is it not based on that reason? \n \nA. Well, obviously, there\u2019s some incentive to help him pay back and to pay \nothers back. But I would like to think it was more than that. You know, he\u2019s \n\u2013 last Sunday represented the 44th anniversary of his father, his sister and \ntwo brothers who were killed in an assassination as a truck forced their car \noff of a mountain road in Columbia. And since then it\u2019s been he and his \nmother. And it\u2019s been a tough life for him. \n \nAnd especially after he became a Christian and having all of those \nrelationships severed he\u2019s kind of an orphan out there. And so I have \nsome compassion for him on that standpoint. And if I can help him recover \nI would like to. (Tr. 241-242.) \n \n \nMary, like John, continues to believe in Pablo; however, she does not support \nJohn pursuing further business interests with Pablo. She acknowledged \u201csign[ing] off\u201d \non all of John\u2019s transactions with Pablo. Additionally, Mary testified at a federal grand \njury in 2002 that was investigating Pablo \u201cto track that money.\u201d To the best of Mary\u2019s \nknowledge, nothing came of the grand jury investigation. (Tr. 294-297.) \n \n \nJohn\u2019s SOR \u00b6 2.b. alleged that John falsified his May 2002 SF-86 by failing to list \nthat he formed a Liechtenstein registered trust for the purpose of holding intellectual \nproperty rights to certain technologies when asked whether he had any foreign property, \nbusiness connections, or financial interests. John discussed the situation with a DSS \nrepresentative and the representative determined that it was not necessary for John to \nlist the Liechtenstein registered trust on his SF-86. John further credibly testified that he \ndid not form the trust, that he never transferred any property to the trust, that he never \nhad any ownership interest in the Liechtenstein registered trust, that he had no control \nover the business affairs of the trust at any point, and that he never had signature \nauthority on any of the trust\u2019s accounts. (Tr. 93-94, 96-100, 228-232.) \n \n \nMary\u2019s SOR \u00b6 2.b. alleged that she falsified her May 2002 SF-86 rights by failing \nto list that she and John formed a Liechtenstein registered trust in 2000 for the purpose \nof holding intellectual property rights and that she served as corporate secretary in \n\n11 \n \nJohn\u2019s business and owns 14% of that business; and had a business relationship with a \nsubordinate company to fund and market secure banking system technologies. Mary \ncredibly testified and corroborated her SOR Response that she had no foreign \nproperties, that their subordinate company had pending relationships waiting for \nfunding, and that no intellectual property rights have been transferred. In short, she has \nno interest of any sort in the trust, and that she had no business connections with their \nsubordinate company. Her only involvement in the Liechtenstein registered trust was \nthe potential transfer of intellectual property to the trust at some point. She did not \nparticipate in the forming of the trust, is not a trustee, nor has she ever held a position of \nauthority or responsibility within the registered trust. (Mary\u2019s SOR Response, Tr. 286-\n289.) \n \n \nOn October 8, 2005, John and Mary filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. On October \n12, 2005, they notified the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO) by \nletter of their bankruptcy filing. (AE 8(c), Tr. 101-102.) John\u2019s business and personal \nincome dropped considerably from 2000 to 2005. As a result of expenses and business \ndropping off, John and Mary\u2019s cash flow was reduced to the point that they took out a \nhome equity line of credit, borrowed against a life insurance policy, borrowed \napproximately $120,000 from Mary\u2019s parents, and live an austere lifestyle as compared \nto their previous lifestyle. (AE 9-15, Tr. 102-122.)  \n \n \nTheir credit reports and financial records over those years show a steady decline \nin their financial situation. John and Mary\u2019s Chapter 7 Summary of Schedules reflected \ntotal assets of $291,781.22 and total liabilities of $380,497.07. They were awarded a \ndischarge in January 2006. (GE 9(c) \u2013 GE 12(c), GE 14(c) \u2013 GE 15(c), GE 16(c).) At \npresent, John and Mary do not have any credit cards and pay cash for everything. They \nare able to meet their monthly expenses through Mary\u2019s salary, and cash gifts from their \nyoungest son and Mary\u2019s parents. John and Mary live a modest lifestyle and are current \non all of their monthly expenses. Taking into account their collective income sources, \nJohn and Mary\u2019s annual income is approximately $68,000. (Tr. 123, 235-237.) John \ntestified that Pablo\u2019s failure to pay back the $400,000 loan was a contributing factor to \nhis filing bankruptcy. (Tr. 228.) \n \n \n \nJohn has never owned any real estate in a foreign country nor has he ever had \nan interest in a foreign bank or investment account. He has no plans to move or retire to \nLiechtenstein or to Columbia. (Tr. 100-101.) Like John, Mary has never owned any real \nestate in a foreign country nor has she ever had an interest in a foreign bank or \ninvestment account. (Tr. 289-290.) \n \n \nJohn testified that Pablo was aware that John and Mary were at a DOHA hearing \nand that their problems with DOHA were caused in large part by their association and \ndealings with him. Pablo\u2019s reaction to the fallout he caused John and Mary is, \u201c[h]e and \nhis family are not happy about that.\u201d To the best of John\u2019s knowledge, none of the \ninvestors to include John and Mary who lost money through their investments with \nPablo has ever been paid back. (Tr. 266-267.) John later discovered that after the SEC \nfound Fabian guilty of securities fraud and fined and issued a permanent injunction \n\n12 \n \n                                                          \nagainst him, his state bar disbarred him. Fabian then killed his wife and two teenage \nchildren and committed suicide in June 1991. (Tr. 267-268.) \n \nCharacter Evidence \n \nThree character witnesses testified on John and Mary\u2019s behalf: (1) a personal \nreference who is a retired Air Force Major General and is now working as an aerospace \nengineer for a defense contractor; (2) a personal reference they met through their \nchurch who retired as the head of an major insurance company\u2019s internal audit \ndepartment and is now working as a maintenance man for the local housing authority; \nand (3) a personal reference they met through their church who is the owner of a small \nresearch and development business. In addition to being personal friends, all three \nwitnesses have been involved in a business relationship with John and Mary in varying \ndegrees. The second witness invested $310,000 from his retirement account in the \nForeign Certificate and lost the entire amount. The collective testimony of these \nwitnesses supports the notion that John and Mary are trustworthy and responsible \nindividuals. (Tr. 34-50, 127-176.) \n \nJohn and Mary also submitted letters from a DSS representative that \ndocumented a seven-year track record from 2001 to 2008 of their company\u2019s \ncompliance with DoD security procedures. Their company earned consistent grades of \n\u201cSatisfactory\u201d during this period. (AE 1-8.) They also submitted a letter dated June 8, \n2000 from the U.S. Department of Commerce that granted them a license to export \ncertain technology to Liechtenstein. (AE 9.) Lastly, they submitted company profit and \nloss statements from 2000 to 2006 that reflected a steady decline in business revenues. \n(AE 9-15.) \n \nColumbia2 \n \nColombia is a constitutional, multiparty democracy with a population of \napproximately 44.8 million. Colombia is the second most populous country in South \nAmerica. Any person born in Colombia is considered a Colombian citizen. \n \n \nThe Department of State warns U.S. citizens of the dangers of travel to \nColombia. Violence by narco-terrorist groups continues to affect some rural areas and \ncities. The potential for violence by terrorists and other criminal elements exists in all \nparts of the country. Terrorists and other criminal organizations continue to kidnap and \nhold persons of all nationalities and occupations for use as bargaining chips. No one is \nimmune from kidnapping on the basis of occupation, nationality or other factors. U.S. \nGovernment officials and their families have strict limitations on travel to and within \nColombia due to these dangers.  Kidnap or murder victims in Colombia have included \njournalists, missionaries, scientists, human rights workers, and business people, as well \nas tourists and even small children. Approximately 298 kidnappings committed by \nterrorist groups and for-profit kidnap gangs were reported to authorities in 2007.  \n \n \n2 The contents of this section are taken in whole or in part from Exs. I and II, which are duplicate \ndocuments. \n\n13 \n \nRobbery and other violent crimes are common in major cities while small towns and \nrural areas can be extremely dangerous due to the presence of narco-terrorists. \n \n \nThe Secretary of State has designated three Colombian groups \u2013 the \nRevolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), the National Liberation Army (ELN), \nand the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC) \u2013 as Foreign Terrorist \nOrganizations. These groups have carried out bombings and other attacks in and \naround major urban areas, including against civilian targets. Terrorist groups have also \ntargeted critical infrastructure (e.g., water, oil, gas, and electricity), public recreational \nareas, and modes of transportation. The FARC has targeted civilians, government \nrepresentatives and politicians, soldiers, and the civilian infrastructure. Three Irish \nRepublican Army members assisted in training the FARC on IRA bomb tactics in \nColombia.  FARC held three U.S. government contractors -- all U.S. citizens -- hostage \nfor five years, until they were rescued on July 2, 2008 by the Colombian military. Some \nborder areas have become terrorist safe havens. \n \n \nAlthough the government\u2019s respect for human rights continued to improve, \nserious problems remain.  Unlawful and extrajudicial killings, forced disappearances, \ninsubordinate military personnel who collaborate with criminal groups, torture and \nmistreatment of detainees, overcrowded and insecure prisons, and other serious human \nrights abuses were reported during 2007. Illegal armed groups and terrorist groups \ncommitted the majority of human rights violations\u2013including political killings and \nkidnappings, forced disappearances, torture, and other serious human rights abuses. \n \nPolicies \n \nThe President of the United States has the authority to control access to \ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is \nsufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 527 (1988). The President has authorized the Secretary of \nDefense to grant eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. The UNITED \nSTATES Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These AGs are not inflexible rules of \nlaw. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and \npresent, favorable and unfavorable to reach his decision.  \n \n\n14 \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, a \nclearance decision is merely an indication that the Applicant has or has not met the \nstrict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing \na clearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue [his or her] security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly \nabove, I conclude the following with respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR: \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nAG \u00b6 6 explains the Government\u2019s concern about \u201cforeign contacts and interests\u201d \nstating: \n \n[I]f the individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, [he or \nshe] may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, \norganization, or government in a way that is not in UNITED STATES \ninterests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. \n\n15 \n \nAdjudication under this Guideline can and should consider the identity of \nthe foreign country in which the foreign contact or financial interest is \nlocated, including, but not limited to, such considerations as whether the \nforeign country is known to target United States citizens to obtain \nprotected information and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nAG \u00b6 7 indicates three conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case, including: \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information; and \n \n(e) a substantial business, financial, or property interest in a foreign \ncountry, or in any foreign-owned or foreign-operated business, which \ncould subject the individual to heightened risk of foreign influence or \nexploitation. \n \nThe mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, \nas a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative or \nfriend lives in a foreign country and an applicant has contacts with that relative or friend, \nthis factor alone is sufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could \npotentially result in the compromise of classified information. See ISCR Case No. 03-\n02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001).  \n \nAlthough Pablo is not a relative, there is no question that he is a person with \nwhom John, and to a lesser extent Mary, maintain a close personal and business \nrelationship. Pablo is a dual citizen of the U.S. and Columbia and a resident of \nColumbia. Pablo owes John and Mary over $400,000, an amount they hope to recover \nfrom him. John maintains frequent e-mail and telephone contact with Pablo and has \nvisited him in Columbia. This close relationship creates a potential risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion meriting a close \nexamination of all circumstances. The Government produced substantial evidence of \nthe three disqualifying conditions under AGs \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), (b), and 7(e). Although the \nGovernment alleged that John and Mary traveled to Liechtenstein in 2001 for the \npurpose of conducting business, there is no evidence that the business was of \nconsequence. Furthermore, the Government did not present evidence at the hearing \ndemonstrating or suggesting that John and Mary\u2019s involvement in Liechtenstein was a \nconcern. \n \n\n16 \n \nThe burden shifted to John and Mary to produce evidence and prove mitigating \ncondition(s). The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \nGovernment. \n \n \nThree Foreign Influence Mitigating Conditions under Guideline \u00b6 8 are potentially \napplicable to these disqualifying conditions: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; and \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n \nJohn and Mary are not bound to Pablo as a blood relative or through marriage, \nbut rather through years of friendship and a series of adverse financial dealings. John \nhas demonstrated his close ties with Pablo by frequent contact, his visit to Columbia in \n2006, and professed friendship. Pablo purportedly makes his living selling real estate \nand dealing in financial instruments. From the evidence presented, Pablo is not affiliated \nwith the Columbian government save for his claim to be a friend of the Columbian \nPresident. The record does not identify what influence, if any, the Columbian \ngovernment could exert on Pablo as a result of being a resident citizen of Columbia. \nHowever, Pablo\u2019s presence in Columbia, and John\u2019s foreign travel, professed \nfriendship, and financial dealings creates concerns under this Guideline. As such, the \nburden shifted to John and Mary to show Pablo\u2019s living in Columbia and travel there \ndoes not create security risks.  \n \n\u201c[T]he nature of the foreign government involved in the case, and the intelligence-\ngathering history of that government are important evidence that provides context for all \nthe other evidence of the record . . .\u201d See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-0776 at 3 (App. Bd. \nSept. 26, 2006); see also ISCR Case No. 02-07772 at 7 (App. Bd. Aug. 28, 2003). As \nnoted supra under the subheading \u201cColumbia,\u201d the U.S. Secretary of State has \ndesignated three Columbian groups -- FARC, ELN, and AUC as Foreign Terrorist \nOrganizations. Although the Columbian government\u2019s respect for human rights \ncontinues to improve, terrorist groups operating within Columbia have committed the \nmajority of human rights violations to include political killings and kidnapping, forced \ndisappearances, torture, and other serious human rights abuses. \n\n17 \n \nJohn denies having \u201cdivided loyalties\u201d between the United States and any foreign \ncountry. It should be noted Applicant\u2019s allegiance to the United States was not \nchallenged in this proceeding. The issue is rather a positional one.  \n \n[Guideline B] hinges not on what choice Applicant might make if he is \nforced to choose between his loyalty to his family and the United States, \nbut rather hinges on the concept that Applicant should not be placed in a \nposition where he is forced to make such a choice. ISCR Case No. 03-\n15205 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jan. 21, 2005). \n \nOn balance, John has not met his burden of showing there is \u201clittle likelihood that \n[his relationship with Pablo in Columbia] could create a risk for foreign influence or \nexploitation.\u201d John\u2019s continued and ongoing relationship with his friend, Pablo, and the \nnature of unlawful activities in Columbia by terrorist organizations places Applicant in \njust this position, given his close relationship with Pablo and Pablo\u2019s continued \npresence and connection with Columbia.  \n \nHowever, John and Mary are able to receive partial credit under AG \u00b6 8(a). Pablo \npurportedly maintains a non-political low key position in Columbia. Full application of AG \n\u00b6 8(a) is also precluded given his past SEC judgment and inability to find employment in \nhis profession not to mention the numerous investors, to include John and Mary, who \nplaced their trust and confidence in Pablo and suffered financially. John and Mary\u2019s loss \nin excess of $400,000 directly contributed to their 2005 bankruptcy. \n \nJohn and Mary are able to receive full credit under AG \u00b6 8(b). Their relationship \nwith Pablo in Columbia is minimal when compared and contrasted with their immediate \nrelatives in the United States John and Mary have \u201csuch deep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the United States, [they] can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the United States interest.\u201d Their two living sons and \nimmediate relatives are U.S.-born citizens and reside in the United States, and they are \nfully inculcated with U.S. values. John and Mary were born, raised, and educated in the \nUnited States. John and Mary have worked with the U.S. Government as a defense \ncontractor with dedication and distinction for years. John and Mary\u2019s property and \ninvestments are in the United States, and they have no property or investments in \nColumbia or in any other foreign country. They have many friends and colleagues in the \nUnited States. They are loyal, dedicated U.S. citizens, who exercise their rights of U.S. \ncitizenship. John and Mary provided three reputable witnesses, to corroborate their \nloyalty and trustworthiness.  \n \nJohn and Mary are also able to receive full credit under AG \u00b6 8(e) as a result of \ntheir keeping the DSS fully apprised of their association with Pablo and travel to \nColumbia. They have been completely open and forthright with Government officials \nfrom the onset of this affair. John and Mary have no assets in Columbia except two \nvirtually uncollectable promissory notes as opposed to all of their assets being in the \nUnited States. A thorough comparison of their relationship to the United States as \ncompared to their relationship with Columbia is further discussed under the Whole-\nPerson Concept, infra. \n\n18 \n \n                                                          \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nAG \u00b6 15 explains the Government\u2019s concern under this Guideline: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes three conditions that could raise a security concern and may \nbe disqualifying in this case: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;  \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning \nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent \nmedical authority, or other official government representative; and \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not \nproperly safeguard protected information. \n \nA statement is false when it is made deliberately, i.e. knowingly and willfully. An \nomission of relevant and material information is not deliberate if the person genuinely \nforgot about it, inadvertently overlooked it, misunderstood the question, or genuinely \nthought the information did not need to be reported. 3 \n \n3 The Appeal Board has cogently explained the process for analyzing falsification cases, stating: \n \n(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has the burden of \nproving falsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove \nan applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the omission occurred; and (c) a Judge must \nconsider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or \ncircumstantial evidence concerning the applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the \nomission occurred. [Moreover], it was legally permissible for the Judge to conclude \nDepartment Counsel had established a prima facie case under Guideline E and the \nburden of persuasion had shifted to the applicant to present evidence to explain the \nomission.  \n \n\n19 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                          \nThe issue here is the truthfulness of John and Mary\u2019s respective statements \nregarding their foreign holdings. AG \u00b6 17(f), infra, provides a condition that could \nmitigate security concerns in this case, stating, \u201cthe information was unsubstantiated or \nfrom a source of questionable reliability.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(f) fully applies. \n \nHaving had the opportunity to listen to their testimony and observe their \ndemeanor, their explanations as set forth in the findings of fact are accepted as \ncredible. John and Mary took the extra step of informing a DSS representative regarding \nthe registered trust and after a meaningful discussion concluded that it was not \nnecessary to list foreign holdings as alleged. Furthermore, and based on the evidence, \nJohn and Mary answered the question regarding their foreign holdings truthfully. \nAdmittedly, the relationship that existed between the parties and their respective level of \ninvolvement could understandably lead to confusion.  \n \nHaving dealt with falsification concerns, I now move on to what I view as the crux \nof this case and that is John and Mary\u2019s ongoing relationship with Pablo. This \nrelationship began at John and Mary\u2019s church in approximately 1996. From the onset, \nPablo made some rather extraordinary claims about his very wealthy background, being \nlinked to the Rothschild family fortune, and being in the lineage to the King of Israel. \nPablo, who was born into a Jewish family, claimed that his family disowned him \nbecause he had converted to Christianity, but his grandfather, a former Columbian \nambassador, left him a substantial fortune worth millions. Pablo related that his \ngrandfather had put monies away at various sites.  \n \nRecord evidence identified at least four schemes associated with Pablo. First, \naround 1977 Pablo was involved with the Foreign Certificate, discussed at length, \nsupra. John and Mary did not invest in this particular venture, but fellow church \nmembers did and paid dearly for placing their trust in Pablo. Collectively, they lost \napproximately $1 million. One member, who was the second witness to testify at John \nand Mary\u2019s hearing, lost $310,000 from his retirement account. In June 1998, the SEC \nfiled a complaint against Fabian, Pablo, et al, alleging that the Foreign Certificate was a \nsham document and that Pablo and others were part of a fraudulent scheme to use the \nCertificate to obtain millions of dollars for themselves. The SEC entered a default \njudgment against Pablo ordering him to pay a $75,000 fine and permanently enjoined \nhim from future trading or investing in the United States. \n \nSecond, in 1998 Pablo was arrested in London along with a \u201cformer CIA \noperative\u201d and placed in jail for one week based on their involvement with fraudulent \nbearer bonds. Third, in 2000 Pablo requested that John and Mary assist him in getting \nhis purported aunt asylum from the Yugoslavian government. After traveling to Europe, \nJohn and Mary were informed at the U.S. Embassy in Budapest, Hungary that the \n\u201caunt\u201d was a con artist involved in fraudulent banking transactions. Fourth, in 2002, \nPablo told John and Mary that he had $40 million in a security house in Amsterdam. He \nasked to borrow $200,000 from John and Mary to pay a storage fee to the security \n \nISCR Case No. 03-10380 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 6, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-23133 (App. Bd. June 9, \n2004)).  \n\n20 \n \nhouse so that he could access the $40 million. John and Mary loaned Pablo the \n$200,000, but there was no money in the storage house. \n \nDespite their knowledge of Pablo\u2019s involvement in these scams, their knowledge \nof the SEC judgment, and their knowledge of an FBI investigation involving Pablo, John \nand Mary refuse to believe that Pablo is culpable in any of these instances. Instead, \nthey view him as a victim and continue to place their faith in him. In spite of Pablo\u2019s \ntrack record of divesting substantial amounts of money from numerous investors, John \nand Mary decided to go into a business venture with him in 2000. John and Mary \nbelieved that Pablo could help them acquire funding for a secure banking system \ninvented by John. Over the years, John and Mary made 39 separate loans, the first in \n2000 and the last in 2006 for a total of $408,700. Pablo has not repaid one cent of the \nmoney that John and Mary loaned him, nor have they ever had a successful business \nventure with him. The record is void of anyone ever having had a successful business \nventure with Pablo. The record further demonstrates that Pablo has associated with \nquestionable and unsavory characters involved in fraudulent schemes such as his \n\u201caunt\u201d in Yugoslavia and Fabian.  \n \nBefore John and Mary met Pablo, they were financially secure. In 2005, having \ndepleted their savings, they were forced to file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. Their \nnumerous loans to Pablo over time placed them in financial jeopardy and directly \ncontributed to their financial instability. Their total liabilities on their Summary of \nSchedules are $380,497.07. It is quite clear that they would not be in their predicament \nhad they not loaned Pablo $408,700. Furthermore, this was not an isolated loan, but 39 \nseparate loans over time. Everyone who invested with Pablo lost all of their investment. \nPablo\u2019s abysmal track record should have served as a red flag. In order to remain \nsolvent today, John and Mary have had to rely on the generosity of their son and Mary\u2019s \nparents. In spite of all this, John and Mary continue to have faith in Pablo and refuse to \nsever their ties with him. They refuse to see him for what he is \u2013 a con artist. This \nsevere error in judgment raises grave concerns about John and Mary\u2019s suitability to hold \nsecurity clearances.   \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides seven conditions that could potentially mitigate security \nconcerns about his personal conduct: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \n\n21 \n \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress;  \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or \noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules \nand regulations. \n \nFor reasons discussed supra, I find none of the mitigating conditions under this \nconcern applicable to mitigate concerns arising under disqualifying condition \u00b6 16(c). \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 18 explains the Government\u2019s concern under this Guideline: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides two financial considerations disqualifying conditions that could \nraise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \nJohn and Mary\u2019s history of delinquent debt is established by their admissions and the \nevidence presented. As noted supra, they filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in October \n2005 and listed $380,497.07 worth of liabilities. Their unsecured nonpriority debts were \ndischarged in January 2006. And, Pablo\u2019s numerous unpaid loans directly contributed to \ntheir filing bankruptcy. The Government established the disqualifying conditions in AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c).  \n \n  \nFive financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) through(e) \nare potentially applicable:  \n \n\n22 \n \n                                                          \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is partially applicable. Until John and Mary filed for bankruptcy in \n2005, they had maintained financial responsibility. Their credit worthiness and ability to \npay their bills was never an issue. They were making a comfortable living and ran a \nsuccessful business. However, I am unable to give them full credit under this condition \nbecause of the ongoing questionable judgment they exercise vis-\u00e0-vis Pablo, discussed \nsupra, and which played a significant role in their filing for bankruptcy. Concerns remain \nregarding John and Mary\u2019s continued misplaced trust and faith in Pablo. \n  \nUnder AG \u00b6 20(b), John and Mary receive partial credit because the business \ndownturn they experienced was largely beyond their control and they acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances. However, their providing numerous loans to Pablo over time \nled to their adverse financial situation and does not demonstrate they acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances.4  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is partially applicable because John and Mary underwent financial \ncounseling in order to complete the bankruptcy process. AG \u00b6 20(d) is partially \napplicable because John and Mary\u2019s debt was discharged following bankruptcy.5 AG \u00b6 \n \n4 \u201cEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside \nhis [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable \nmanner when dealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. \n12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is \nwhether he maintained contact with his creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep his \ndebts current. \n \n\n23 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                          \n20(e) is not applicable because John and Mary did not dispute the legitimacy of their \ndebts. \n \nFinancial considerations have a judgment component in the concern that \ncontinues even though John and Mary have no delinquent debts. This judgment \ncomponent is best addressed under Guideline E, supra. I further note that John and \nMary have been and are current on their monthly bills since they were awarded a \nbankruptcy discharge in 2006. Accordingly, I find for John and Mary under Guideline F \nbecause the same conduct is duplicated under both guidelines. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \n In addition to the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions as \ndiscussed previously, I have considered the general adjudicative guidelines related to \nthe whole person concept under Directive \u00b6 E2.2.1. \u201cUnder the whole person concept, \nthe Administrative Judge must not consider and weigh incidents in an applicant\u2019s life \nseparately, in a piecemeal manner. Rather, the Judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s \nsecurity eligibility by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s conduct and \ncircumstances.\u201d6 The directive lists nine adjudicative process factors (APF) which are \nused for \u201cwhole person\u201d analysis.   \n \nBecause foreign influence does not involve misconduct, voluntariness of \nparticipation, rehabilitation and behavior changes, etc., the eighth APF, \u201cthe potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress,\u201d Directive \u00b6 E2.2.1.8, is the most relevant of \nthe nine APFs to this adjudication.7 In addition to the eighth APF, other \u201c[a]vailable, \n \n5 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood-faith\u201d effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant \nmust present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \nsome other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does \nnot define the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the concept of \ngood-faith \u2018requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 Accordingly, an applicant must \ndo more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as \nbankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition].  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd.

Ultimately, the \nclearance decision is \u201can overall common sense determination.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E2.2.3. \n \nThe Appeal Board requires the whole person analysis address \u201cevidence of an \napplicant\u2019s personal loyalties; the nature and extent of an applicant\u2019s family\u2019s ties to the \nU.S. relative to his [or her] ties to a foreign country; his or her ties social ties within the \nU.S.; and many others raised by the facts of a given case.\u201d ISCR Case No. 04-00540 at \n7 (App. Bd. Jan. 5, 2007). \n \n \nI have carefully considered Applicant\u2019s family connections and personal \nconnections to Columbia. Several circumstances weigh against Applicant in the whole \nperson analysis. First, three foreign terrorist organizations have been identified by the \nU.S. Secretary of State that are operating within Columbia. Illegal armed terrorist groups \ncommitted human rights violations to include political killings and kidnappings, forced \ndisappearances, torture, and other serious human rights abuses. Although Columbia \nand the United States enjoy a cordial relationship, the existence these terrorist groups \nand their concomitant internal problems within Columbia remain a concern. Second, \nJohn and Mary\u2019s close friend Pablo lives in Columbia. Pablo has an outstanding SEC \njudgment against him among other concerns. Third, John visited Pablo at least one time \nin Columbia in 2006 and remains in frequent contact with him by e-mail and telephone. \nThese contacts and visit are collective manifestations of strong affection and the regard \nJohn and or Mary have for their friend, Pablo. \n \n \nThere is significant mitigating evidence that weighs towards finding in John and \nMary\u2019s favor with regard to this concern. They were born, raised, and educated in the \nUnited States. They raised their children in the United States. All of their immediate \nfamily members are in the United States. They own real property in the United States, \nare involved in their community, and exercise all rights of U.S. citizenship. Their \nassociation with Columbia begins and ends with their one close friend, Pablo, who lives \nand resides in Columbia.  \n \nJohn and Mary maintain much more frequent contact with their U.S.-based family \nand friends than they do with their friend, Pablo, residing in Columbia. Their ties to the \nUnited States are stronger than their ties to Pablo in Columbia. There is no evidence \nthat John and Mary have ever taken any action which could cause potential harm to the \nUnited States.8 They take their loyalty to the United States very seriously, and they \nhave worked diligently for many years as a Government contractor/employer. The \nrecord contains no evidence that John and Mary have conflicted loy\n \n \nI considered the totality of John and Mary\u2019s ties to Columbia. Columbia and the \nUnited States enjoy a friendly relationship. Apart from the internal problems within \nColumbia, which are not endorsed by the Columbian government, Columbia is a \nmultiparty democracy, whose government\u2019s respect for human rights continues to \n \n \n8 The Government does not have the burden of providing such evidence. \n \n\n25 \n \n                                                          \nimprove. There is no evidence in the record to support the notion that the Columbian \ngovernment engages in an adversarial relationship with the United States. \n \n \nIn the unlikely event that John and Mary\u2019s friend, Pablo, in Columbia was \nsubjected to coercion or duress from a terrorist group within Columbia, I find that \nbecause of their deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, \nthat they would resolve any attempt to exert pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress \nin favor of the United States. Noteworthy and given great weight are John and Mary\u2019s \nlifetime of being loyal U.S. citizens. Lastly, their witnesses provided compelling \nendorsements on their behalf. \n \n \nThis case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into consideration all \nrelevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful \nanalysis. This analysis must answer the question whether there is a legitimate concern \nunder the facts presented that John and Mary may have divided loyalties or act in a way \nadverse to U.S. interests or some attempt may be made to exploit Pablo in such a way \nthat these U.S. citizens would have to choose between their pledged loyalty to the \nUnited States and their friend. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, \nall the facts and circumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude John and \nMary have mitigated the security concerns pertaining to foreign influence.   \n \nWhile I am able to reach a favorable conclusion with respect to foreign influence \nand financial considerations concerns, I am unable to reach the same conclusion with \nrespect to personal conduct concerns. As I mentioned at the outset, I consider John and \nMary to be decent, honorable, hard working, responsible parents, and loyal U.S. \ncitizens. I cannot, however, overcome the concerns I have regarding the judgment they \nexercised and continue to exercise by their misplaced trust and confidence in their \nfriend, Pablo.  \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d9 and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the Guidelines. John and \nMary have not completely mitigated or overcome the Government\u2019s case. For the \nreasons stated, I conclude they are not eligible for access to classified information. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n9See ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd.

Item 4.\n1\nId.\n2\n2\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant is a 45-year-old employee of a defense contractor seeking eligibility for a position\nof public trust.  Credit reports show, and Applicant admits, she accumulated approximately eight\ndelinquent debts, totaling over $10,000.  She has not explained how she accumulated the delinquent\ndebt.  She claims she paid two small debts, but submitted no documents to support such payments.\nShe stated she would make arrangements to pay the remaining debt, but provided no information on\nany arrangements made or contemplated.  She has not mitigated security concerns for financial\nconsiderations.  Eligibility for a position of public trust is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn December 5, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearing and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision to deny an application for a position\nof public trust for Applicant.  The action was taken under Department of Defense Regulation 5200.2-\nR, Personnel Security Program (January 1987), as amended (Regulation), and Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), using the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG), issued\nby the President on December 29, 2005, and implemented by the Department of Defense on\nSeptember 1, 2006.  The revised guidelines were provided to Applicant and she was aware that the\ncase would be adjudicated under those guidelines.  Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on\nDecember 11, 2006.  The SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations).  Applicant answered the SOR in writing on January 19, 2007, admitting the eight\nfactual allegations under Guideline F with explanation.  She elected to have the matter decided on\nthe written record in lieu of a hearing.\nDepartment Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written case on March 30, 2007.  Applicant\nreceived a complete file of relevant material (FORM) on April 10, 2007, and was provided the\nopportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the disqualifying\nconditions.  She did not provide any additional information.  The case was assigned to me on June\n14, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant is a 45-year-old employee of a defense contractor.  She is a high school graduate\nwho has worked as a clinical care coordinator for a defense contract for over 12 years.  She is\nmarried with one child.1\nApplicant submitted a Questionnaire for a Public Trust Position on February 11, 2005.2\n\nItem 5 (Credit report, dated May 3, 2005), Item 6 (Credit report, dated August 28, 2006); and Item 8 (Credit\n3\nreport, dated March 30, 2007).\nItem 2, SOR.\n4\nItem 3, Response to SOR, dated January 19, 2007.\n5\nItem 7 (Interrogatories, dated October 23, 2006).\n6\nDepartment of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n7\nRegulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1.\n8\n3\nSubsequent investigation of credit reports shows Applicant has delinquent debts.   The SOR lists\n3\neight delinquent debts that are of security concern.  In her response to the SOR, Applicant admits\nthe factual allegations of each debt.  The delinquent debts are a medical debt collection account for\n$95 from February 2000; a collection account for $33 for a cell phone account from July 2004; a\ncollection account for a credit card for $1,331 from July 2004; an automobile gasoline credit card\ncharged off account for $772 from July 2004; another automobile gasoline credit card charged off\naccount for $1,197 from September 2004; a computer purchase charged off account for $1,469 from\nDecember 2004; a store charged off account for $1,176 from December 2004; and a bank credit card\ncharged off account for $4,036 from February 2005.   Applicant noted that she paid the $95 and $33\n4\ncollection accounts in January 2007, but provided no proof of such payments.  She admits to the\n$1,331 debt with no explanation.  She admits to the remaining debts, and states she is making\narrangements to pay the debts but provides no proof of such an agreement.   \n5\nApplicant states she contacted a financial services company but terminated them when they\nrefused to settled with creditors.  She states she was paying the financial services company $115 per\nmonth.  She presented no prove of a contract with the company or any payments made under a\ncontract.  She also states she has hired a certified public accountant (CPA) to assist her with the other\ndebts.6\nPOLICIES\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national\nsecurity and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . .\nthat will give that person access to such information.\u201d   To be eligible to occupy an Information\n7\nSystems Position designated ADP II/III, an applicant must meet the security guidelines contained in\nthe Regulation.  The standard that must be met is that based on all available information, the person\u2019s\nloyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that assigning the person to sensitive duties is clearly\nconsistent with the interests of national security.8\nThe Regulation sets out the adjudicative guidelines for making trustworthiness determinations.\nAppendix 8 of the Regulations sets forth adjudicative guidelines for determining trustworthiness, and\nlists the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions for each guideline.  The adjudicative\nguideline at issue in this case are:\n\nAG \u00b6 29(a).\n9\nDoD 5200.2-R, \u00b6 C8.2.1.\n10\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n11\nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002); see Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n12\nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \n13\nISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996) (quoting DISCR Case No. 92-1106 (App. Bd. Oct. 7,\n14\n1993))\nEgan, 484 U.S. at 531; see Directive \u00b6 E2.2.2.\n15\n4\nGuideline F - Financial Considerations: A security concern exists because a failure or inability\nto live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor\nself-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which\ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect\nclassified information.  An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to\nengage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those\nwhich would mitigate security concerns, pertaining to the adjudicative guideline are set forth and\ndiscussed in the conclusions section below.\nThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.  An administrative\njudge must apply the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d and consider and carefully weigh the available, reliable\ninformation about the person.  An administrative judge should consider: (1) the nature, extent, and\nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the applicant\u2019s age and maturity at the\ntime of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation\nand other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation of recurrence.9\nDoD contractor personnel are afforded the rights to the procedures contained in the DoD\nDirective before any final unfavorable access determination may be made.   Initially, the Government\n10\nmust present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR that disqualify or may disqualify the\nApplicant from being eligible for access to classified information.   Thereafter, Applicant is\n11\nresponsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts.   An applicant \u201chas\n12\nthe ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or\ncontinue his security clearance.\u201d   \u201c[T]he Directive presumes there is a nexus or rational connection\n13\nbetween proven conduct under any of the criteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security\nsuitability.\u201d   \u201cAny doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with\n14\nnational security will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d   Each clearance decision must\n15\nbe fair, impartial, and a commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and\ncircumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors listed in new adjudicative guidelines.  A\nperson granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the government.\n\nSee Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7.\n16\n5\nThe government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to\nwhom it grants access to classified information.  The decision to deny an individual a security\nclearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.   It is merely an\n16\nindication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines have established for issuing a clearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI carefully considered all of the facts in evidence and the legal standards discussed above.  I\nreach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the SOR.\nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts from credit reports and admitted by Applicant brings the matter\nwithin Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions (FC DC) \u00b6 19(a) Inability or unwillingness\nto satisfy debts, FC DC \u00b6 19(b) indebtedness caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending and the\nabsence of any evidence of willingness or intent to pay the debt or establish a realistic plan to pay\nthe debt, and FC DC \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  Applicant admits the\ndebts, and provided no explanation how or why each delinquent debt was accumulated.  She\npresented no evidence of payment or a plan to pay the debts.  She accumulated debt because she was\nspending more than she had the ability to pay.  I conclude the above disqualifying conditions have\nbeen established.\nAppellant\u2019s answer to the SOR raises Financial Consideration Mitigating Conditions (FC MC)\n\u00b6 20(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances\nthat it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgement, FC MC \u00b6 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial\nproblem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g. loss of employment, a business downturn,\nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted\nresponsibly under the circumstances, FC MC \u00b6 20(c) the person has received or is receiving\ncounseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or\nis under control, and FC MC 20(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue\ncreditors or other wise resolve debts.  Applicant\u2019s debts are current since she has not paid or resolved\nthem.  The debts became delinquent under normal circumstances in 2000, 2004, and 2005.  She had\nmany years to begin repaying even the smallest debts and has not done so.  She states she paid two\nsmall debts but presents no information to confirm such payments.  She states that she will make\narrangements to pay the remaining debts but presents no proof of such arrangements.  An intention\nto pay debts in the future is not sufficient to establish a good-faith effort to pay the debts.  She\npresented no information to confirm an agreement with a credit counseling agency and payments\nmade to them under an agreement.  Additionally she did not explain why the delinquent debts were\naccumulated so there is no indication the debts resulted from conditions beyond her control.\nApplicant admitted to the debts and took no action to pay or resolve them.  Applicant presented\ninsufficient information to explain the debts, so she has failed to carry her burden.  I conclude\nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns for financial considerations.\n\n6\nI carefully considered all of the circumstances in light of the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept.  I\nconclude Applicant is not eligible for a position of public trust.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as required by Section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a. thru 1.h.:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national security to grant or continue eligibility for assignment to sensitive duties\nfor Applicant.

Finding no error, we\naffirm.\nApplicant elected to have his case decided on the written administrative record, but filed no\nresponse to the government\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM).  His appeal offers a detailed\nexplanation about his alcohol-related conduct, his current efforts at rehabilitation, and his job\nperformance.  Applicant also attaches a copy of his attendance record for his current alcohol\ntreatment program.  However, the Board cannot consider this new evidence on appeal.  See Directive\n\u00b6 E3.1.29.\n  \nIn this case, the Judge made unchallenged findings as follows:  Applicant had consumed\nalcohol, at times in excess and to the point of intoxication, from approximately 1999 to at least 2007.\nIn 2001, Applicant was arrested and charged with Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol (DUI) and\nDriving with a Blood Alcohol Content (BAC) of .08% or more.  He pleaded guilty and was\nsentenced to a one-year suspension of his driver\u2019s license, 240 hours of community service, a fine,\nand three years probation.  In 2004, Applicant was  arrested and charged with DUI and Driving with\na BAC of .08% or more.  He failed to appear, and a Bench Warrant was issued for his arrest.

Nagel, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nMarch 17, 2008\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMOGUL, Martin H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on October 21,\n2004 (Item 4). On October 29, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under\nGuideline G for Applicant (Item 1). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR (RSOR) in writing on November 19, 2007, (Item\n3), and he included additional documents. He also requested that his case be decided\non the written record in lieu of a hearing. \n\n2\nOn January 5, 2007, Department Counsel prepared the Department's written\ncase. A complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) was provided to\nApplicant, and he was given the opportunity to file objections and submit material in\nrefutation, extenuation, or mitigation. A response was due on February 18, 2008.\nApplicant did not submit any additional evidence. The case was assigned to this\nAdministrative Judge on March 4, 2007.\nIn the FORM, Department Counsel offered eight documentary exhibits (Items 1-\n8). No additional documents were offered by Applicant. Based upon a review of the\ncase file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his RSOR (Item 3) Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations under\nGuideline G with explanations for allegations 1.a. and 1.c. The admitted allegations are\nincorporated herein as findings of fact. \nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including the\nFORM, Applicant's RSOR and the other admitted documents, and upon due\nconsideration of that evidence, I make the additional findings of fact: \nApplicant is 27 years old. He works for a defense contractor, and he seeks a\nDoD security clearance in connection with his employment in the defense sector.\n(Guideline J - Alcohol Consumption) \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for\nclearance because he abuses alcohol to excess.  \n1.a. Applicant has consumed alcohol, at times to the point of intoxication, from\napproximately 1999 to at least 2007. In item 3, Applicant admits the allegation, but\nstated that \u201cfrom 2004 to 2007 his alcohol consumption was limited to specific and\nidentified celebrations\u201d such as weddings or other celebrations. \n  \n1.b.  In January 2001, Applicant was arrested and charged with (1) Driving Under\nthe Influence (DUI), and Driving with a Blood Alcohol Content (BAC) of .08% or more.\nApplicant plead guilty and was sentenced to three years probation, a suspended driver\u2019s\nlicense for one year. He was also ordered to serve 240 hours of community service, and\nto pay a fine.\n1.c.  In January 2004, Applicant was arrested and charged with (1) DUI, and\nDriving with a BAC of .08% or more. Applicant failed to appear and in September 2004\na Bench Warrant was issued. Applicant plead guilty on August 20, 2007, and he was\nsentenced to serve 30 days in jail, which was stayed, three years probation. He was\nalso ordered to attend an 18 month Multiple Offender Alcohol Program, and to pay a\nfine.\n\n3\nIn an attachment to Item 3, a November 13, 2007 letter to the judge regarding\nApplicant\u2019s 2004 arrest, discussed in 1.c., below, the manager of a treatment program\nwrote that Applicant \u201cadmits to having a problem with alcohol dating back to his early\n20's, and states there is a history of alcoholism on the fraternal side of the family.\u201d The\nletter follows that if Applicant \u201cfollows our recommended discharge planning we believe\nhe has been given the tools to remains sober and continue in long-term recovery.\u201d  This\nis the only independent evidence offered concerning Applicant\u2019s history of alcohol use\nor his recommendation of future sobriety. Since Applicant did not testify before me, nor\noffer any independent evidence about his current alcohol consumption, I have no\nevidence to conclude that Applicant has complied with the discharge plan of the\nprogram or that his alcohol difficulties have been resolved.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.   \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\n\n4\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline G - Alcohol Consumption\nApplicant's alcohol consumption has resulted in two DUI arrests and convictions,\noccurring in 2001 and 2004.\nThe Government established, by substantial evidence, that Applicant was\ninvolved in alcohol-related incidents away from work, and binge alcohol consumption to\nthe point of impaired judgement. Disqualifying Conditions 22. (a) and (c) apply to this\ncase.  \nAs stated above, in his RSOR (Item 3), Applicant admitted to currently drinking\nat weddings or other celebrations. Since no independent evidence was introduced as to\nthe amount of Applicant\u2019s current alcohol consumption, nor what steps he has taken to\navoid having alcohol related problems in the future, I can not find that any Mitigating\nCondition applies under Guideline G.  Paragraph 1 is found against Applicant.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI have considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions under\nGuideline G, in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Based on\nall of the reasons cited above, including the lack of evidence regarding Applicant\u2019s\n\n5\ncharacter and lifestyle, or any independent evidence on his behalf, I find that the record\nevidence leaves me with serious doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a\nsecurity clearance under the whole person concept. For these reasons, I conclude\nApplicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline G:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst  Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst  Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst  Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \nMartin H. Mogul\nAdministrative Judge\n",

The \nsexual acts procured include sodomy, masturbation and sexual intercourse (Id. at 2).  \nApplicant paid the prostitutes on average about $200-$300 for each session (Id. at 2).  \nHe also paid prostitutes to engage in sexual acts with him in Washington D.C. on \nmultiple occasions (Id. at 3). \n \nIn the last six to eight years, Applicant \u201cengaged in sexual acts [oral sex and \nmasturbation] with men he met at various adult bookstores and adult arcades\u201d in Texas \ntwo or three times per year (Id. at 4-5).8 Applicant noted, \u201c[t]he arcades either have \nlocked private rooms and/or [locked] viewing booths\u201d (Id. at 4). \u201cThere [were] also \noccasions at the arcades when the booths had viewing areas.  People could watch you \nengage[] in sexual activity or masturbating, or [Applicant] could watch them.\u201d (Id. at. 5).  \n \nPrimarily in the early 1990\u2019s and up to about 1999, Applicant masturbated in his \nemployer\u2019s restroom about once a month (Id. at 5). Prior to masturbating in the \nrestroom, he insured no one was in the restroom (Id. at 5). Once or twice in the early \n1990s, he masturbated while in an office at his employer\u2019s place of business, but he \ninsured the door was locked (Id. at. 6). In the 1980\u2019s, he masturbated several times \nwhile driving on an interstate highway (Id. at 6). Other than adult bookstores and \narcades, he did not masturbate in any other public areas (Id. at 6).  \n \nApplicant stated, \u201cI fully understand that much of my actions described above are \ncriminal in nature and a violation of the law\u201d (Id. at 6). He described the sexual contacts \nas impersonal, and not involving feelings of love and/or commitment (Id. at 6).  He was \nnever arrested or charged with violating indecency laws or soliciting prostitution (Id. at \n6).  His payments for sexual acts did not result in financial problems (Id. at 6).  He did \nnot receive therapy or treatment for sexual behavior (Id. at 7).   \n \nApplicant promised in his DSS interview on December 11, 2006 that he would \nmake every effort to refrain from sexual acts outside of marriage and with prostitutes \nwhile holding a security clearance (Id. at 7). However, he admitted that he could not \n\u201cguarantee that [he] would not engage in sexual acts with prostitutes or other persons in \n \n7Item 5 (Applicant\u2019s written statement to a Defense Security Service (DSS) Special Agent, was \nsworn on Dec. 11, 2006) at 1-2. Item 5 is the source for all facts in this section, unless stated otherwise.  \n \n8 In Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S. 558 (2003), the U.S. Supreme Court reversed a Texas Court \ndecision upholding TPC Ann. \u00a7 21.06, which made it a crime for two persons of the same sex to engage \nin certain intimate sexual conduct.  The sexual activity at issue in Lawrence occurred in a private \nresidence between consenting adults, as opposed to sexual activity in a public place.   \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                                          \nthe future\u201d (Id. at 7).  In his response to the SOR he stated, \u201cNow that I know the \nspecific behaviors that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, I will no \nlonger engage in these behaviors while I hold a security clearance\u201d (Item 2 at 1). \n \nAlthough he disclosed the information about the above sexual behavior to U.S. \ngovernment investigators in the past, he has not disclosed such information to his wife, \nchildren, his family, co-workers, supervisors, and neighbors (Id. at 7).  He deliberately \nconcealed the public sexual behavior and sexual behavior with prostitutes from friends \nand family because he knew it would hurt them (Id. at 7).  He said he was embarrassed \nand ashamed of his conduct, but emphasized he would not allow himself to be \nblackmailed or coerced to compromise classified information to avoid disclosure of this \ninformation (Id. at 7).   \n \nApplicant would report any attempts to coerce him to appropriate security officials \n(Id. at 7).  He has never compromised sensitive or classified information (Id. at 8).  \n \nThe majority of the offenses occurred in Texas, and as such violate two criminal \nstatutes: Texas Penal Code (TPC) \u00a7 21.07 prohibiting \u201cpublic lewdness\u201d9 and TPC \u00a7 \n43.02 prohibiting solicitation of sexual acts in return for a fee.10    \n \n9 TPC \u00a7 21.07 provides the elements for the offense of public lewdness stating:  \n \n(a) A person commits an offense if he knowingly engages in any of the following acts in a \npublic place or, if not in a public place, he is reckless about whether another is present \nwho will be offended or alarmed by his: (1) act of sexual intercourse; (2) act of deviate \nsexual intercourse; (3) act of sexual contact; or (4) act involving contact between the \nperson's mouth or genitals and the anus or genitals of an animal or fowl. \n \n(b) An offense under this section is a Class A misdemeanor. \n \nUnder Texas law, an individual peep show booth in an adult bookstore, where a defendant sat beside an \nundercover police officer and began rubbing her genital area, was a public place within the meaning of \nTPC \u00a7 1.07, as the evidence showed it was a part of the \"shop\" open to the public and occupants of the \nbooth had no right to expect privacy.  See Westbrook v. State, 624 S.W.2d 294 (Tex. App. Dallas 1981).  \nMoreover, the interior of a defendant's car was a \"public place\" as defined in TPC \u00a7 1.07 where the car \nwas parked on a public street in a residential area; the windows were not tinted or shaded; and an officer \nwho stood in the public roadway was able to see defendant's companion's genitals. See Edwards v. \nState, 1987 Tex. App. LEXIS 6671 (Tex. App. Houston 14th Dist. Apr. 2, 1987). TPC \u00a7 1.07(a) (40) states,  \n\u201c(40) \u2018Public place\u2019 means any place to which the public or a substantial group of the public has access \nand includes, but is not limited to, streets, highways, and the common areas of schools, hospitals, \napartment houses, office buildings, transport facilities, and shops.).\u201d \n \n10 Under TPC \u00a7 43.02, the criminal offense of prostitution includes the following elements:  \n \n(a) A person commits [prostitution] if he knowingly: \n \n   (1) offers to engage, agrees to engage, or engages in sexual conduct for a fee; or \n   (2) solicits another in a public place to engage with him in sexual conduct for hire. \n \n(b) An offense is established under Subsection (a)(1) whether the actor is to receive or \npay a fee. An offense is established under Subsection (a)(2) whether the actor solicits a \nperson to hire him or offers to hire the person solicited. \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                          \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nIn the decision-making process, the Government has the initial burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d11 \ndemonstrating, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information. \nOnce the Government has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, \nthe burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \n \n \n(c) An offense under this section is a Class B misdemeanor, unless the actor has \npreviously been convicted one or two times of an offense under this section, in which \nevent it is a Class A misdemeanor. If the actor has previously been convicted three or \nmore times of an offense under this section, the offense is a state jail felony. \n \n11 See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable \nmind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cThis is something \nless than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the \nevidence does not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Consolo v. \nFederal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966). \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but \nless than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. \n1994). \n\n \n6 \n \n \n                                                          \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \nGovernment. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).12 \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Subsections 3.1(c) and \n3.1(d) state: \n \n(c) The United States Government does not discriminate on the basis of \n. . .   sexual orientation in granting access to classified information. \n \n(d) In determining eligibility for access under this order, agencies may \ninvestigate and consider any matter that relates to the determination of \nwhether access is clearly consistent with the interests of national security. \nNo inference concerning the standards in this section may be raised solely \non the basis of the sexual orientation of the employee. \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly \nabove, I conclude the following with respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR: \n \n \nGuideline D, Sexual Behavior \n \nAG \u00b6 12 expresses the security concern: \n \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense, indicates a personality or \nemotional disorder, reflects lack of judgment or discretion, or which may \nsubject the individual to undue influence or coercion, exploitation, or \n \n \n12 \u201cThe Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and \nunfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the \nDirective, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006).  \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nduress can raise questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness \nand ability to protect classified information. No adverse inference \nconcerning the standards in this Guideline may be raised solely on the \nbasis of the sexual orientation of the individual. \n \nAG \u00b6 13 describes four conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying: \n \n(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has \nbeen prosecuted; \n \n(b) a pattern of compulsive, self-destructive, or high risk sexual behavior \nthat the person is unable to stop or that may be symptomatic of a \npersonality disorder; \n \n(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and, \n \n(d) sexual behavior of a public nature and/or that reflects lack of discretion \nor judgment. \n \nAG \u00b6 13(b) does not apply because there is no evidence that Applicant is unable \nto stop his public sexual behavior or his sexual behavior involving solicitation of \nprostitutes for sexual activity. AG \u00b6\u00b6 13(a), 13(c) and 13(d) all apply. His sexual \nbehavior is criminal in that it violates Texas Penal Code \u00a7\u00a7 21.07 and 43.02.  Applicant \nis vulnerable to coercion, exploitation or duress because he does not want the \ninformation about his sexual misbehavior with prostitutes and in public to become \nknown to his family, friends, neighbors, co-workers and supervisors. His sexual \nmisbehavior in the adult arcades is of a public nature because others can view it from \noutside the booths. Moreover, his sexual misbehavior reflects a lack of discretion and \njudgment.  \n    \nAG \u00b6 14 provides four conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n \n(a) the behavior occurred prior to or during adolescence and there is no \nevidence of subsequent conduct of a similar nature; \n \n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under \nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and,  \n \n(d) the sexual behavior is strictly private, consensual, and discreet. \n\n \n8 \n \n \n  \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 14(a), 14(c) and 14(d) do not apply.  The sexual behavior involving \nprostitutes occurred between 1977 and October 2006, and Applicant is now 58 years \nold. His sexual misconduct continued well past his adolescence, and is not a youthful \nindiscretion. The sexual behavior in the adult arcades is not \u201cstrictly private.\u201d  Because \nof his embarrassment and fears that information about his sexual behavior will hurt his \nfamily and friends, he is subject to coercion, exploitation, or duress. \n \nAG \u00b6 14(b) partially applies. Security concerns can be mitigated based on AG \u00b6 \n14(b) by showing that the sexual behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur, and does not cast doubt \non his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. There are no \u201cbright line\u201d \nrules for determining when conduct is \u201crecent.\u201d The determination must be based \u201con a \ncareful evaluation of the totality of the record within the parameters set by the directive.\u201d  \nISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). If the evidence shows a \nsignificant period of time has passed without any evidence of misconduct, then an \nadministrative judge must determine whether that period of time demonstrates changed \ncircumstances or conduct sufficient to warrant a finding of reform or rehabilitation. \n \nAG \u00b6 14(b) does not fully apply because Applicant\u2019s most recent sexual behavior \nwith prostitutes occurred in October 2006, and his sexual acts at adult bookstores and \narcades occurred within the last several years. However, his incidents of masturbation \nin a car occurred in the 1980s, and this particular misconduct is mitigated by the \npassage of time. The masturbation in the car was not repeated after the 1980s. There is \nnot enough information about the incidents involving masturbation in the car to be \nconfident that the conduct was public. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such \nas (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing . . .; and, \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \n(f) violation of a written or recorded commitment made by the individual to \nthe employer as a condition of employment. \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 16(e)(1) and 16(f) apply. The 2002 security letter warned Applicant that \nhis conduct with prostitutes could result in the loss of his security clearance.  He \nacknowledged he understood the restrictions against sexual activity with prostitutes, \nand yet he subsequently violated that written directive. Certainly disclosure of \nApplicant\u2019s sexual misconduct with prostitutes and public sexual activity in adult arcades \nand bookstores would negatively affect his personal, professional, or community \nstanding, \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides seven conditions that could mitigate security concerns in this \ncase: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully. \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and, \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or \noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules \nand regulations. \n  \n\n \n10 \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17(c) applies with respect to the masturbation in his car in the early 1980\u2019s \nfor the reasons stated in the previous section.  However, this mitigation will not be \nreflected in the Formal Findings section because all Personal Conduct concerns are \nconsolidated in SOR \u00b6 2.a.  \n \nNone of the other mitigating conditions in AG \u00b6 17 apply. Applicant\u2019s conduct did \nnot involve falsification of any documents, or attempts to obstruct or mislead a security \ninvestigation. He did not receive counseling designed to change his sexual conduct, and \nhe did not describe other positive steps to change his sexual misbehavior. Applicant \nadmitted the sexual behavior at issue, and the sexual behavior alleged in the SOR is  \nsubstantiated. He was associating with people engaged in prostitution and public sexual \nacts as recently as October 2006. His equivocal promise not to engage in future, similar \nsexual misbehavior, while holding a security clearance, does not convince me that \nsimilar misbehavior is unlikely to recur. The sexual misbehavior at issue casts doubt on \nhis reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment because he was unable to conform his \nsexual behavior to criminal laws in Texas, especially after being warned of the \nconsequences of engaging in sexual activity with prostitutes in the 2002 security letter.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.     \nApplicant voluntarily and candidly disclosed his criminal sexual misbehavior to \nsecurity officials. He provided the only record evidence showing his sexual misconduct. \nHis promise to refrain from illegal sexual behavior in the future weighs in his favor. \nSome of the sexual conduct, specifically the incidents of masturbation in a car in the \n1980s occurred so long ago that they have little probative value. He provided evidence \nof remorse, or regret concerning his sexual misconduct. He was embarrassed by his \nmisconduct, he showed some remorse, and he recognized the damage his sexual \nmisconduct might cause to his family and his reputation. His record of good employment \nweighs in his favor. These factors show some responsibility, rehabilitation, and \nmitigation. \n \n\n \n11 \n \n \n                                                          \n  \nThe evidence against mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct is more substantial. His  \nsexual behavior involving prostitutes, and public sexual acts was knowledgeable and \nvoluntary. His sexual misconduct occurred over more than 25 years, and he was about \n56 years old when he last violated Texas laws concerning indecent sexual behavior and \nsolicitation of prostitution. He was sufficiently mature to be fully responsible for his \nconduct. Criminal sexual misbehavior is not prudent or responsible. His criminal sexual \nbehavior, while holding a security clearance, and after being warned in the 2002 \nsecurity letter to stop this sexual misconduct or potentially lose his clearance, is \nparticularly aggravating, and weighs heavily against granting or continuing his security \nclearance. He did not receive counseling or therapy, and may not have a clear \nunderstanding about how to avoid problematic situations and why he engaged in the \nsexual misconduct. \n \n  \nI have persistent and serious doubts about his judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. His criminal sexual misconduct calls into question his current ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. After weighing the disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions, and all the facts and circumstances, in the context of the \nwhole person, I conclude he has not mitigated the security concerns pertaining to \nsexual behavior and personal conduct.    \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d13 and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas not mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I \nconclude he is not eligible for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline D:    \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.c: \n Against Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.e to 1.f:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:    \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n13See ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd. June 28, 2006).  \n\n \n12 \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security \nclearance for Applicant.

Blank, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nMark S. Zaid, Esq.\n\n2\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On May 29, 2007, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline E (Personal Conduct), Guideline\nM (Misuse of Information Technology Systems), and Guideline D (Sexual Behavior) of Department\nof Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.\nOn December 28, 2007, after the hearing, Administrative Judge John Grattan Metz, Jr., denied\nApplicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant filed a timely appeal pursuant to Directive\n\u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in denying\nApplicant\u2019s motion to amend the SOR; whether the Judge erred in concluding that Applicant had\nnot mitigated the security concerns alleged in the SOR; and whether the Judge erred in his whole-\nperson analysis.  We also construe Applicant\u2019s appeal as alleging that the Judge was biased against\nApplicant.  Finding no harmful error, we affirm.\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant is a senior engineer\nemployed by a Defense contractor.  A graduate of a U.S. military academy, he served over 25 years\nas an officer, retiring as an 0-5.\nApplicant has been addicted to pornography since about 1959.  From 1960 to 2002 he\nmasturbated in public places, such as his automobile, his locked office, locked bathroom stalls at\nwork or in gas stations, hotel rooms, etc, after viewing pornography.  From 1969 until 1978 he used\nthe services of prostitutes, anywhere from 30 to 50 times.  Additionally, be had extramarital affairs\nbefore and after his separation from his first wife.  He has had none since his remarriage some three\ndecades ago.  \nFrom 1977 until 2002 Applicant took time from work to visit adult bookstores and movies.\nHe used his vacation time in doing so.  From 1998 until January 2003, and again in June 2004, he\nused government or company-provided computers to view pornography.  At the time of this use,\nApplicant was aware of his employers\u2019 policies against such activity.   \nIn 1998 Applicant received a \u201ccode of conduct\u201d letter from his employer, another government\nagency, for having viewed pornographic material on a government computer, while holding a\nsecurity clearance.  Despite this corrective action, Applicant continued to engage such conduct.  In\n2003, the government agency revoked his access to special compartmented information (SCI).  In\nJune 2004 Applicant again accessed pornography on a government computer, although he claimed\nthat he did so by accident.  Applicant\u2019s employer gave him a warning letter.\nIn 2000 Applicant sought counseling, although there was no discussion during these sessions\nof his pornography addiction.  This counseling ended in 2001 by mutual agreement with the\ncounselor.  In addition, Applicant began attending Sexaholics Anonymous (SA) and continues to do\nso, although the Judge noted that the record is not clear as to how consistent his attendance has been\nover the years.

The decision quotes the counselor as stating that Applicant was serious about being\nabstinent and predicting ultimate success for Applicant in this regard.\nIn August 2006 Applicant again sought professional counseling from a certified sexual\naddiction therapist.  She required patients to meet with her individually, attend 12-step meetings,\nobtain a sponsor, and begin the 12 steps.  She stated that Applicant performed better in treatment\nthan is typical, because he acknowledged his problem.  By March 2007 she decided that he no longer\nneeded individual sessions with her and that he is at a low risk of relapse as long as he attends SA,\nworks with his sponsor, and works his 12-step program.  \nApplicant last viewed pornographic material in September 2007, 16 days prior to the hearing\nin his case.  He did so for between 30 and 90 minutes.  He has visited pornographic web sites about\n20 times since his last visit with his therapist in March 2007.  He stated that he no longer masturbates\nin public places and has not taken time off form work to view pornography since 2002.  Although\nhe no longer has a sponsor, he attends SA meetings weekly and is working on several of the 12 steps.\nApplicant\u2019s current employer is aware of his history with viewing pornography on\ngovernment computers.   His employer has placed software on his work computer to monitor his\ninternet usage.  According to these witnesses, Applicant has not been discovered viewing\npornography at work since 2004, although the system is checked infrequently.  \nApplicant has alleged that the Judge erred in not amending the SOR pursuant to a motion at\nthe beginning of the hearing.   Applicant, in this motion, contended that certain of the Guideline D\nallegations did not state security concerns.  He further contended that certain of the Guideline M\nallegations merely repeated the same concern over and over again, thereby creating the impression\nof a greater quantum of misconduct than was actually the case.   Applicant had not previously\n1\nnotified Department Counsel of his proposed motion.  The Judge denied the motion on the grounds\nthat it was untimely and that Applicant had already admitted the allegations in the statement of\nreasons.  Tr. at 20.    \nIt is clear that \u201c[t]he SOR may be amended at the hearing . . .  upon motion by . . . the\napplicant, so as to render it in conformity with the evidence admitted or for other good cause.  When\nsuch amendments are made, the Administrative Judge may grant either party\u2019s request for such\nadditional time as the Administrative Judge may deem appropriate for further preparation or other\ngood cause.\u201d  Directive E3.1.17.  A Judge\u2019s ruling on a motion to amend is reviewed for abuse of\ndiscretion.  ISCR Case No. 04-08547 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 30, 2007).  \n\nIn his argument in support of the motion, and subsequently upon appeal, Applicant\u2019s counsel appeared to raise\n2\nquestions about the sufficiency of the evidence. At the time of the motion, however, no evidence had been received or\nadmitted.  Sufficiency of the evidence is a matter properly raised only after the evidence has been admitted.  \nDirective \u00b6 E2.12.  \u201cSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense, indicates a personality or emotional\n3\ndisorder, reflects lack of judgment or discretion, or which may subject the individual to undue influence or coercion,\nexploitation, or duress can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation.\u201d  Applicant argues, inter alia, that conduct such as viewing lawful pornography cannot constitute a security\nconcern under Guideline D.  The Board finds no support for this contention.  Even conduct that is not illegal may, under\nthe facts of a particular case, reflect an emotional disorder or deficiency in  judgement or discretion.  \nSee Directive \u00b6 E3.1.3.  See also ISCR Case No. 02-15383 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jul. 29, 2003.)  \u201cAn SOR is an\n4\nadministrative pleading that is not measured against the strict requirements of a criminal indictment.  As long as an SOR\nplaces an applicant on reasonable notice of the allegations against him or her and there has been no showing that the\nwording of an SOR has prejudiced an applicant\u2019s ability to respond to the allegations and present evidence on his or her\nbehalf, a security clearance case should be adjudicated on the merits of the relevant issues and not be concerned with\npleading niceties.\u201d \n4\nInsofar as the Judge denied the motion as untimely, he committed error.  As the Directive\nstates, a motion to amend can be made at the hearing.   There is no provision in the Directive which\nwould forbid a motion to amend under the circumstances reflected in the record of this case, based\nupon its timing.  A review of the transcript demonstrates that the motion was made in apparent good\nfaith and not for the purpose of needless delay or to produce confusion.  The Judge should have\ninquired as to whether Department Counsel needed a continuance to prepare to address the motion,\nand then he should have proceeded in accordance with the Directive.  \nAlthough Department Counsel did not concede this error in his reply to Applicant\u2019s brief,\nnevertheless he further argued that the Judge\u2019s ruling can be supported upon alternative grounds,\nspecifically that a fair reading of the SOR demonstrates that Applicant\u2019s motion was without merit.\nDepartment Counsel\u2019s argument on this point is persuasive.  In examining this issue, the Board will\nlimit its attention to whether the allegations on their face state security concerns, without regard to\nthe sufficiency of the evidence underlying them.   \n2\nRegarding Guideline D, Applicant argued that certain of the allegations are not, on their face,\nrationally related to the sexual behavior security concerns.  After reviewing the language of the\nconcern section  the Board disagrees with Applicant\u2019s argument.  The Board has examined these\n3\nallegations and concludes that, viewed as a whole, they constitute prima facie statements of sexual\nbehavior security concerns contemplated by the Directive.  Furthermore, the Guideline M allegations\nwould not mislead a reasonable person as to the nature and extent of Applicant\u2019s misuse of\ninformation technology systems.  Taken as a whole, the SOR satisfies the requirement of the\nDirective that Applicant be provided with \u201cdetailed and comprehensive\u201d notice of DOHA\u2019s basis\nfor the proposed denial of a clearance, facilitating rather than impeding Applicant\u2019s ability to respond\nto the allegations and to present his case.   The Board has considered Applicant\u2019s reply to the SOR,\n4\nin which he admitted the facts alleged but provided explanatory comments in an effort to mitigate\ntheir effect.  These comments, prepared with the assistance of counsel, do not demonstrate or imply\nthe legal infirmities which are claimed in Applicant\u2019s motion, leading to the conclusion that he has\n\nSee, e. g., Government Exhibit 5, Statement of Applicant, dated January 29, 2007, at 5.  \u201cI am confident in\n5\nstating that I do not have any future intentions of viewing sexually explicit or objectionable material while using my\ncompany or government owned computer; however, I cannot state that [I] will never do it again in the future.\u201d  \n5\nnot been impaired in his efforts to present his side of the story or otherwise receive the due process\nafforded by the Directive.  Therefore, we conclude that the Judge\u2019s erroneous reason for his ruling\non Applicant\u2019s motion is harmless error, in that it is unlikely that he would have decided the issue\ndifferently had he ruled on the substance of the motion rather than its timing.      \nTo the extent that Applicant\u2019s brief raises a claim of bias, Applicant has failed to meet his\nburden of demonstrating that the Judge lacked the requisite impartiality.  See ISCR Case No. 07-\n02253 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 28, 2008).  Furthermore, a review of the entire record demonstrates that\nthe Judge has articulated \u201ca rational connection between the facts found\u201d and his adverse clearance\ndecision, both as to the pertinent mitigating conditions and the whole-person analysis.    Motor\n5\nVehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43\n(1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  Even if\nthe Judge erred in concluding that Applicant had not mitigated the two Guideline D allegations\npertaining to his SA attendance and to his counseling with the sex addiction therapist, the record is\nsufficient to sustain his holding that Applicant has failed to meet his burden of persuasion as to the\nremaining allegations.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  (After the government presents evidence raising\nsecurity concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to establish any appropriate mitigating\nconditions.)   See also Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). (\u201cThe general\nstandard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the\nnational security.\u2019\u201d)  Accordingly, the Judge\u2019s adverse decision is neither arbitrary, capricious, nor\ncontrary to law.  \nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance decision is AFFIRMED. \nSigned: Michael Y.

Applicant\n1\nanswered the SOR 19 July 2007 and requested a hearing. DOHA assigned the case to me 29 August\n2007, and I convened a hearing 9 October 2007. DOHA received the transcript 17 October 2007.\nPROCEDURAL ISSUES\nAt hearing, I denied Applicant\u2019s motion to amend the SOR, which was for all practical\npurposes a motion for summary judgment (Tr. 10-20).\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted the allegations of the SOR. Accordingly, I incorporate his admissions as\nfindings of fact. He is a 62-year-old senior engineer employed by a defense contractor since fall\n2003. He seeks to retain the clearances he has held in the military and industry since approximately\n1968. He also seeks reinstatement of his eligibility for access to special compartmented information\n(SCI). His access to SCI was revoked by another government agency in September 2003 because of\nhis problems with accessing pornographic websites on government and company computers. He is\na 1967 graduate of a U.S. military academy, and served over 25 years on active duty, reaching\npaygrade O-5.\nApplicant has been a self-described, and now-diagnosed, pornography addict since about\n1959, when he was age 14. His addiction has manifested itself in a variety of ways over nearly 50\nyears, and has evolved with the technology of pornography. From 1960 to 2002, he masturbated in\npublic places\u2014 ranging from his automobile, to his locked office, to locked bathroom stalls at work\nor in gas stations, to hotel rooms while on temporary duty\u2014after viewing pornography. From 1969\nto 1978, he used the services of prostitutes 30-50 times. Between 1970 and 1977, he had extramarital\naffairs before and after his 1973 separation from his first wife, but none since his 1977 divorce and\n1978 remarriage.\nFrom 1977 to 2002, Applicant took time off from work to go to adult bookstores and movies,\nalthough he always used vacation time to make up the time lost from work. From June 1998 to\nJanuary 2003, and again in June 2004, he used his government/company-provided laptop and\ndesktop computers to view pornography for several minutes to several hours at a time, despite\nknowing that both government and company policies prohibited such use.\nIn August 1998, he received a code of conduct letter from another government agency\nconcerning his misuse of government computers in viewing pornographic material, while holding\na TS/SCI clearance. Yet, he continued to do it because he could not control his urges. When his\nclearances and access came up for periodic reinvestigation in 2001, Applicant disclosed this\ncontinued misuse of government/ company computers, and his SCI access was revoked in September\n2003. Although Applicant claims that the June 2004 incident was caused by his mistakenly using\n\n3\nhis company laptop, rather than his personal laptop, to view pornography, the company nevertheless\nissued him a warning letter (A.E. B) promising stern disciplinary action if the problem recurred.\nApplicant has tried on his own, and with professional help, to deal with his addiction, without\ncomplete success. In September 2000, he sought counseling with a licensed professional counselor\nwho had given a presentation at Applicant\u2019s church. Applicant saw the counselor about 20 times,\ninitially weekly, but tapering off to every other month. The counselor stated that the sessions\ninvolved only counseling, not diagnosis or prognosis. Applicant sought \u201cassistance in dealing with\nhaving a wife and eight children. He wanted to be proactive and maintain control in all aspects of\nhis personal life.\u201d There was no discussion of Applicant\u2019s pornography addiction. The counseling\nended in May 2001 by mutual agreement (G.E. 4).\nIn addition, Applicant began attending Sexaholics Anonymous (SA) in 2001, and continues\nattending, although the record is not clear on how consistent he has been in his attendance over time.\nSA is one of a number of programs dealing with various forms of addiction that have adopted the\nAlcoholics Anonymous (AA) model for recovery from those addictions, including 12-step programs,\nsponsorship, and different kinds of support meetings.\nIn October 2003, Applicant sought additional counseling for his addiction, and elicited a\nreport back to his employer in February 2004 (A.E. A):\n [Applicant] contacted me for his first appointment on October 3,\n2003. He was referred to me because of my specialty in working with\naddictions. I have never worked with anyone more serious in\nmanaging their goal of abstinence. He fully understands the\nnegative consequences of continuing in his addiction. He has an\nexcellent plan for abstinence which includes the support of a 12\nstep group and regular counseling with me. . . I have high\nconfidence that he will be successful with his goal of total abstinence\n[my emphasis].\nUnfortunately, the record contains no further evidence of the extent of the counseling, or\nprogress made by Applicant. However, the record is clear that Applicant was not successful in\nreaching his goal of abstinence.\nIn August 2006, Applicant again sought professional counseling, this time with a certified\nsexual addiction therapist. At the time, he had not been to an SA meeting in six months. Like the\ncounselor in 2003, she also endorses the SA/AA model for treatment and recovery. However, she\ndoes not think it necessary to obtain prior treatment records, and did not do so in this case because\nshe believed what Applicant was telling her. She requires her patients to meet with her individually,\nattend 12-step meetings, obtain a sponsor, and begin to work the 12 steps. She subscribes to the\ndisease-concept of addiction, and consequently espouses total abstinence for her clients.\nThe therapist found that Applicant performed far better than her typical client, because he\ncame to her program not in denial that he had a problem. Typically, overcoming a client\u2019s denial of\na problem is the first, and greatest, barrier to recovery. By March 2007, she concluded that Applicant\nno longer required individual sessions, and they ceased by mutual agreement. She was aware at the\n\n4\ntime that Applicant had experienced what she characterized as \u201cslips\u201d\u2014which she analogized to an\nalcoholic taking a drink one day, but going back to the program of abstinence the next. She\ndistinguished a \u201cslip\u201d from a \u201crelapse,\u201d which she described as leaving the program, stopping\nattending meetings, telling their therapist they are done with treatment. She opined that a patient\nmight go through several relapses before seeking new treatment. However, she gave inconsistent\ndescriptions of what constituted \u201clong term sobriety,\u201d variously stating 6-7 months (Tr. 71) then\nthree months (Tr. 72), which she used as part of her basis for concluding that Applicant no longer\nrequired individual therapy. She considered Applicant to be at low risk of relapse as long as he\ncontinued to attend SA, continued to work with his sponsor, and continued to work his step program.\nAt hearing, Applicant described his current situation. He last viewed pornographic websites\non his home computer in September 2007, 16 days before the hearing, for between 30 and 90\nminutes. He estimates that he has visited pornographic websites about 20 times since he last saw his\ntherapist in March 2007, typically for 30 to 90 minutes. He states that these viewings come in spurts,\nwhere he goes for some period of time without viewing, then viewing for several consecutive days.\nIn this fashion, he might go two months without viewing pornography, and three months without\nmasturbating in response to the viewing. Stress at work and at home are the usual triggers for his\nactivity. He states that he no longer masturbates in public places, and last took time from work to\ngo view pornography in 2002. Six months is the longest he has ever gone without viewing\npornography. He knows his pornography viewing is absolutely inconsistent with his religious beliefs,\nand contributes to stress in his relationship with his wife.\nApplicant no longer has a sponsor in SA, but meets regularly with a four-person book study\ngroup, that he feels fulfills the same purpose. He goes to SA meetings weekly, and is doing step work\nwith steps 4, 5, and 6. He intends to continue going to SA. He states that his wife, his six oldest\nchildren, and a smattering of neighborhood, church, and work friends are aware of his addiction. He\nthinks his wife is aware of his continued viewing of pornography. Only his two youngest children,\nages 14 and 9, are unaware of his issues.\nApplicant\u2019s character references (A.E. A), only some of whom are familiar with his\npornography addiction, consider him honest and trustworthy, and suitable for access to classified\ninformation. The chief operating officer (COO), president and chief executive officer (CEO), and\nfacility security officer (FSO) all testified to Applicant\u2019s honesty and trustworthiness. Each is aware\nof Applicant\u2019s addiction to pornography, as well as the monitoring software the company had placed\non Applicant\u2019s computer at work. The COO testified that the Applicant received a warning in June\n2004, when the software detected Applicant accessing a pornographic website, but acknowledged\nthat the monitoring system is not checked regularly. He checked it before the hearing and stated that\nApplicant had not accessed pornographic websites since 2004. However, the FSO confirmed that the\nmonitoring system is checked infrequently. The CEO testified that Applicant would be fired if he\naccesses pornographic websites with his computer, a fact known to Applicant. The COO, CEO, and\nFSO are aware that Applicant continues to view pornography on his personal computer at home.\nPOLICIES AND BURDEN OF PROOF\nThe Revised Adjudicative Guidelines contain factors to be considered in evaluating an\nApplicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information. Administrative Judges must assess both\n\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n2\n\u00b6 40.(a) illegal or unauthorized entry into any information technology system or component thereof; (e)\n3\nunauthorized use of a government or other information technology system;\n\u00b6 41.(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior happened, or it happened under such unusual\n4\ncircumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment;\n5\ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative issue fairly raised by the facts and\ncircumstances presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense\nconsideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3. of the Directive. The presence or absence of a\ndisqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or against Applicant. However, specific\nadjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them, as they\nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified information.\nConsidering the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative\nguidelines are  Guideline E (Personal Conduct), Guideline M (Misuse of Information Technology\nSystems) and Guideline D (Sexual Behavior) .\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant or continue an Applicant\u2019s security clearance. The government must prove, by something\nless than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it\nestablishes a prima facie case against access to classified information. Applicant must then refute,\nextenuate, or mitigate the government\u2019s case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the\nApplicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship with the\ngovernment based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a compelling interest in\nensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness of those\nwho must protect national interests as their own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d\nstandard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in\nfavor of the government.2\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe government failed to establish a Guideline E case. All  aspects of Applicant\u2019s conduct\nare completely addressed by the adjudicative criteria for misuse of information technology systems,\nand that misuse did not occur under any circumstances implicating the more substantive criteria\nunder personal conduct. I resolve Guideline E for Applicant.\nThe government established a case for disqualification under Guideline M, by demonstrating\nApplicant\u2019s extensive use of government/company computers to access pornography sites.  His use\n3\nwas deliberate and in knowing violation of government and company policies. None of the\nmitigating conditions apply. The misuse was recent, not under unusual circumstances, and casts\nconsiderable doubt on Applicant\u2019s good judgment.  It was not minor or aimed at any organizational\n4\n\n\u00b6 41.(b) the misuse was minor and done only in the interest of organizational efficiency and effectiveness,\n5\nsuch as letting another person use one\u2019s password or computer when no other alternative was readily available;\n\u00b6 41.(c) the conduct was unintentional or inadvertent and was followed by a prompt, good-faith effort to\n6\ncorrect the situation and by notification of supervisor.\n\u00b6 13.(b) a pattern of compulsive, self-destructive, or high risk sexual behavior that the person is unable to\n7\nstop or that may be symptomatic of a personality disorder;\nE \u00b6 13.(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or duress;\n8\n\u00b6 13.(d) sexual behavior of a public nature and/or that which reflects lack of discretion or judgment.\n9\n\u00b6 14.(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under such unusual circumstances,\n10\nthat it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment;\n6\nbenefit.  The misuse was neither unintentional, inadvertent, nor followed by corrective actions and\n5\ndisclosure.   Further, given Applicant\u2019s pornography addiction as noted below, I cannot reasonably\n6\nconclude that the misuse is not likely to recur, Applicant\u2019s promises notwithstanding. I conclude\nGuideline M against Applicant.\nThe government established a case for disqualification under Guideline D, by demonstrating\nnumerous and varied manifestations of Applicant\u2019s pornography addiction,  that leave him\n7\npotentially subject to duress,  including numerous incidents occurring at work and other public\n8\nplaces.9\nBoth Applicant and his therapist stressed the parallels between alcohol addiction and\nApplicant\u2019s pornography addiction. The analogy is apt, but does not lead to the conclusion Applicant\ndesires. He argues that now that he no longer uses government/company computers, his pornography\nviewing is no different than having a drink. Both activities are legal. However, Applicant\u2019s argument\nignores his addiction. He is like the alcoholic who thinks he can continue to drink, without falling\ninto abusive patterns of drinking. Applicant\u2019s continued pornography has moved beyond the \u201cslips\u201d\ndiscussed by his therapist. And perhaps Applicant has not moved into relapse as discussed by his\ntherapist because he continues to go to SA and work his step program. However, his substituting a\nbook study group for a program sponsor is not something his therapist is aware of, or opined on.\nFurther, his description of his pornography viewing after he last met with his therapist might fairly\nbe described as \u201cbinging\u201d\u2014several days off the wagon of abstinence before returning to sobriety for\na time. Additionally, Applicant was apparently down this road in late 2003-early 2004, with an\nabsolute commitment to abstinence, a vigorous 12-step program, and regular individual therapy, to\nno avail. What is clear is continued regular pornography viewing by a compulsive viewer. While it\nmay be that his pornography viewing will not get any worse, it is equally likely, given his history,\nthat it will. The worse it gets, the worse his relationship with his wife is likely to get and the greater\nthe likelihood that the time will come when he is unable to refrain from using government/computers\nto view pornography.\nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns raised by his sexual behavior. The conduct\nis recent, indeed ongoing.  Applicant was not an adolescent at the time of the conduct, which has\n10\n\n\u00b6 14.(a) the behavior during or prior to adolescence and there is no evidence of subsequent conduct of a\n11\nsimilar nature.\n\u00b6 14.(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or duress.\n12\n7\ncontinued nearly 50 years to within weeks of the hearing.  The fact that many of his friends,\n11\nneighbors, and co-workers are aware of his addiction, and his struggles with treatment somewhat\nmitigates the potential for duress. But the disclosure offers little assurance that Applicant would be\nas forthcoming in the future should his addiction get worse instead of better.

He discharged his debts in a\n\nItem 3 (Applicant\u2019s letter response to SOR dated Feb. 22, 2007).\n1\nThe government submitted eight items in support of the allegations.\n2\nSee Item 3. Although he denied that the statements in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c and 1.d were accurate as of the date\n3\nof his response, he admitted that he had owed each listed debt and said he had made payments, during February 2007,\ntoward these debts as further specified below. \n2\n2001 Chapter 7 bankruptcy, and subsequently incurred significant delinquent debt. He paid the two\nsmallest delinquent debts after receiving notice that his clearance may be denied, but did not meet\nhis burden of mitigating security concerns raised by his history of, and ongoing, financial\nirresponsibility. Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nApplicant applied for a security clearance on August 19, 2005, in conjunction with his\nemployment by a defense contractor. On January 30, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, pursuant to Executive Order\n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended,\nand Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance\nReview Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended. The SOR detailed reasons, under\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations), why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative\nfinding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant a security\nclearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether\na clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.\nApplicant responded to the SOR allegations in a notarized letter dated February 22, 2007,\nadmitting the truth of all of the allegations at the time the SOR was issued but denying that he still\nowed some of the debts, and elected to have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a\nhearing. Applicant included settlement payment receipts for two of the five debts listed in the SOR,\nand a letter from a third creditor documenting a repayment plan.  He did not submit any other matters\n1\nfor consideration in extenuation or mitigation of his admissions. Department Counsel submitted the\ngovernment's written case on March 16, 2007. A complete copy of the file of relevant material\n(FORM)  was provided to Applicant, and he was afforded an opportunity to file objections and\n2\nsubmit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant signed the document\nacknowledging receipt of his copy of the FORM on March 26, 2007, and returned it to DOHA. He\ndid not submit any further response to the FORM by the April 25, 2007 due date, nor did he request\nan extension of time to respond. The case was assigned to me on May 24, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted the truth of the factual allegations set forth in the SOR pertaining to\nfinancial considerations under Guideline B (subparagraphs 1.a through 1.f).  Those admissions are\n3\n\nItem 4 (e-QIP security clearance questionnaire, dated Aug. 19, 2005) at 8, 13-14.

After complete and thorough review of the evidence in the\nrecord, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 47-year-old employee of a defense contractor seeking to obtain a security\nclearance.  He served on active duty in the Army Reserve from 1978 until 1995 and held a secret\n4\nclearance.  He is married, for the third time, and has two children, ages 11 and 3, who reside with\n5\nhim.  He owns a home with a 40-year mortgage obtained in July 2006. The mortgage loan balance\n6\nis about $584,000 with a monthly payment of $4,849. This mortgage appears to be a refinancing,\nsince he reported living in this home from May 2004 to present.  He and his wife have a net monthly\nincome of $8,820.  \n7\nAfter leaving the Army, Applicant worked as a letter carrier for the Postal Service from 1995\nuntil 2005.  Despite his ongoing and steady employment, Applicant filed for Chapter 7 (dissolution)\n8\nbankruptcy on December 13, 2000, and the final order discharging his debts to nine creditors was\nentered on August 23, 2001.  He reported never having been fired from, or leaving a job under\n9\nunfavorable circumstances,  and since he provided no information indicating he was forced to\n10\nresign, I conclude that he voluntarily left his job with the post office. \nFor four months (February to June 2005 \u2013 between his postal job and his current\nemployment), Applicant was self-employed as a cook, doing business as \u201cRudy\u2019s Ribs.\u201d In his\nresponse to the SOR, Applicant said \u201cI . . . had financial difficulty due to a failed business attempt\nbut I have paid or currently [sic] in the process of paying all of my debts.\u201d He provided no other\ninformation concerning this business or how his debts relate to it.\nThe first delinquent debt, alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a, was to a satellite television company, placed\nfor collection, in the amount of $180. It became delinquent in May 2005.  Applicant made a $90.09\n11\npayment to the collection agency on February 7, 2007 in full settlement of this debt.12\nThe second delinquent debt, alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b, was to a bank in the amount of $685 for\n\nItem 6 at 1; Item 8 at 2.\n13\nItem 3 at 1, 5.\n14\nItem 6 at 2; Item 8 at 2.\n15\nItem 3 at 1, 4.\n16\nItem 6 at 3; Item 8 at 3.\n17\nFORM at 5, 10.\n18\nItem 6 at 3; Item 8 at 3. Of note, the CBRs show this account as charged off with a zero balance due.\n19\nApplicant provided no further information about this debt, except to admit that he is currently indebted to this credit\nunion.\nSee Item 6 at 2, 3; Item 7 at 8; Item 8 at 3.\n20\n4\ncredit card debt. It became delinquent in April 2005.  Applicant settled this debt in full, with\n13\nagreement of the creditor, by making a $460 payment on February 22, 2007.14\nSOR \u00b6 1.c alleged delinquent credit card debt to a collection agency in the amount of $1,171.\nThis debt, which was $1,435 in October 2006, became delinquent in August 2004.  In December\n15\n2006, Applicant agreed to pay  $292, and monthly payments of $198.  As of February 13, 2007, he\nowed $977.86 on this debt.16\nSOR \u00b6 1.d alleged a $1,732 debt to a lease financing company for an account that was opened\nin December 2003 and became delinquent in September 2005.  Applicant stated in his response to\n17\nthe SOR that he made a $1,082 settlement-in-full payment to this company on February 22, 2007,\nand was awaiting receipt of a confirmation letter. He also included a name and telephone number\nof a company employee to contact for verification. Despite Department Counsel\u2019s comments on this\nabsence of documentation in the FORM discussion and argument,  Applicant did not submit a copy\n18\nof this confirmation letter, or anything else, in response to the FORM.\nSOR \u00b6 1.e alleged a charged off bad debt for a $13,797 auto loan from a credit union. This\naccount was opened in June 2004, and became delinquent in February 2005.  Applicant admitted\n19\nhe owed an unspecified amount on this account, and said that on February 22, 2007 he had arranged\nwith the credit union to pay $140 per month toward it. The original monthly payment on this loan\nwas $497, and with no further interest or penalties it would take more than 8 years to pay it off at the\narranged monthly rate.   \nThe three CBRs at Items 6, 7 and 8 of the FORM report that several other debts, that were\nincurred after Applicant\u2019s August 2001 Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge, are currently \u201cinvolved in\nChapter 13 debt adj,\u201d \u201cincluded in Chapter 13,\u201d or \u201cwage earner plan account (Chapter 13).\u201d  None\n20\nof these debts are alleged in the SOR, or otherwise addressed by Department Counsel in the FORM.\nPOLICIES            \nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be considered in\n\nDirective, Enclosure 2, Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified\n21\nInformation, dated August 2006, at \u00b6 2.\nId. at \u00b6 2(a).\n22\nId. at \u00b6\u00b6 2(b), 2(c).\n23\n\u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might  accept as adequate to support\n24\na conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006)\n(citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1).  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing\ntwo inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial\nevidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966).  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a\nscintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4  Cir. 1994).\nth\n5\nthe evaluation of security suitability. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline,\nthe adjudicative guidelines are divided into disqualifying conditions (DC) that may raise security\nconcerns, and mitigating conditions (MC) that may reduce or negate security concerns. Applicable\nDCs and MCs under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) must be considered in deciding whether\nto grant, continue, deny or revoke Applicant's eligibility for access to classified information.\nAn administrative judge need not view the adjudicative guidelines as inflexible, ironclad\nrules of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are\nintended to be applied in conjunction with the factors set forth in the Adjudicative Process provision\nof the Directive,  to assist the administrative judge in reaching fair and impartial, common sense\n21\ndecisions.\nThe entire decision-making process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables\nknown as the \"whole person concept.\" All available, reliable information about the person, past and\npresent, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in making a meaningful decision. The\nAdjudicative Process factors which an administrative judge should consider, in addition to the\napplicable guidelines, are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency\nand recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the\nextent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.22\nProtection of the national security is the paramount consideration, so the final decision in\neach case must be arrived at by applying the standard that issuance of a clearance must be clearly\nconsistent with the interests of national security. Any doubt as to whether access to classified\ninformation is clearly consistent with national security must be resolved in favor of the national\nsecurity.   In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical\n23\nand based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d  The\n24\nburden of producing evidence initially falls on the government to establish a case which\ndemonstrates, in accordance with the Directive, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant or continue an applicant's access to classified information. \u201cDepartment Counsel is\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that\n\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n25\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n26\nISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005); ?The Administrative Judge [considers] the record\n27\nevidence as a whole, both favorable and unfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of\npertinent provisions of the Directive, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive\n\u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006). \nDirective, Enclosure 2, supra n 20, at \u00b6 18.\n28\n6\nhave been controverted.\u201d   \u201cThe applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence\n25\nto rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department\nCounsel, and [Applicant] has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance\ndecision.\u201d  Once it has met its initial burden of production, the burden of persuasion (including any\n26\nburden to disprove a mitigating condition) never shifts to the government.  \n27\nA person who seeks access to classified information seeks to enter a fiduciary relationship\nwith the government predicated upon trust and confidence. It is a relationship that transcends normal\nduty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is because of this special relationship\nthat the government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals\nto whom it grants access to classified information. Decisions under this Directive include, by\nnecessity, consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to\nprotect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified\ninformation. Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically provides that any adverse industrial\nsecurity clearance decision shall be \"in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\" Nothing in this decision should be\nconstrued to suggest I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied\ndecision as to Applicant's loyalty or patriotism.\nCONCLUSIONS          \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate legal\nprecepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly above, I conclude the following\nwith respect to each allegation set forth in the SOR:\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations)          \nFinancial considerations become a security concern when a person has significant delinquent\ndebts. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal or\nunethical acts to generate funds to meet financial obligations. Similarly, individuals who are\nfinancially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligation to\nprotect classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life provides\nan indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life. Failure or inability to live within\none\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations.28\n\n7\nI have considered all the financial considerations disqualifying conditions (FC DC), and\nconclude that FC DC 19(a) (\u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d) and FC DC 19(c) (\u201ca\nhistory of not meeting financial obligations\u201d) apply. While his 2001 bankruptcy is a legal method\nof discharging debt, it also shows that, at that point in time, he was unable to, and did not, satisfy his\ndebts or meet his financial obligations.  Within three years he was again delinquent on some of the\nSOR-listed debts, adding to his history of financial irresponsibility that continues to date. Although\nhe provided proof of resolution of the debts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b, his uncorroborated\nstatements that he has made payments and resolution agreements since February concerning three\nof the debts are insufficient to meet his burden of proof. His inability to satisfy those debts is further\nestablished by the minimal payments he says he has agreed to make toward what is by far the largest\ndebt addressed in the SOR. No other FC DC applies. \n  \nI have considered all the Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC) that might\napply to Applicant\u2019s history of not meeting financial obligations, and inability to satisfy debts. FC\nMC 20(a) (\u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current\nreliability, trustworthiness or good judgment\u201d) does not apply. Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties are\nnumerous and ongoing. The behavior forms a recent pattern of failing to meet financial obligations,\nwhile in his current employment situation. He has not demonstrated that his debt problems are\nunlikely to recur, particularly in view of his $4,849 monthly mortgage payment being 55% of the\n$8,821 net monthly income of his family of four, and the unlikelihood that he could further refinance\nthe home.\nApplicant did not directly assert that financial security concerns should be mitigated under\nFC MC 20(b) (\u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s\ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death,\ndivorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances\u201d).  While he did\nmention that his brief \u201cRudy\u2019s Ribs\u201d business had failed, and some of his debts became delinquent\nduring or near this time, he did not show how the debts related to the failed business. His 2001\nbankruptcy occurred in the middle of steady employment with the post office. Neither the dates nor\nthe nature of the SOR-listed debts suggest they were in any way related to this business, and his\nchoice to leave his postal job to start \u201cRudy\u2019s Ribs\u201d was voluntary and totally within his control.\nAccordingly, Applicant has not shown that FC MC 20(b) applies.\nApplicant made no attempt to establish that FC MC 20(c) (\u201cthe person has received or is\nreceiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being\nresolved or is under control\u201d) applies, and there is no evidence that would support it.  FC MC 20(d)\n(\u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts\u201d)\ndoes not apply either. His uncorroborated assertions, that one debt is paid and he initiated payment\narrangements with two other creditors, and his belated resolution of the two smallest delinquent\ndebts only after receipt of the SOR, do not demonstrate sufficient good-faith efforts to mitigate\nsecurity concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s history of financial irresponsibility and delinquent\nindebtedness. \nFinally, FC MC 20(e) (\u201cthe individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the\npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the\nbasis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue\u201d) does not apply. Applicant\ndid not dispute the validity of any of the SOR-listed debts. FC MC 20(f) has to do with unexplained\n\n8\naffluence, and has no application here.\nWhole Person Analysis           \nApplicant\u2019s history of, and ongoing financial irresponsibility are significant and pervasive.\nHis pattern of delinquent indebtedness resumed shortly after being completely discharged of debt\nin a 2001 Chapter 7 bankruptcy. He voluntarily entered into each credit arrangement that he\nsubsequently dishonored, and gave no reason to believe that any of these problems could not have\nbeen avoided by making better choices. His irresponsibility is recent and ongoing. He is a fully\nmature and experienced individual, with about 27 years of combined military service and federal\nemployment, so neither youth nor inexperience can mitigate his conduct. He demonstrated no\nrehabilitative efforts and gave no indication such problems are unlikely to recur.\nAlthough he did document resolution of the two smallest of the SOR-listed delinquent debts,\nApplicant submitted neither evidence nor other information from which any mitigating condition or\ncircumstance might be applied to lessen the security concerns raised by the potential for conflict of\ninterest, coercion, pressure or manipulation created by his overall financial considerations. For the\nreasons stated, I conclude Applicant has not demonstrated that it is clearly consistent with the\ninterests of national security to grant him access to classified information.\nFORMAL FINDINGS           \nFormal Findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a: \nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b: \nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION            \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

Michael Lyles, Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\n\n2\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant used marijuana at varying frequency from approximately 1994 until early January\n2005. Before ending his marijuana use in 2005, he began his unprescribed use of hydro-codeine in\nJanuary 2004, and used hydro-codeine until June 2005. His unsubstantiated evidence in mitigation\ndoes not overcome his history of drug use under the drug involvement guideline. Though his\nhandgun charge was cancelled in August 2005, his failure to adequately explain why he had a gun\nin his automobile precludes him from mitigating the pattern of criminal behavior under the criminal\nconduct guideline. Clearance is denied. \n\nSTATEMENT OF CASE \nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for Applicant. On September 26, 2006, under Executive Order 10865 and\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5200.6, including revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued\nDecember 29, 2005, and implemented by the Department of Defense effective September 1, 2006,\nDOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the reasons for its security concerns raised\nunder the drug involvement guideline (Guideline H), and the criminal conduct guideline (Guideline\nJ) of the Directive. In his answer dated October 3, 2006, Applicant requested a decision be made on\nthe record in lieu of a hearing. \nA copy of the Government\u2019s File of Relevant Material (FORM, the Government\u2019s evidence\nin support of the SOR) was sent to Applicant on January 12, 2007. Applicant received the FORM\non January 24, 2007. Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM was due by February 23, 2007. No response\nwas submitted. The case was assigned to me for decision on March 22, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe SOR alleges drug involvement and criminal conduct. Applicant admitted the factual\nallegations. His objective for seeking a security clearance is to provide more opportunities for his\nson that were not available for Applicant. He has done work on several military installations around\nthe country and appreciates the meaning of national security. He believes he deserves forgiveness.\nApplicant is 33 years old and employed as a project engineer with a defense contractor. He seeks a\nsecret security clearance. \nConcerning the first drug allegation (1.a.), Applicant indicated the bulk of his marijuana use\nwas in college. According to his security clearance application (SCA), he attended college in about\n1993, during the time he was an intern at the Department of Energy in 1993 (Item 4). Applicant used\nthe drug to: (1) increase his chances of getting accepted by his peers; (2) contend with a bad\nrelationship with his father; and, (3) medicate serious back pain caused by a football injury and\nseveral car accidents. Applicant used the drug twice during New Year\u2019s Eve and New Year\u2019s day\n2005 \u201cfor old time\u2019s sake.\u201d He has used no marijuana since then. (Item 3). Applicant used hydro-\ncodeine (1.b.) between January 2004 and June 2005 to reduce lower back pain. He was offered the\ndrug as a gift. When the intensity of his back pain reduced, Applicant replaced his hydro-codeine use\nwith over-the-counter medications. \nIn October 1994, Applicant was arrested for possession of marijuana (1.c.). He pled guilty,\nperformed community service and was fined. Twelve months later, Applicant was cited for the same\noffense. This time he paid a $500.00 fine, and his driving privileges in the state were revoked for one\nyear.\nIn May 1998 (1.e.), Applicant\u2019s friend needed  a ride to the airport, and \u201cbeing the Good\nSamaritan,\u201dApplicant agreed he would drive the friend. They were arrested and charged with (1)\nconspiracy to sell/deliver controlled substance marijuana, a felony, (2) possession with intent to\nsell/distribute marijuana, felony, (3) possession of marijuana, felony, and (4) maintaining a\nvehicle/dwelling of controlled substance, a felony. He pled guilty to a misdemeanor of maintaining\na vehicle/dwelling of a controlled substance. He was sentenced to 45 months incarceration, placed\non 24 months probation, and fined $200.00. Though Applicant maintains that he was only providing\n\n4\na ride for his friend to the airport, Applicant pled guilty to the plea bargain due to insufficient funds\nand a lack of confidence his friend would tell the truth at trial. Applicant no longer associates with\ndrug users and is more conscious of the individuals he associates with.\nThe drug offenses in 1.c., 1.d., and 1.e. constitute criminal behavior (2.a. of the SOR) that\nApplicant acknowledges. His answer to 2.b. is that the charge (handgun in a vehicle) was cancelled\nas the gun is legally owned. \nApplicant noted he traveled to foreign countries and accomplished \u201cvarious lifetime\nachievements,\u201d but none as important as being told that his wife was expecting a child. Applicant\nprovided no evidence about those achievements. He provided no additional evidence about his\nreputation on or off the job. \nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth guidelines containing disqualifying conditions (DC)\nand mitigating conditions (MC) that should be given binding consideration in making security\nclearance determinations. These conditions must be considered in every case along with the general\nfactors of the whole person concept. However, the conditions are not automatically determinative\nof the decision in any case nor can they supersede the Administrative Judge's reliance on his own\ncommon sense. \nBurden of Proof\nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, that conditions exist in the\npersonal or professional history of the applicant which disqualifies, or may disqualify, the applicant\nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484\nU.S. 518, 531 (1988) \u201c[T]he Directive presumes there is a nexus or rational connection between\nproven conduct under any of the Criteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.\u201d ISCR\nCase No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996) (quoting DISCR Case No. 92-1106 (App. Bd. Oct.\n7, 1993)). \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the\nburden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. \u201c[S]ecurity clearance\ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d See Egan, 481 U.S. at 531; see\nDirective E2.2.2.\nDrug Involvement (Guideline H)\nImproper or illegal involvement with drugs raises questions regarding an individual\u2019s\nw1illingness or ability to protect classified information. Drug abuse may impair social or\noccupational functioning.\nCriminal Conduct (Guideline J)\nViolating the law shows poor judgment and unreliability.\n\n5\nCONCLUSIONS\nDrug abuse raises questions about a person\u2019s willingness to comply with drug laws and other\nlaws, as well as security rules and regulations. If a person demonstrates a propensity to violate the\nlaw by using illegal or unprescribed drugs to satisfy his personal desires, then there is good\nlikelihood he may adopt the same posture toward security regulations he disagrees with. Applicant\nused marijuana at varying frequencies from 1994 (during college) until January 2005. Drug\nInvolvement (DI) disqualifying condition (DC) 25. (a) (any drug abuse) applies to Applicant\u2019s\nmarijuana use, while DI DC 25. (a) and DI DC 24. (b) (drug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use\nof a legal drug in a manner that deviates form approved medical direction) apply to Applicant\u2019s\nhydro-codeine use from January 2004 to June 2005. It is reasonable to infer that marijuana use\nquickly became an integral part of his lifestyle as evidenced by his convictions for possession of\nmarijuana in 1994 and 1995. The convictions exemplify poor judgment in that he was willing to\npossess and/or use the drug while driving his automobile. Applicant\u2019s conviction in 1998 for\nmaintaining a vehicle/dwelling where a controlled substance is located raises even more concerns\nabout the level of his involvement with marijuana. These concerns are substantiated by the severity\nof the sentence that included probation for two years. DI DC 25. \u00a9) (illegal drug possession,\nincluding cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution . . . ) applies.\nThere are four mitigating conditions that may apply to the evidence of drug abuse. DI\nmitigating condition (MC) 26. (a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\nhappened under circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) does not apply as his drug use did not end\nuntil June 2005, less than 18 months before the date of the SOR. DI MC 26. (b) (a demonstrated\nintent not to abuse any drugs in the future) has not been established due to the lack of independent\nevidence to conclude Applicant\u2019s drug use is clearly in the past. The reason for Applicant\u2019s decision\nto use marijuana at the beginning of 2005, \u201cfor old time\u2019s sake,\u201d does not inspire sufficient\nconfidence to conclude he will not use the same reason to use the drug in the future. The DI\nguideline is found against Applicant. \nA pattern of criminal conduct (CC) raises doubt about a persons\u2019s judgment, reliability and\ntrustworthiness. Applicant\u2019s criminal behavior from 1994 to August 2005 represents a pattern of\nadverse conduct that activates CC DC 31. (a) (a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses)\napplies. Applicant\u2019s two convictions in 1994 and 1995 for marijuana possession, and the 1998\nconviction for maintaining a dwelling where a controlled substance is located fall within the scope\nof CC DC 31. (a). Even though Applicant considers himself innocent of any of the offenses he was\ncharged with in 1998,  he has provided insufficient extenuation or explanation to warrant the\napplication of CC MC 32. \u00a9) (evidence that the person did not commit the offense), due to his\ncriminal record for the same type of offense before 1998. The fact that the handgun offense in\nAugust 2005 was canceled because he had a license for the gun, does not eliminate the poor\njudgment associated with carrying a handgun in a automobile. There is no evidence Applicant is a\nlaw enforcement officer; there is no evidence he is a correctional officer or a deputy; there is no\nevidence Applicant had a specific reason for possessing the handgun in an automobile. The fact the\ngun was licensed to him does not adequately explain why he had the weapon in his vehicle. The CC\nguideline is found against Applicant.\n\n6\nApplicant\u2019s failure to satisfy the mitigating conditions under the specific guidelines is not\nnecessarily dispositive, as the general factors of the whole person model may support an overall\nfinding in Applicant\u2019s favor. While Applicant\u2019s drug use in 1994 and 1995 is extenuated by his\nyouthful age during the period, Applicant continued to use marijuana, and then hydro-codeine until\nhe was 31 years old. The three drug convictions demonstrate the degree to which drugs were a part\nof Applicant\u2019s lifestyle. While he claims that his life has changed now that he knows he will be a\nfather, and he no longer associates with drug users, he has failed to produce the necessary evidence\nunder 2. (a)(6) (the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes)\nto support his drug-free claim in the future. Without ample evidence of permanent behavioral\nchanges, there are inadequate bases for me to find for Applicant under the DI and CC guidelines. \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nParagraph 1 (Drug Involvement, Guideline H):\nAGAINST THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph a.\nAgainst the Applicant.\nSubparagraph b.\nAgainst the Applicant. \nSubparagraph c.\nAgainst the Applicant.\nSubparagraph d.\nAgainst the Applicant.\nSubparagraph e.\nAgainst the Applicant.\nParagraph 2 (Criminal Conduct, Guideline J):\nAGAINST THE APPLICANT.\nSubparagraph a.\nAgainst the Applicant.\nSubparagraph b.\nAgainst the Applicant.\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

In the past six\nmonths, he has satisfied all of them, attended credit counseling, and created a budget to which he has\nadhered. Clearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn November 3, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) explaining why they concluded it was not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance. This action was taken under\nExecutive Order 10865, dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive 5220.6, dated\nJanuary 2, 1992, as amended. Applicant answered the SOR on January 12, 2007, admitting all of the\nallegations, and requesting a hearing.\nThe case was assigned to me on March 26, 2007. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on March\n29, 2007, scheduling it for April 18, 2007. The hearing was held as scheduled. During the hearing,\nI received four government exhibits, five Applicant exhibits, and Applicant\u2019s testimony. At the\nApplicant\u2019s request, I left the record open through May 4, 2007 to allow him to submit additional\nexhibits. That day, he submitted one additional exhibit which I marked and received as Exhibit F.\nDOHA received the transcript on May 8, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT \nThe SOR admissions are incorporated as findings of fact. In addition, I make the following\nfindings of fact.\nApplicant is a 43-year-old married man with three children. He is a U.S. Army veteran who\nserved from 1981 through his retirement in 2003. In the early 1990s, Applicant briefly left the Army\nto obtain a college degree. Upon returning, he attended officer training school, became a\ncommissioned officer in 1994, and retired as a captain.1\nCurrently, Applicant provides intelligence training for troops preparing to deploy to overseas\ncombat theaters.

In approximately 1999, they grew estranged.  Shortly thereafter, a physician\n3\ndiagnosed his wife with depression, unbeknownst to Applicant.  During the estrangement, and his\n4\nwife\u2019s struggle with depression, her management of their finances lapsed.5\nApplicant and his wife ultimately reconciled when he returned from his most recent overseas\nassignment in 2004. He discovered upon returning, however, that many of their debts had grown\ndelinquent. He then began requesting credit reports, and negotiating settlements with creditors. In\nJanuary 2007, he enrolled in an online credit counseling course.  By the end of that month, he had\n6\nsatisfied subparagraphs the debts listed in subparagraphs 1.h.,  1.j.,  1.k.,  and 1.m.\n7\n8\n9\n10\nIn February 2007, Applicant refinanced his home. As a condition for the execution of the\nhome refinance, he satisfied subparagraph 1.c.  After the settlement, he received approximately\n11\n$16,700 which he used to satisfy subparagraphs 1.a.,  1.f,  1.i.,  and 1.l.  His new, post-refinance\n12\n13\n14\n15\nmonthly mortgage payment is only nominally higher than the original monthly mortgage payment.16\nDuring the course of Applicant\u2019s research into his delinquencies, he discovered that\nsubparagraph 1.e. was the same as subparagraph 1.c., and subparagraph 1.g. was the same as\nsubparagraph 1.f.  He was unable to locate the creditor to whom he allegedly owed $90, as alleged\n17\nin subparagraph 1.b. When he contacted the phone company whom he allegedly owed $313, as listed\n\nTr. 21.\n18\nTr. 50.\n19\nWife\u2019s Statement, dated January 11, 2007, as included in Answer, attachment 5.\n20\n4\nin subparagraph 1.d., he was told the debt had been transferred to a collection agency. He then\ncontacted the collection agency to whom he was referred, and was informed that it had no account\nin his name on file.18\nCurrently, Applicant adheres to a budget he developed in January 2007 through the credit\ncounseling course. He has approximately $2,500 of income remaining each month after expenses.19\nApplicant answered \u201cno\u201d in response to Question 38 (In the past 7 years, have you been over\n180 days delinquent on any debt(s)?), and Question 39 (Are you currently over 90 days delinquent\non any debt(s)?). When he completed the SF 86, he was deployed overseas. When he contacted his\nwife to ask her about their finances, she reassured him that none were delinquent.20\nCurrently, Applicant shares the responsibility for managing the family finances with his wife.\nHe monitors all of their outgoing expenses\nPOLICIES\nThe adjudicative guidelines, as revised December 29, 2005, and implemented by the DoD\nSeptember 1, 2006 apply to the analysis of this case. In addition to brief introductory explanations\nfor each guideline, they are divided into those that may be considered in deciding whether to deny\nor revoke an individual\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information (disqualifying conditions)\nand those that may be considered in deciding whether to grant an individual\u2019s eligibility for access\nto classified information (mitigating conditions).\nBecause the entire process is a scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person\nconcept,\u201d all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and\nunfavorable, should be considered in making a meaningful decision. Specifically these are: (1) the\nnature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances; (2) the frequency and recency\nof the conduct; (3) the age of the applicant; (4) the motivation of the applicant, and the extent to\nwhich the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the\nconsequences; (5) the absence or presence of rehabilitation; and (6) the probability that the\ncircumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future.\nThe following adjudicative guidelines are raised:\nGuideline F - Financial Considerations: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s\nmeans, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control,\nlack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can\nraise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information.\n\nSee generally, Directive, Sec. 2.3, Sec. 2.5.3, Sec. 3.2, and Sec. 4.2.\n21\n5\nGuideline E - Personal Conduct: Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of\ncandor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect\nclassified information.\nConditions pertaining to these adjudicative guidelines that could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security concerns, are set forth and discussed\nin the conclusions below.\nSince the protection of national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision\nin each case must be reached by applying the standard that the issuance of the clearance is \u201cclearly\nconsistent with the national interest.\u201d   In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those\n21\nconclusions that are based on the evidence contained in the record.\nThe government is responsible for presenting evidence to establish facts in the SOR that have\nbeen controverted. The applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by the Government, and has the ultimate burden\nof persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\nCONCLUSIONS\nFinancial Considerations\nBetween 1999 and 2004, Applicant accrued approximately $50,000 of delinquent debt.\nFinancial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) 19(c): A history of not meeting financial\nobligations, and FC DC 19(e): Consistent spending beyond one\u2019s means, which may be indicated\nby excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-to-income ratio, and/or other\nfinancial analysis, apply.\nApplicant\u2019s financial delinquencies were caused primarily by marital difficulties that\noccurred simultaneously with consecutive extended overseas deployments. After returning from his\nmost recent deployment and reconciling in 2004, he obtained credit reports, contacted creditors, and\nbegan negotiating settlements. After identifying the delinquencies, he gradually began satisfying\nthem. He satisfied the remaining ones in February 2007 through the cash generated from the\nrefinance of his home. Since then, he has enrolled in  financial counseling, and organized a budget\nto which he has been adhering. Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition (FC MC) 20(b): the\nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss\nof employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances), FC MC 20 (c) :the\nperson has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications\nthat the problem is being resolved or is under control, and FC MC 20(d):the individual initiated a\ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts, apply. Applicant has\nmitigated the financial considerations security concern.\n\n6\nPersonal Conduct\nApplicant\u2019s SF-86 omission of financial information triggers the issue of whether Personal\nConduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) 16(a): deliberate omission concealment, or falsification\nof relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar\nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities,\napplies. Applicant was stationed abroad when he completed the SF-86. His responses were consistent\nwith the information that his wife provided when he contacted her to help him complete the\napplication. I conclude his omissions were not intentional, and that there are no personal conduct\nsecurity concerns.\nWhole Person Concept\nApplicant has spent nearly his entire adult life serving the country either through the military\nor through the support of the military. Unfortunately, the stress inherent with serving the country\nduring wartime led to marital problems and the neglect of his finances.\nSince returning from his most recent deployment three years ago, Applicant reconciled with\nhis wife, organized his finances, and satisfied all of his delinquent debt. Given his strong character,\nthe cause of the delinquencies, and his intensive efforts at financial rehabilitation, I am firmly\nconvinced that the problem will not recur. Clearance is granted.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nParagraph 1 \u2013 Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.m:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2 - Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

She has four\nadult children.  She had 23 delinquent debts, including several state and federal tax liens.  She\nmitigated the financial considerations and personal conduct trustworthiness concerns.  Eligibility for\nan ADP I/II/III position is granted.\n\nAdjudication of trustworthiness cases for ADP I, II, and III positions are resolved using the provisions of DoD\n1\nDirective 5220.6 (Directive), pursuant to the memorandum from Carol A. Haave, Deputy Under Secretary of Defense\nfor Counterintelligence and Security to DOHA Director, Adjudication of Trustworthiness Cases (Nov. 19, 2004).\nPursuant to Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended\n2\nand modified, and the Directive.\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a\nposition of trust for Applicant .  On September 26, 2006, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons\n1\n2\n(SOR) detailing the basis for its decision\u2013trustworthiness concerns raised under Guideline F\n(Financial Considerations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the revised Adjudicative\nGuidelines of the Directive issued on December 29, 2005, and implemented by the Department of\nDefense, effective September 1, 2006.  Applicant answered the SOR in writing on November 8, 2006\nand elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge.  The case was assigned to me on\nFebruary 16, 2007.  On April 5, 2007, I convened a hearing to consider whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a trustworthiness determination for\nApplicant.  The Government and the Applicant submitted exhibits that were admitted into evidence.\nDOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on April 18, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant's admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated as findings of fact.  After a\ncomplete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and full consideration of that evidence,\nI make the following additional findings of fact:\nApplicant is 57 years old, married and divorced five times, and has four adult children.  She\nis a computer programmer who is self-employed and has been since 1985.  She suffered a loss of\nincome from contractual work after September 11, 2001, until December 2001.  After January 2002,\nshe obtained some work, but in August 2002 contracted to perform computer work in a northwestern\nstate at twice the rate she earned in her former contractual arrangement.  That position lasted eight\nmonths instead of the eight years originally planned not due to Applicant\u2019s fault or actions.  When\nshe moved to her current state of residence, her income dropped by half again.  Applicant has been\ngainfully employed since 2004 on a contractual basis with her current employer, a health insurance\ncontractor for the federal government.  Her work is rated highly, and her supervisor considers her\nvery energetic and dependable.  She also works as a pastor in her church. (Tr. 104, 107, 114-117,\n186-193, 206, 228; Exhibits 1)\nApplicant\u2019s sister, daughter, pastor, friend, and supervisor testified about her generous nature.\nApplicant purchased a used car for her mother, and gave money to friends and family when they had\nfinancial difficulty.  No all of these people returned the money to Applicant.  Applicant now realizes\nshe has to help herself first and has reduced her donations and loans to other people. (Tr. 24-88)\nThe SOR alleges 23 delinquent debts owed by Applicant.  These delinquent debts include\nfive tax debts to different states and one to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) arising from under\n\n4\npayment of estimated taxes on her contractual income as her income rose in certain years, six\neducation loans, and the remainder are debts owed to various creditors.  After the SOR came to\nApplicant, she worked to pay these debts in full or on an installment plan, to dispute debts not owed\nby her, or settle for lesser amounts.  Previously, Applicant petitioned for Chapter 13 bankruptcy\nprotection on February 25, 2002, to resolve her delinquent debts.  She was to pay $2,000 for 60\nmonths to the bankruptcy trustee to repay her delinquent debts.  Applicant could not afford those\npayments and the bankruptcy order was amended on June 27, 2002, to require payments of $1,500\nper month.  On August 1, 2002, the second amended order was signed by the bankruptcy judge\nchanging the payments to $2,200 per month.  On November 6, 2003, the trustee filed a motion to\ndismiss the bankruptcy for \u201cmaterial default in plan payments.\u201d  Applicant was not making the\n$2,200 monthly payments.  On March 31, 2004, the bankruptcy judge dismissed the case on that\nbasis and the case was closed.  Between then and September 26, 2006, when the SOR was sent to\nApplicant, she did nothing to resolve the delinquent debts listed in the SOR, except for two small\ntax liens which she resolved. (Tr. 110-113, 116, 122, 126, 198-225; Exhibits 2, 3, A, B, C, L)\nThe results of Applicant\u2019s actions on her delinquent debts are as follows:\nSOR ALLEGATION AND AMOUNT\nFINDING AND EVIDENCE\n1.b.

(Tr. 166, 206, 228;\nExhibits X, Y, Z)\nApplicant completed her Questionnaire for a Public Trust Position (SF 85P) on May 14,\n2004.  She then resigned it on November 12, 2004.  She certified that her answers were \u201ctrue,\ncomplete, and correct to the best of (her) knowledge and belief and (were) made in good faith.\u201d\nQuestion 22 inquired of Applicant whether in the past seven years she or any company owned by her\nfiled for bankruptcy, had been subject to a tax lien, or had a legal judgment rendered against her for\na debt.  Applicant answered \u201cyes\u201d to that question, and she listed the 2002 Chapter 13 bankruptcy\nshe filed.  Her tax liens were listed in her bankruptcy, and she did not list them separately in answer\nto Question 22.a. because she assumed she was making full disclosure by listing the bankruptcy.\nAlso, Applicant claims she had difficulty reading the question and misunderstood it.  She denied a\ndeliberate falsification of information.  Question 22.b. inquired if Applicant was over 180 days\ndelinquent on any loan or financial obligation.  Applicant answered \u201cyes\u201d and listed her student loan.\nShe did not list her delinquent debts that are set forth in SOR subparagraphs 1.b. to 1.p.  Applicant\n\n6\nunderstood the question to require listing of debts funded by the Federal Government, which would\nrefer only to her student loans. (Tr. 172-176, 226; Exhibits 1, A)\nPOLICIES\nAs Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information\nbearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to\noccupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d Department of the Navy\nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 527 (1988).  The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his\ndesignee to grant applicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that\nit is clearly consistent the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation with Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960).  By direction of the Under Secretary of Defense for\nCounterintelligence and Security, adjudications of cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense\nSecurity Service or the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) for a trustworthiness determination\nshall be conducted under the provisions of the Directive.  Eligibility for a position of trust is\npredicated upon the applicant meeting the guidelines contained in the Directive and a finding it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so. See Directive \u00b6 2.3.  An applicant \u201chas the\nultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or\ncontinue his trustworthiness determination.\u201d See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15\nThe adjudication process is based on the whole person concept.  Enclosure 2 of the Directive\nsets forth personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating\nconditions (MC) under each guideline that must be carefully considered in making the overall\ncommon sense determination required.  The decision to deny an individual eligibility to occupy a\nposition of trust is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  See Exec. Or.\n10865 \u00a7 7.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President\nand the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a such a determination.\nIn evaluating the trustworthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess\nthe adjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6 6.3 of the Directive.  Those assessments include:  (1) the\nnature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, and\nthe extent of knowledgeable participation; (3) how recent and frequent the behavior was; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6)\nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood\nof continuation or recurrence (See Directive, Section E2.2.1. of Enclosure 2).  Because each case\npresents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that the factors exhaust\nthe realm of human experience or that the factors apply equally in every case.  Moreover, although\nadverse information concerning a single condition may not be sufficient for an unfavorable\ndetermination, the individual may be disqualified if available information reflects a recent or\nrecurring pattern of questionable judgment, irresponsibility, or other behavior specified in the\nGuidelines.\nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal\nor professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being\neligible to occupy a position of trust.  The Directive presumes a nexus or rational connection\nbetween proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an\n\n7\napplicant\u2019s trustworthiness suitability.  See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).\nAll that is required is proof of facts and circumstances that indicate an applicant is at risk for\nmishandling classified information, or that an applicant does not demonstrate the high degree of\njudgment, reliability, or trustworthiness required of persons handling classified information.  ISCR\nCase No. 00-0277, 2001 DOHA LEXIS 335 at **6-8 (App. Bd. 2001).  Once the Government has\nestablished a prima facie case by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut,\nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate\nburden of demonstrating that is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his\ntrustworthiness determination. ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. 2002).  \u201cAny doubt as to\nwhether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved\nin favor of the national security.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E2.2.2\nBased upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative\nguidelines most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:\nGuideline F: Financial Considerations: The Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s\nmeans, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment,\nor unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which could raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  An individual\nwho is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nCompulsive gambling is a concern is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes including\nespionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a security\nconcern.  It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.\nGuideline E: Personal Conduct: The Concern: Conduct involving questionable judgment,\nlack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  Of\nspecial interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance\nprocess or any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\n\u201cThe standard that must be met for . . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all\navailable information, the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that  . . .\nassigning the person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d\n(Regulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1)  Appendix 8 of the Regulation sets forth the adjudicative policy, as well as\nthe disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) associated with each guideline.\nDoD contractor personnel are afforded the adjudication procedures contained in the Directive.\n(Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1)\nCONCLUSIONS\nGuideline F: The Government showed Applicant has 23 delinquent debts.  These debts\ninclude several tax liens for underpaid estimated taxes.  The disqualifying conditions applicable are\n\n8\nFinancial Considerations Disqualifying Condition \u00b619.a. (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts),\nand \u00b619.c. (a history of not meeting financial obligations).\nApplicant demonstrated that she has repaid all but two debts that she is disputing, and has\ninstallment payment agreements for state tax liens, her educational loans, and is making an offer and\ncompromise for her federal tax lien debts.  She also showed she did not spend frivolously, but was\ntoo generous with loans and gifts of money to her family and friends.  She has now stopped that\nactivity and is concentrating on her own finances.  She also attempted to repay the debts in 2002 and\n2003 through the Chapter 13 bankruptcy, but the payments were too much for her finances after\nabout two years and paying approximately $24,000 to the bankruptcy trustee.  The trustee would\nhave disbursed those payments to creditors, so some money would have been paid to them between\n2002 and 2004.  Applicant also lost her job in 2002 after she had married for the fifth time, and\nsuffered decreased income after September 2001, both events adversely affected her ability to repay\nher debts.  The mitigating conditions applicable are Paragraph 20.b. (the conditions that resulted in\nthe financial problem were largely beyond the Applicant\u2019s control through a loss or diminution of\nemployment, a business downturn, and divorce, and Applicant acted responsibly under the\ncircumstances), Paragraph 20.d. (Applicant initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors\nor otherwise resolve debts), and Paragraph 20.e. (Applicant has a reasonable basis to dispute the\nlegitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof\nto substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue).\nApplicant meets all these mitigating conditions based on the evidence adduced at the hearing.\nGuideline E: The Government alleged a potential disqualification under Personal Conduct\nDisqualifying Condition (PC DC) \u00b616(a), (the deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of\nrelevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or\nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits\nor status determines security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities).  Applicant did not disclose specifically her tax liens.  Nor did she disclose all her\ndelinquent debts .\nWhen a falsification allegation is controverted or denied, the government has the burden of\nproving it. Proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove an applicant\u2019s state of\nmind when the omission occurred. An administrative judge must consider the record evidence as a\nwhole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial evidence concerning an applicant\u2019s state\nof mind at the time the omission occurred. ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004)\n(explaining holding in ISCR Case No. 02-23133 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004).\nThe Applicant disclosed her 2002 Chapter 13 bankruptcy which included her debts to that\ntime, including her tax liens.  She made payments into that bankruptcy for about two years.\nApplicant\u2019s explanation that she misunderstood that question and meant to disclose all her debts by\ndisclosing her bankruptcy is reasonable and a credible explanation having observed her demeanor\nat the hearing.  I reach the same conclusion about her answer to Question 22.b.  I can understand how\nApplicant would have limited her answer to that question to her student loans because she\nunderstood the question to be limited to loans or debts funded or guaranteed by the Federal\ngovernment.  Between the two disclosures she made in answer to Question 22 in both its subparts,\nshe made full disclosure to the Government that she had financial problems in the past, and there was\nno deliberate falsification.\n\n9\nWhole Person Analysis\n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a\" trustworthiness decision. Directive\nE2.2.1.  \u201cAvailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and\nunfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d Id.  In evaluating Applicant\u2019s case,\nI have considered the adjudicative process factors listed in the Directive \u00b6 E2.2.1.\nUnder this analysis, I conclude Applicant\u2019s financial situation was serious and she should\nhave paid more attention to these matters.  She should not have been so generous with friends and\nrelatives in giving or loaning them money.  She needed to monitor her income and expenses more\nclosely, while making full use of her business accountant to avoid tax problems.  Her conduct was\nfrequent and recent.  However, she did suffer economic loss in 2001 and 2002 from a business\ndownturn, loss of employment, and a divorce and move to another state where she currently resides.\nApplicant exhibited she learned from her experiences and was embarrassed by them.  Her current\nincome is sufficient to pay her remaining debts and avoid the recurrence of such problems.  She has\nmade changes in her behavior also to prevent a repeat of such actions.  I conclude there is no\npotential for pressure or coercion, nor for a recurrence of such behavior based on the changes she\nmade in her business and personal life.\nTherefore, I conclude the financial considerations trustworthiness concern for Applicant.  I\nalso conclude the personal conduct trustworthiness concern for Applicant on the basis of her\ncredibility and lack of deliberate intent to falsify.  Lastly, I conclude the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d for\nApplicant.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.  Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.x:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2.  Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a to 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for assignment to sensitive duties.  Her\napplication for eligibility for an ADP I/II/III position is granted.\n\n10\nPhilip S. Howe\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Nagel, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\n Decision\n______________\nWESLEY, Roger C., Administrative Judge:\nHISTORY OF CASE\nOn November 19, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA),\npursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6\n(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant,\nwhich detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding\nunder the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or\ncontinue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an\nadministrative judge to determine whether clearance should be granted, continued,\ndenied or revoked.\nApplicant responded to the SOR on May 7, 2008, and requested a hearing.  The\ncase was assigned to me on July 14, 2008, and was scheduled for hearing on July 29,\n2008.  A hearing was held on July 29, 2008, for the purpose of considering whether it\nwould be clearly consistent with the national interest to grant, continue, deny, or revoke\nApplicant\u2019s security clearance.  At hearing, the Government's case consisted of three\nexhibits; Applicant relied on one witness (himself) and no exhibits.  The transcript (R.T.)\nSeptember 30, 2008\n\n2\nwas received on August 6, 2008.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings,\nexhibits, and testimony, eligibility to access classified information is granted.\nBesides its two exhibits, the Government requested administrative notice of seven\ndocuments:  Background Note: Pakistan, U.S. Department of State (May 2007); Country\nSpecific Information: Pakistan, U.S. Department of State (September 2007); Country\nReports on Human Rights Practices - 2007, Pakistan, U.S. Department of State (March\n2008); Travel Warning, Pakistan, U.S. Department of State (September 2007); CRS\nReport to Congress: Pakistan-U.S. Relations (April 2008); CRS Report to Congress,\nWeapons of Mass Destruction: Trade Between North Korea and Pakistan (November\n2006); Annual Threat Assessment of the director of the National Intelligence (January\n2007).\nAdministrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for\nadministrative proceedings.  See ISCR Case No. 05-11292, at 4 n.1 (App. Bd. April 12,\n2007); ISCR Case No. 02-24875, at 2 (App. Bd. October 12, 2006).  Administrative\nnotice is appropriate for noticing facts or government reports that are well known.   See\nStein, Administrative Law, Sec. 25.01 (Bender & Co. 2006).  For good cause shown,\nadministrative notice was granted with respect to the above-named background reports\naddressing the geopolitical situation in India.  Administrative notice was extended to the\ndocuments themselves, consistent  with the provisions of Rule 201 of Fed. R. Evid.  This\nnotice did  not foreclose Applicant from challenging the accuracy and reliability of the\ninformation contained in the reports addressing Pakistan\u2019s current state.  \nSUMMARY OF PLEADINGS\nUnder Guideline B, Applicant is alleged to (a) have a mother who is a citizen of\nPakistan and resides in the U.S.; (b) have a brother who is a citizen of Pakistan and\nresides in the U.S., (c) have at least one sister who is a citizen of Pakistan and is a\nresident of the U.S., (d) have at least one sister who is a citizen and resident of\nPakistan, (e) have a sister who is a citizen of  Pakistan and a resident of India, (f) be\nfriends with and keep in contact with an important Pakistan government person\u2019s (VIP)\nson, who he visits when he travels to Pakistan, and (g) traveled to Pakistan in 1998 and\n2003. \nFor his answer, Applicant admitted most of the allegations in the SOR with\nexplanations.  He claimed his mother could not apply for U.S. citizenship because she is\nold and has been in a coma for nine months and is struggling for her life.  He claimed his\nbrother residing in the U.S. is a legal U.S. resident who holds a green card and will be\napplying for U.S. citizenship when he is eligible.  He claimed his sister residing in the\nU.S. is a law abiding resident of the U.S..  He claimed to have little contact with his other\nsisters (one residing in Pakistan and the other residing in India). He claimed his\nfriendship with the son of a Pakistan VIP traces to his college years, and his only\nmeeting with him in Pakistan was in 2003, when their families were visiting Pakistan.\nAnd Applicant claimed he traveled to Pakistan in 1998 to visit his sister and again in\n2003 on a family vacation.\n\n3\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant is a 43-year-old employee of a defense contractor who seeks a security\nclearance.  The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by Applicant are adopted\nas relevant and material findings.  Additional findings follow.\nApplicant\u2019s background\nApplicant was born in Pakistan to parents of Pakistan ancestry and raised in that\ncountry.  He immigrated to the U.S. in 1984 at the age of 19 to pursue his education.\nWhile enrolled in college, he decided to apply for U.S. citizenship (R.T., at 48, 72, 76).\nHe became a naturalized citizen in July 1990 (see ex.1).  He earned both his\nundergraduate and graduate degrees in the field of engineering (see exs. 1 and 2; R.T.,\nat 48, 77).  \nApplicant met his first wife (W1), a U.S. citizen by birth, in college and married her\nin March 1986 (see exs. 1 and 2).  They divorced in May 1992 (ex. 1; R.T., at 79).  He\nhas no children from this marriage.  Applicant remarried in November 1999.  She (W2)\nwas born in Afghanistan and became a naturalized U.S. citizen around 1992 (R.T., at 79-\n80, 109).  Applicant has one child from this marriage (R.T., at 80).\nApplicant\u2019s father was born in India and passed away some years ago.  His\nmother (a Pakistan citizen by birth) came to live with Applicant in 1993 and has resided\nwith Applicant for most of the time since her arrival in the U.S. (R.T., at 49, 92-93).  She\nhas a green card, but does not speak much English.  She is currently bed-ridden in a\nsemi-comatose state (R.T., at 49-50, 91-92).\nApplicant has four living siblings: a brother and three sisters.  His brother is a\nPakistani citizen who has resided in the U.S. since 1993 (R.T., at 54, 94).  His brother\nhas a green card that entitles him to work in the U.S. (see ex. 3; R.T., at 50, 94).  His\nbrother intends to apply for U.,S. citizenship once the Immigration Service grants him\npermanent residence status (R.T., at 54-56).  \nApplicant has one sister (S1) who is both a citizen and resident of Pakistan (see\nex. 2).  S1's spouse is a physics professor.  They have plans to move to the U.S. once\ntheir son and daughter become university eligible to attend U.S. colleges (R.T., at 57-\n60).  Neither S1 nor her husband have any ties to the Pakistan government or national\ngroups (ex. 2; R.T., at 95). \nApplicant has a second sister (S2) who is a Pakistani citizen, residing in India\n(R.T., at 60, 94-95).  She has been married for 20 years and has one child.  She and her\nhusband also plan to immigrate to the U.S. when their child is university eligible (R.T., at\n60-62).  She frequently visits the U.S. to see their mother. \nApplicant\u2019s third sister (S3) is a nationalized U.S. citizen and a homemaker; she\nand her husband have expressed no desire to return to Pakistan  (R.T., at 64, 94-95).\n\n4\nApplicant\u2019s fourth sister is deceased (see ex. 1; R.T., at 62).  Besides his immediate\nfamily members, Applicant has an aunt and many cousins who reside in the U.S.  (R.T.,\nat 78).\nWhile in college, Applicant established a close friendship with the son (A) of a\nPakistan VIP at the time of the hearing (see ex. 2; R.T., at 65, 101).  Applicant and A\nroomed together for two college semesters.  Applicant was a senior at the time; while A\nwas a freshman.  Applicant had a school scholarship but supported himself with various\njobs.  A found these jobs of Applicant to be particularly interesting (R.T., at 101-04).  A\nexpressed reluctance to return to Pakistan while his father was a VIP of the country.\nAlthough Applicant has maintained periodic contact with A (including a brief visit with him\nin the U.S. in 2005), he realizes that he cannot share work-related information with him,\nor any other friends and contacts (R.T., at 67-70).  Applicant does not know A\u2019s father,\nand to the best of his knowledge, A\u2019s father does not know anything about Applicant (see\nex. 2; R.T., at 105).\nSince becoming a U.S. citizen, Applicant has traveled to Pakistan on two\noccasions to see his family: once in 1998 and again in 2003. On the 2003 trip, Applicant\nand W2 made social contact with A and his wife (R.T., at 65-66). He has no plans to\nreturn to Pakistan (R.T., at 89).  He provides no financial support to either of his sisters\nresiding abroad and currently maintains periodic contact with both of them only once or\ntwice a year (ex. 2; R.T., at 95-99).\nApplicant has been fully briefed on protecting classified information and has never\nbeen written up for a security violation (R.T., at 74, 106).  He affirmed his loyalty to the\nU.S. and assures he would bear arms in behalf of the U.S. if called upon (R.T., at 73).\nHe would never do anything to jeopardize U.S. security interests.\nApplicant believes the current Pakistan coalition (at the time of the hearing) is\nfollowing the same pro-western policies of the then president, and is a friend of the U.S.\n(R.T., at 113-15).  While he has little knowledge of the current coalition running Pakistan,\nhe believes that the coalition considers the primary source of terrorism lies in the tribal\nareas of the northwest territories (R.T., at 109-15).  His statements correspond with\nunclassified position papers issued by the U.S. State Department.\nApplicant has no financial interests in Pakistan.  He has considerable cash and a\nhome with substantial equity in the U.S. (R.T., at 81-82).  He has a 401(k) retirement\naccount in the U.S. that is well diversified in U.S. stocks and worth in excess of\n$400,000.00 (R.T., at 83).\nPakistan\u2019s country status\nPakistan is a parliamentary federal republic located in Southeast Asia, with a\npopulation of nearly 170 million See Background Note: Pakistan, U.S. Department of\nState (May 2007).  Pakistan\u2019s government is comprised of an executive (the president), a\nprime minister (the functioning head of government), a bicameral parliament, and a\n\n5\njudiciary.  The judiciary includes a supreme court, provincial high courts, and a federal\nIslamic (or Sharia) court (see id.).\nBackground\nPakistan\u2019s historical roots trace back 4,500 years.  Alexander the Great included\nthe Indus Valley in his empire in 326 B.C., and his ancestors founded the Indo-Greek\nkingdom of Backria (which includes what is today\u2019s Afghanistan), and extended control\nover Peshawar.  (see Background Note: Pakistan, id., at 2).\nPakistan achieved its independence from Great Britain in August 1947.  Still\ndisputed is the independent state of Kashmir (id., at 3).  Concerned over incursions of\nPakistan tribesmen, the Maharajah of Kashmir sought assistance from India (id.).  He\nsigned accession papers with India in October 1947 that permitted Indian accession of\nKashmir.  Pakistan refused to recognize Kashmir\u2019s accession, and the legal status of\nKashmir remains in dispute to this day.  See Country Specific Information: Pakistan, U.S.\nDepartment of State, at 3 (September 2007).  While direct military hostilities between\nIndia and Pakistan across the line of control (LOC) have ceased, militant insurgent\ngroups from the Indian side of the LOC have active bases and supporters operating from\nthe Pakistani side (according to State Department reports) and pose considerable\nthreats to American visitors of the region (id.).\nThe U.S. and Pakistan established diplomatic relations in 1947, following Great\nBritain\u2019s declaration in June 1947 that it would bestow full dominion status of two\nsuccessor states: India and Pakistan (see Background Note: Pakistan, id., at 3).\nPakistan (comprised of West Pakistan and its provinces of Punjab, Sindh, Balochistan,\nand the Northwest Frontier province and East Pakistan with its Bengal province) became\nindependent on August 14, 1947 (id.).  \nPakistan\u2019s independence proved fragile and rife with political and economic\ninstability following the death of the country\u2019s first head of state (Muhammad Ali Jinnah)\nin 1948 and the ensuing assassination of its first prime minister (Liaqat Ali Khan) in 1951.\nIn October 1958, President Iskander Mirza (with military support) suspended his\ncountry\u2019s constitution (adopted just two years before), imposed martial law, and canceled\nthe scheduled elections (see Background Note: Pakistan id.).  President Mirza\u2019s action\nresulted in a military coup, his arrest, and the establishment of a military dictatorship\nunder the rule of General Mohammad Ayub Khan.\n Political and economic turmoil followed and new governments were installed over\nthe next 20 years: some as the result of general elections (such as the Pakistan People\u2019s\nParty or PPP which swept Zulfikar Ali Bhutto into power).  It was under Ali Bhutto\u2019s\ncivilian leadership that Pakistan emerged as a nuclear power in the 1970s.  India\u2019s\nnuclear test in 1974 injected further uncertainty and concern into Pakistan\u2019s relationship\nwith India, and is generally credited as the principal impetus behind President Ali\nBhutto\u2019s decision to make Pakistan a nuclear state (see Background Note: Pakistan id.\nat 10). \n\n6\nPolitical tensions and economic unrest in Pakistan also produced military\ninterventions before the close of the 20  century.  Disputed national elections that\nth\nmarred Bhutto\u2019s declared victory in 1977 spurred anti-government unrest and ultimately\nprompted a military takeover of the Bhutto government in July 1977 and installation of\nArmy chief of staff, Muhammad Zia ul-Haq) as the chief martial law administrator (see\nBackground Note: Pakistan id. at 4).  When Zia assumed power, his military government\narrested Bhutto, tried him on conspiracy charges and hanged him in April 1979 (id.).\nWith Zia\u2019s untimely death in August 1988, the political parties of Benazir Bhutto\nand Muhammad Mawaz Sharif competed for the formation of coalition governments to\nlead Pakistan.  Each party\u2019s efforts were marked ethnic conflict, fragmentation within\ntheir coalitions, corruption and nepotism, which stoked political tensions, created\ngridlock, and contributed to the deterioration of law and order (id., at 5-6). \nFollowing the ouster of Prime Minister Sharif in October 1999, Pakistan\u2019s military,\nled by President Pervez Musharraf, declared a state of emergency and issued the\nprovisional constitutional order that suspended the federal and provincial parliaments,\nplaced the constitution in abeyance, and designated Musharraf as chief executive (see\nBackground Note: Pakistan, id., at 6).  Musharraf\u2019s presidency was extended for five\nyears by referendum in (see Country Specific Information, id, 1).  After the terrorist\nattacks on U.S. soil in September 11, 2001, Pakistan has pledged and provided its\nsupport to the U.S. in its coalition efforts to confront  Al Qaida terrorists and Taliban\nfugitives.  See CRS Report to Congress: Pakistan-U.S. Relations  (April 2008).  \nPolitical unrest, human rights,  and travel warnings\nAnti-American sentiment is widespread among a coalition of Islamic parties in\nPakistan\u2019s parliament (see CRS Report to Congress: Pakistan-U.S. Relations, id., at 14).\nThis coalition controls approximately 20 per cent of the national assembly (long noted for\ntheir adamant expression of anti-American sentiment against the U.S. (see id., at 14).\nThese groups have called for \u201cjihad\u201d against U.S. interests, which they view as a threat\nto Pakistan sovereignty.\nThere can be no question but that the presence of extremist groups operating\nwithin Pakistan continue to target Americans and other western interests, as well as high\nlevel Pakistan government officials and members of minority, indigenous, and religious\ngroups (see CRS Report to Congress: Pakistan-U.S. Relations, id., at 48).   Continued\ntensions in the Middle East also serve to increase the possibilities of violence against\nWestern citizens living and/or working in Pakistan (see Country Specific Information:\nPakistan, supra, at 2; see also, Travel Warning, Pakistan, U.S. Department of State, at 1\n(September 2007)).\nThe U.S. Department of State continues to warn U.S. citizens against non-\nessential travel to Pakistan (especially in the border regions) out of concern for terrorist\nthreats in the country (see Travel Warning, Pakistan, id, at 2).  Terrorists and their\nsympathizers have shown a willingness (based on State Department reports) to attack\n\n  1  Since the hearing, President Musharraf has stepped down as President of Pakistan.  Pakistan\u2019s recently elected\npresident (Asif Ali-Zardari) and widower of the late Benazir Bhutto, who heads one of the country\u2019s coalition partners (the\nPakistan\u2019s People\u2019s Party), is on record of being in full support of Pakistan\u2019s (a) transition from authoritarianism to\ndemocracy and (b) continued allied support of the U.S. war on terrorism.  Neither party to these proceedings has asked\nto reopen the record to explore the potential impact of Pakistan\u2019s political changes in their parliament and executive.\nThese changes, though, do not appear to offer any foreseeable prospects of alteration of the strategic partnership\nbetween Pakistan and the U.S. at this time.  Absent any noticeable shifts in the fundamentals of the state-to-state\nrelationship, there is insufficient reason to reopen the record sua sponte  to explore the political significance of the\nreported changes in Pakistan\u2019s political structure.\n7\ntargets where Americans are known to congregate and visit.  Past attacks have included\n(but are not limited to ) suicide operations, bombing (including vehicle-borne explosives\nand improvised explosive devices), assassinations, car-jacking, assault, or hostage-\ntaking (see id).  Noted past incidents involved American fast food restaurants and other\ncompanies in Karachi in 2005 (resulting in several deaths and multiple injuries) and the\nkilling of an American diplomat, his driver and three others in a suicide bombing in March\n2006 (id).   Fatal bomb attacks have occurred in Islamabad, Peshawar, Quetta, Lahore,\nand other Pakistan cities in 2006 and 2007 (see  Country Specific Information: Pakistan,\nsupra, at 2-3).\nCountry reports on Pakistan reveal a poor Pakistani human rights record.\nReported human rights problems include extrajudicial killings, torture, rape by security\nforces, lack of judicial independence, arbitrary arrest and detention, wide-spread\ncorruption, disappearance and imprisonment of political opponents, and trafficking in\nwomen and children.  See Country Reports on Human Rights Practices - 2007, Pakistan,\nat 19-31, U.S. Department of State (March 2008).  Pakistan\u2019s human rights situation\nworsened in 2007 in the wake of President Musharraf\u2019s decision to impose a 42-day\nstate of emergency (SOE), suspend the constitution, and dismiss the Supreme Court\nand High Provincial Courts operating in the country (id, at 1).  During this 42-days of\nSOE, the government imposed curbs on the media and arrested and/or detained over\n6,000 lawyers, judges, political party workers/leaders, and civil society activists (id.).\nHeightened security risks are extant in Pakistan, too, because of recent weapons\ntechnical transfers and weapons technology competition with various countries.  See\nCRS Report to Congress, Weapons of Mass Destruction: Trade Between North Korea\nand Pakistan, at 2-4, 13 (November 2006).  Among the countries that Pakistan has\nsupplied nuclear technology to are Iran and Libya (see id., at 2).  Pakistan, in turn, has\nsought assistance from both North Korea and China for its own weapons programs (id.\nat 4).  \nU.S.-Pakistan relations\nDespite its poor human rights record, terrorists threats, and active weapons\nprograms, Pakistan remains a principal ally of the U.S. in the war on terror.  After the\nterrorist attacks on U.S. soil on September 11, 2001, Pakistan pledged and provided\nmaterial support to the U.S. in its coalition efforts to confront Al Qaida terrorists and\nTaliban fugitives.  See  CRS Report to Congress: Pakistan-U.S. Relations (April 2008).\nPresident Bush and President Musharraf affirmed a long-term strategic partnership.   In\n1\n\n8\n2004, the U.S. recognized closer bilateral ties with Pakistan by designating Pakistan as a\nmajor non-NATO ally (see  Background Note: Pakistan, supra, at 13).  During a\npresidential visit to Pakistan in March 2006, President Bush joined President Musharraf\nin reaffirming their shared commitment to a broad and lasting strategic partnership (id.). \nToday, cross-border Muslim insurgency linked to Afghanistan\u2019s Taliban continues\nto pose military and political risks for the U.S. in its ongoing war against radical Al Qaida\nand Taliban groups operating in Pakistan\u2019s tribal areas. Counter-insurgency missions will\ndoubtlessly require a good deal of coordinated efforts between the U.S. and its NATO\nallies and Pakistani military forces. Human rights issues will continue to hamper\nPakistan\u2019s efforts to achieve respected democracy for so long as the country\u2019s Supreme\nCourt make-up remains in limbo.  Patience will be required of Pakistan\u2019s friends,\nincluding the U.S. during this critical transitional period. \nPolicies\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to\nClassified Information (effective September 2006) list Guidelines to be considered by\nadministrative judges in the decision-making process covering DOHA cases.  These\nGuidelines require the administrative judge to consider all of the \"Conditions that could\nraise a security concern and may be disqualifying\u201d (Disqualifying Conditions), if any, and\nall of the \"Mitigating Conditions,\" if any, before deciding whether or not a security\nclearance should be granted, continued or denied.  The Guidelines do not require the\nadministrative judge to assess these factors exclusively in arriving at a decision.  In\naddition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, administrative judges must take into\naccount the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in\nE.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which are intended to\nassist the administrative judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication\npolicy factors are pertinent herein:\nForeign Influence\nThe Concern: Foreign contacts and interests may be a security\nconcern if the individual has divided  loyalties or foreign financial interests,\nmay be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group,\norganization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is\nvulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest.  Adjudication\nunder the this Guideline can and should considered the identity of the\nforeign country in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located,\nincluding, but not limited to, such considerations as whether the foreign\ncountry is known to target United States citizens to obtain protected\ninformation and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism   See revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG), \u00b6 6.\n\n9\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the precepts framed by the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an\nApplicant's request for security clearance may be made only upon a threshold finding that\nto do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires\nadministrative judges to make a common sense appraisal of the evidence accumulated in\nthe record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a security clearance\ndepends, in large part, on the relevance and materiality of that evidence. As with all\nadversary proceedings, the Judge may draw only those inferences which have a\nreasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the Judge cannot\ndraw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted\nfact[s] alleged in the Statement of Reasons, and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts\nproven have a material bearing to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a security\nclearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, does not require the\nGovernment to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled or\nabused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security clearance. Rather,\nconsideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the burden of proof shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or\nmitigation of the Government's case.\nAnalysis\nBorn and raised in Pakistan, Applicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1990.\nHe married his wife in 1986 and (following a short marriage and divorce from W1)\nremarried in 1999.  Like Applicant, W2 is a naturalized U.S. citizen.  Security concerns\nfocus on Applicant\u2019s mother and siblings who are Pakistani citizens by birth, and a\nlongtime friend from college who is the son of a Pakistani VIP.  Applicant\u2019s mother resides\nin the U.S. with Applicant and is currently quite ill.  One of his three sisters is a naturalized\nU.S. citizen residing in the U.S.  His brother (while not yet naturalized as a U.S. citizen)\nresides in the U.S.  His two other sisters (both citizens of Pakistan) reside in Pakistan and\nIndia, respectively. \nApplicant and his family have deep roots in Pakistan, a country rich in history and\nsocio/political traditions.  Pakistan also has a checkered history with authoritarian\ngovernment, poor human rights, cross-border terrorist activity, and some nuclear\ntechnology exchanges with active and potential adversaries of the U.S.  Despite\nencouraging efforts in the development of strategic partnerships between Pakistan and\nthe U.S. in recent years, there have been cited instances of serious human rights abuses,\nthe weakening of legal and judicial safeguards, cross-border terrorist attacks on U.S.\n\n10\nforces operating in Afghanistan by terrorist groups from the tribal areas, and potentially\nharmful exchanges of nuclear technology. \nThe Government urges security concerns over risks that Applicant\u2019s mother,\nsiblings/spouses residing in Pakistan, and cited friend (of a Pakistani VIP) might be\nsubject to undue foreign influence by Pakistani government authorities to access\nclassified information in Applicant\u2019s possession or control.  Because Applicant and his\nimmediate family members who have Pakistani citizenship by birth and reside currently in\nPakistan, or have close connections with high-ranking political officials in Pakistan (like\nApplicant\u2019s college friend\u2019s father), they present potential heightened security risks\ncovered by disqualifying condition  (DC) \u00b6 7(a), \u201ccontact with a foreign family member,\nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident\nin a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation,\ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion,\u201d of the AG guidelines for foreign\ninfluence. The citizenship/residence status of two of his sisters (one residing in Pakistan\nand the other in India) pose some potential concerns for Applicant because of the risks of\nundue foreign influence that could compromise sensitive or classified information under\nApplicant's possession and/or control. \nTo be sure, none of Applicant\u2019s family members have any identified prior military or\ngovernment service. However, his identified college friend\u2019s father clearly does.\nConsequently, some consideration of DC \u00b6 7(b), \u201cconnection to a foreign person, group,\ngovernment, or country that create a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s\nobligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help\na foreign person, group, or country by providing that information,\u201d is warranted. Applicant,\nhowever, has maintained only occasional contract with A (to include his social visit to\nPakistan in 2003), has no Pakistani passport, and has no plans to travel to Pakistan in the\nforeseeable future.\nFrom what is known from the presented evidence, none of Applicant\u2019s immediate\nfamily residing in Pakistan have any political affiliations with the Pakistani  government or\nmilitary establishments.  Nor do they have any history to date of being subjected to any\ncoercion or influence, or appear to be vulnerable to the same. \nThe citizenship status and presence in Pakistan of one of Applicant\u2019s siblings\nposes some risk because of the political and economic uncertainty that exists in Pakistan,\ndespite the strong government-to-government relationship between the U.S. and\nPakistan.  Ths risks are manageable, though, and reconcilable with U.S. security\ninterests.  Applicant\u2019s contacts with his family members and college friend are infrequent\n(no more than a couple of times a year).  Applicant had demonstrated strong loyalties to\nthe U.S. and manifest commitments to protect this country\u2019s security interests and resist\nany family pressures that could weaken his fiducial duties to protecting classified\ninformation.  Applicant\u2019s own commitments are reinforced by Pakistan\u2019s strong strategic\npartnership with the U.S. on the war on terrorism and emergent signs of becoming a fully\nsuccessful constitutional democracy. This abiding strategic relationship makes it much\n\n11\nless likely that it would use its government and military resources to pressure any relative\nof Applicant to as a means of acquiring U.S. secrets. \nThe Adjudicative Guidelines governing collateral clearances do not dictate per se\nresults or mandate particular outcomes for applicants with relatives who are\ncitizens/residents of foreign countries in general.  What is considered to be an acceptable\nrisk in one foreign country may not be in another.  While foreign influence cases must by\npractical necessity be weighed on a case-by-case basis, guidelines are available for\nreferencing in the supplied materials and country information about Pakistan. \nThe new AGs do take into account the  country\u2019s demonstrated relations with the\nU.S. as an important consideration in gauging whether the particular relatives with\ncitizenship and residency elsewhere create a heightened security risk. The geopolitical\naims and policies of the particular foreign regime involved do matter. \nAs historically demonstrated, Pakistan has long been known to be a country with\nfriendly ties to the U.S.  While the reports of cross-border strikes, human rights abuses,\nand nuclear technology exchanges have been a matter of some security concern to the\nU.S., Pakistan\u2019s emergent status as a strategic partner of the U.S. in battling terrorist\nelements operating in the Afghanistan/Pakistan border regions is an important political\ndevelopment that serves to promote political solidarity, and reduce security risks and\nconcerns between the two nuclear powers.\nBased on his case-specific circumstances, MC \u00b6 8(a), \u201cthe nature of the\nrelationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are located, or the\npersons or activities of these persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the\nindividual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of a\nforeign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S.\u201d  is\nsomewhat applicable to Applicant.  Neither Applicant, his college friend, nor his\nimmediate family residing in Pakistan are in any way connected to the Pakistan\ngovernment or military and pose no likelihood of being pressured, compromised, or\ninfluenced.   Further, in the hypothetical situation where any of his family members were\nto be pressured, Applicant\u2019s strong loyalties and security commitments to the U.S. make it\nvery unlikely that he would permit himself to be pressured into compromising classified\ninformation. \nOf benefit to Applicant, too, is MC 8(b), \u201cthere is no conflict of interest, either\nbecause the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group,\ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding\nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any\nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d Applicant\u2019s demonstrated loyalty,\npatriotism, and professional commitments to the U.S., are well demonstrated and enough\nunder these circumstances to neutralize all potential conflicts that are implicit in his\nrelationships with his immediate family members and college. \n\n12\nMC \u00b6 8(c), \u201ccontact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and\ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create risk for foreign influence or\nexploitation,\u201d has some applicability, too, based on Applicant own infrequent contacts with\nhis family members residing in Pakistan and college friend (and son of a former Pakistan\npresident).  Applicant\u2019s contacts with his sisters are infrequent (once or twice a year). His\ncontacts with A have been minimal, too, since he (Applicant) became a naturalized U.S.\ncitizen. His social visit with A in 2003 in Pakistan in 2003 is exceptional, and not likely to\nbe repeated.\nOne other mitigating condition has mixed application to Applicant\u2019s situation.  MC \u00b6\n8(e), \u201cthe individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements regarding\nthe reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, groups, or organizations from\na foreign country,\u201d has some prospective value.  Albeit, there is really no documented\nrecord of Applicant\u2019s prior reporting of his contacts with members of his family and friend,\nrespectively, to warrant any more than minimal consideration at this time. \nWhole person assessment is available also to minimize Applicant\u2019s exposure to\nconflicts of interests with his Pakistani family members.  Most importantly, Applicant is not\naware of any risks of coercion, pressure, or influence that any of his family members of\nfriend (A) might be exposed to. So, in Applicant\u2019s case, the potential risk of coercion,\npressure, or influence being brought to bear on him and his identified friend is minimal\nand mitigated. \nOverall, any potential security concerns attributable to Applicant's relations with\nfamily members residing in Pakistan and the U.S., are sufficiently mitigated to permit safe\npredictive judgments about Applicant's ability to withstand risks of undue influence\nattributable to his familial relationships in Pakistan.  Both his own longstanding residence\nand citizenship in the U.S., and those of his wife and most of his immediate family in the\nU.S., and his demonstrated loyalties and commitments to protecting U.S. security\ninterests, make it highly unlikely he would succumb to any foreign influence brought to\nbear on himself or his family members by Pakistani government or military officials.\nFavorable conclusions warrant with respect to the allegations covered by Guideline B.\nIn reaching my recommended decision, I have considered the evidence as a\nwhole, including each of the factors and conditions enumerated in E2.2.2 of the\nAdjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive.\nFormal Findings\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR in the context of the findings of fact,\nconclusions, and the factors and conditions listed above, I make the following separate\nformal findings with respect to Applicant's eligibility for a security clearance.\nGUIDELINE B: (FOREIGN INFLUENCE):\nFOR APPLICANT\n\n13\nSub-paras 1.a through 1.g:\nFOR APPLICANT\nConclusions\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant's security clearance. \nClearance is granted.\n                                  \nRoger C.

He works for a defense\ncontractor as a security camera technician.  He had 17 delinquent debts totaling about $28,000 listed\nin the SOR.  He has a repayment plan for five debts, and owes $5,752 on the remaining twelve debts.\nApplicant answered the delinquent debt question on his trustworthiness applicant truthfully.\nApplicant mitigated the financial considerations and personal conduct trustworthiness concerns.\nEligibility for a public trust position is granted.\n\nAdjudication of trustworthiness cases for ADP I, II, and III positions are resolved using the provisions of DoD\n1\nDirective 5220.6 (Directive), pursuant to the memorandum from Carol A. Haave, Deputy Under Secretary of Defense\nfor Counterintelligence and Security to DOHA Director, Adjudication of Trustworthiness Cases (Nov. 19, 2004).\nPursuant to Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended\n2\nand modified, and the Directive.\n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a\nposition of trust for Applicant .  On January 17, 2007, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons  (SOR)\n1\n2\ndetailing the basis for its decision\u2013trustworthiness concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines of the\nDirective issued on December 29, 2005, and implemented by the Department of Defense, effective\nSeptember 1, 2006.  Applicant answered the SOR in writing on March 16, 2007, and elected to have\na hearing before an administrative judge.  The case was assigned to me on June 14, 2007.  On\nSeptember 18, 2007, I convened a hearing to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a trustworthiness determination for Applicant.  The Government\nand the Applicant submitted exhibits that were admitted into evidence.  DOHA received the hearing\ntranscript (Tr.) on September 27, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant's admissions to all of the SOR allegations are incorporated as findings of fact.\nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and full consideration of that\nevidence, I make the following additional findings of fact:\nApplicant is 52 years old, and was divorced after 25 years of marriage in 2004, and the father\nof three adult children.  He works as security camera contractor for a Government contractor.  He\nearns $3,040 before taxes each month, and takes home about $1,000 twice monthly.  His monthly\nexpenses total about $1,800.  He rents an apartment.  He was unemployed from the summer of 2004\nto the spring of 2005.  During that time, he paid his bills and bought necessities with his credit cards.\nAfter his divorce, he did not keep track of his debts, and allowed friends or acquaintances to use his\nchecking account and have access to his credit cards.  He stopped allowing those people access some\ntime ago, and now has no credit cards and a small savings account. (Tr. 15-19, 28-31, 40, 41, 46, 48;\nExhibit 1)\nApplicant has 17 delinquent debts, totaling about $28,000.  The debts listed in the SOR\nbecame delinquent and in write-off status in December 2004 to February 2005.  Some of the credit\ncard debt was incurred during his marriage, and he was obligated in the divorce judgment to pay it.\nIn 2005 and 2006, for a period of six months, he worked with a credit counseling agency to try to\npay his delinquent debts.  He paid $300 to $500 monthly for about six months while being counseled\nthrough that agency\u2019s program.  When his car stopped working, he ceased going to the credit\ncounseling agency.  He started to work directly with his creditors.  The only repayment plan for all\nhis delinquent debts he has involves paying the largest debt first which has the most demanding\ncollector.  Then, he would repay the other creditors in the order of the largest balance next, and so\n\n3\non down the creditor list.  Applicant has settled about $22,000 of his $28,000 in delinquent debt.\nHe is comfortable financially paying $400 monthly toward his debts.  At one time he was paying\n$700 monthly on a debt, but that amount put a burden on him financially.  His current monthly bills\nare paid on time and in full.  Applicant admits his responsibility for his debts. (Tr. 28, 29, 35, 43-46,\n48, 49, 51, 52; Exhibits 2-5)\nApplicant paid or is negotiating to pay five delinquent debts listed in the SOR in the\nfollowing manner:\nA credit card debt for $7,768 (SOR Para. 1.a), another credit card debt owed\nto the same bank for $2,820 (SOR Para. 1.b.), and a department store credit card\nissued by the same bank with a debt of $1,404 (SOR Para. 1.o.) settled for $6,000.\nHe has not started repaying the settlement amount because he has not finalized it, and\nhe has to repay the settlement for the credit card debt in Para. 1.i. first. (Tr. 23-25, 49-\n52; Exhibit A)\nAnother credit card debt owed to a bank is $2,703 (SOR Para. 1.c.).\nApplicant paid this debt in a settlement for $2,000, payable in installments of $667\nover three months from June to August 2007. (Tr. 25, 26; Exhibit C)\nApplicant owes a bank $7,768 on a credit card debt (SOR Para. 1.i).  He\nnegotiated a $3,000 settlement.  He is paying $400 monthly from September 2007,\nfor eight months.  He paid previously a $2,000 debt, and can now use the money he\npaid on that debt to repay this debt. (Tr. 20-24; Exhibit B)\nApplicant has not paid the remaining 12 delinquent debts totaling $5,752.  As he pays off one\ndebt, he plans to pay the remaining debts in descending order according to the size of the debt.\nApplicant can comfortably repay $400 monthly on one or more debts, but not more, based on his\nincome. (Tr. 28, 45, 49-52; Exhibits 2-5)\nApplicant completed his public trustworthiness position application, a Standard Form 85P,\non March 23, 2005.  In answer to Question 20 (Are you now over 180 days delinquent on any loan\nor financial obligation?), Applicant answered \u201cno.\u201d  Applicant explained his answer by admitting\nhe had not kept track of his debts after his divorce, \u201cfor a couple of years I\u2019ve kind of let things go.\nMaybe really didn\u2019t care.  That\u2019s no excuse.\u201d  Applicant knew he had some debts past due, but did\nnot think any were older than 180 days delinquent.  None of the debts listed on the credit reports that\nare also listed in the SOR are older than six months delinquent.  All delinquencies were reported on\nor after September 2004, the 180 day commencement period. (Tr. 29, 40; Exhibits 1-4)\nPOLICIES\nAs Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information\nbearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to\noccupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d Department of the Navy\nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 527 (1988).  The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his\ndesignee to grant applicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that\n\n4\nit is clearly consistent the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation with Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960).  By direction of the Under Secretary of Defense for\nCounterintelligence and Security, adjudications of cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense\nSecurity Service or the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) for a trustworthiness determination\nshall be conducted under the provisions of the Directive.  Eligibility for a position of trust is\npredicated upon the applicant meeting the guidelines contained in the Directive and a finding it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so. See Directive \u00b6 2.3.  An applicant \u201chas the\nultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or\ncontinue his trustworthiness determination.\u201d See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15\nThe adjudication process is based on the whole person concept.  Enclosure 2 of the Directive\nsets forth personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating\nconditions (MC) under each guideline that must be carefully considered in making the overall\ncommon sense determination required.  The decision to deny an individual eligibility to occupy a\nposition of trust is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  See Exec. Or.\n10865 \u00a7 7.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President\nand the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a such a determination.\nIn evaluating the trustworthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess\nthe adjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6 6.3 of the Directive and the revised Guidelines effective\nSeptember 1, 2006.  Those assessments include:  (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the\nconduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, and the extent of knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) how recent and frequent the behavior was; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity\nat the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the\npotential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence (See revised Guidelines \u00b62.a., effective September 1, 2006).  Because each case presents\nits own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that the factors exhaust the realm\nof human experience or that the factors apply equally in every case.  Moreover, although adverse\ninformation concerning a single condition may not be sufficient for an unfavorable determination,\nthe individual may be disqualified if available information reflects a recent or recurring pattern of\nquestionable judgment, irresponsibility, or other behavior specified in the Guidelines.\nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal\nor professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being\neligible to occupy a position of trust.  The Directive presumes a nexus or rational connection\nbetween proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an\napplicant\u2019s trustworthiness suitability.  See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).\nAll that is required is proof of facts and circumstances that indicate an applicant is at risk for\nmishandling classified information, or that an applicant does not demonstrate the high degree of\njudgment, reliability, or trustworthiness required of persons handling classified information.  ISCR\nCase No. 00-0277, 2001 DOHA LEXIS 335 at **6-8 (App. Bd. 2001).  Once the Government has\nestablished a prima facie case by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut,\nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate\nburden of demonstrating that is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his\ntrustworthiness determination. ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. 2002).  \u201cAny doubt as to\n\n5\nwhether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved\nin favor of the national security.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E2.2.2\nBased upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative\nguidelines most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:\nGuideline F: Financial Considerations: The Concern: Failure or inability to live within\none\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which could raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  An individual\nwho is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nCompulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes including espionage.  Affluence\nthat cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a security concern.  It may indicate\nproceeds from financially profitable criminal acts. \u00b618\nGuideline E: Personal Conduct: The Concern: Conduct involving questionable judgment,\nlack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  Of\nspecial interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance\nprocess or any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \u00b615\n\u201cThe standard that must be met for . . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all\navailable information, the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that  . . .\nassigning the person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d\n(Regulation \u00b6C6.1.1.1)  The revised Guidelines, effective September 1, 2006, set forth the\nadjudicative policy, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC)\nassociated with each guideline.  DoD contractor personnel are afforded the adjudication procedures\ncontained in the Directive. (\u00b61 of the revised Guidelines, effective September 1, 2006)\nCONCLUSIONS\nGuideline F: Applicant incurred about $28,000 in delinquent debt in 2004 and 2005.  He\nhad to repay some debt from his 25-year marriage, and incurred additional debt after the 2004\ndivorce when he was unemployed for several months.  During that time, he used his credit cards to\nfinance his living necessities.  The Disqualifying Conditions (DC) that apply are \u00b619.a. (inability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts), and \u00b619.c. (a history of not meeting financial obligations).\nHowever, Applicant\u2019s financial situation was aggravated by the divorce and his subsequent\nunemployment.  Now he has a repayment plan, has repaid two debts, is in the midst of a repayment\nplan on another settlement agreement, and is finalizing another settlement plan, which he will start\nrepaying in about eight months.  Applicant consulted a credit counseling agency for six months and\nwas repaying some his debts through that process.  Then he negotiated with his creditors directly,\nand developed a repayment plan.  His plan is to pay $400 monthly to creditors, starting with the\nlargest debts first.  As a result of his plan, he has repaid or has settlement agreements being executed\nor is in negotiations for about $22,000 of his delinquent debt.  His unpaid smaller delinquent debt,\ntotal $5,752.  The Mitigating Conditions (MC) which apply are \u00b620.b (the conditions that resulted\n\n6\nin the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances), \u00b620.c. (the person has received or is receiving\ncounseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or\nis under control), and \u00b620.d (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors\nor otherwise resolve debts).\nGuideline E: Applicant did not disclose any 180 day delinquent debts on his public position\ntrustworthiness application in 2005, because he did not realize he had any delinquent debts older\nthan 180 days.  He had delinquent debts listed in the SOR which were written off after September\n2004, as shown on Exhibits 2-4.  The fact that no debt was reported delinquent prior to September\n2004, coupled with the forthright and frank manner in which Applicant acknowledged his\nresponsibility to repay his debts, and his denial of any intentional falsification, show no DC apply\nin this case because Applicant did not deliberately falsify his answer to Question 20.  His credibility\nand honesty, coupled with the facts on the credit reports, show his truthfulness in answering\nQuestion 20.\nWhole Person Analysis:  \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period\nof a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is.\" eligible for a\ntrustworthiness decision.  (Revised Guidelines \u00b62.a.)  \"Eligibility for access to classified information\nis predicated upon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudication\nprocess is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept.\nAvailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should\nbe considered in reaching a determination.\u201d  In evaluating Applicant\u2019s case, I have considered the\nadjudicative factors listed in the revised Guidelines, effective September 1, 2006, contained in \u00b62.a.\nI considered all the variables regarding his debt problems.  Applicant spent more money than\nhe earned, but some of the debts arose during his 25-year marriage and he became responsible for\nthem after his divorce.  I considered the size of the debts, their nature, and extent of the amount.  I\nalso considered the circumstances of his divorce and subsequent unemployment.  He has not incurred\nany recent debt he cannot repay on a monthly basis, and is working to repay all these debts.  His\nefforts resulted in a plan to settle about $22,000 of his debt, leaving him with $5,752 to repay over\nthe next few years.  His participation in accumulating the debt was voluntary, but circumstances also\ncontributed to some of his debt problems.  He sought credit counseling to help repay his debt.  Based\non his acceptance of responsibility for the debts, and his efforts to repay these debts, I do not find\na potential for coercion, pressure, exploitation, or duress, nor a likelihood the past spending pattern\nwill recur, in part because Applicant has no credit cards presently.\nThese same variables need not be considered regarding the personal conduct allegations in\nthe SOR.  Applicant told the truth on his application form, and the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d is\nsatisfied by that fact.\nTherefore, I conclude the financial considerations trustworthiness concern for Applicant.  I\nconclude the personal conduct trustworthiness concern for Applicant.  I also conclude the \u201cwhole\nperson concept\u201d for Applicant. \n\n7\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.  Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a to 1.q:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2.  Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for assignment to sensitive duties.  His\napplication for eligibility for a public trust position is granted.\nPhilip S. Howe\nAdministrative Judge\n",

The Defense Office of Hearings\nand Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  As required\nby Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended,\nand Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance\nReview Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on\nOctober 23, 2006, detailing the basis for its decision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline H\n(Drug Involvement) of the Directive.  The President issued revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) on\nDecember 30, 2005.  DoD implemented them on September 1, 2006.  Pending official\namendment/reissue of DoD Directive 5220.6, the AG are to be used in all cases when the SOR was\nissued on or after September 1, 2006.  Because the SOR was issued after September 1, 2006, this\ncase proceeds under the revised guidelines. \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on November 3, 2006, and elected to have a hearing\nbefore an administrative judge.  The case was assigned to another administrative judge on January\n10, 2007.  It was transferred to me  January 2, 2007, due to scheduling considerations.  A Notice of\nHearing was dated on February 16, 2007.  I convened a hearing on March 9, 2007, to consider\nwhether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant's  security\nclearance.  The government offered four exhibits, marked as Exhibits 1-4.  Applicant offered ten\nexhibits, marked as Exhibits A-J.  All exhibits were admitted without objection.   DOHA received\nthe transcript (Tr.) on March 19, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant denied the allegations contained in the SOR.  After a complete and thorough\nreview of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following\nadditional findings of fact: \nApplicant is a 36-year-old senior computer scientist and technical architect employed by a\nfederal contractor.

He\n5\nstopped all illegal drug use in August 2004.    \n6\nPrior to working for a government contractor, Applicant worked as a contractor for a large\nbrokerage company.  He was away from home a lot, with long work hours.  That lifestyle was\ncharacterized as \u201cwork hard, play hard\u201d, and there was a lot of drug usage around him.   Today, he\n7\nand his wife are thinking about having children, his friends do not use drugs, and he lives a totally\ndifferent lifestyle because he is not traveling with his job, and they do not associate with people who\nuse drugs..8\nAn American foreign services officer testified that he and Applicant attended college\ntogether.  He believed that Applicant was one of the more talented, determined, and fiercely loyal\npeople that he has known.  He believes Applicant is a patriot, and that his loyalty to the United States\nis absolute.  He related a very emotional time for Applicant, while in college.  His girlfriend broke\nup  with him, and a sister, mother and father passed away within a short period of time.  About five\nyears ago, Applicant told him about his drug usage.   This friend then had a frank discussion with\n9\nhim about the necessity to clean up his act, especially if he wanted a job that required a security\nclearance.  The only time Applicant used drugs in his presence was at a party in college and since\nthat time he has never seen Applicant use drugs.  \nAnother acquaintance had hired Applicant when he graduated from college, and over the past\ntwo years has worked with him on a daily basis.  He trusts Applicant and said that if Applicant had\ntold him that he had not used drugs in number of years, he would believe him.   Next, a managing\n10\neditor of a publication, who went to college with Applicant and has known him for 14 years testified.\nHe sees Applicant socially once or twice per month.  Applicant has always been forthright about his\nuse of drugs and also forthright about the fact that he no longer wants drugs as a part of his life.  He\nhas great confidence in Applicant\u2019s honesty, that he possesses high character, and is somebody  who\nacts with respect and forthrightness in everything he does.  He dated Applicant\u2019s wife when they\nwere in college, and stated she started dating Applicant around 2000, and married him in 2005.11\nApplicant\u2019s supervisor, a senior program manager, hired Applicant, and works with him\ndaily.  The supervisor has held a security clearance since 1965.  He related how Applicant had been\nselected as the outstanding new employee his first year on the job.   Applicant disclosed his drug\n12\n\nId. at 42.\n13\nId. at 40-44.\n14\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit B (Letter of Recommendation, undated) at 1.\n15\n \nGuidelines \u00b6 2(c).\n16\n5\nuse when his supervisor told him he was recommending him for a security clearance.   He stated,\n13\n\u201cI think he\u2019s an absolute first rate employee.  He has demonstrated to me on numerous occasions that\nhe is honest, fully integrated in terms of his personal relationships with other people, and a decent\nand honorable man.  I would have no qualms or reservations about issuing a top secret clearance to\nApplicant.  I would trust him with custody of my most personal information.\u201d14\nApplicant\u2019s wife talks about her husband\u2019s dedication to his job.  In her letter of\nrecommendation, she noted \u201chis openness and honesty are key components to his success; he doesn\u2019t\npromise what he cannot deliver, and he will give everything he has to produce results.  He has\nconsistently been a trusted resource, fully dedicated to his clients and employers.\u201d  \n15\nPOLICIES\nIn an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s security suitability, an administrative judge must consider\nthe \u201cAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified Information\u201d\n(Guidelines).  In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines are\ndivided into disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used to determine an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law.  Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, an administrative judge should apply these guidelines in\nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. Guidelines \u00b6 2.  An administrative\njudge\u2019s over arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision.  Because the\nentire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person\nconcept,\u201d an administrative judge should consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.16\nSpecifically, an administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors\nlisted at Guidelines \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency\nand recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5)\nextent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nSince the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision\nin each case is arrived at by applying the standard that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being\n\nGuidelines \u00b6 2(b).\n17\n\u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might  accept as adequate to support a\n18\nconclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006)\n(citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1).  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing\ntwo inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial\nevidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966).  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a\nscintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4  Cir. 1994).\nth\nSee ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  The Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence\n19\n \nas a whole, both favorable and unfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent\nprovisions of the Directive, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.15.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006). \nExecutive Order 10865, \u00a7 7. \n20\n6\nconsidered for access to classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d   In\n17\nreaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based\non the evidence contained in the record.  Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on\nmere speculation or conjecture.\nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d   The\n18\ngovernment initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a case which demonstrates,\nin accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nor continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information.  Once the government has produced\nsubstantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, the burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence\nand prove a mitigating condition.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 provides, \u201cThe applicant is responsible for\npresenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by\napplicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] has the ultimate burden of persuasion\nas to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  The burden of disproving a mitigating condition\nnever shifts to the government.19\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with\nthe government predicated upon trust and confidence.  It is a relationship that transcends normal duty\nhours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well.  It is because of this special relationship the\ngovernment must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to\nwhom it grants access to classified information.  Decisions under this Directive and the guidelines\ninclude, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information.  Such decisions entail a certain\ndegree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nThe scope of an administrative judge\u2019s decision is limited.  Nothing in this decision should\nbe construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied\ndetermination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.  \n20\n\n7\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe concern about the use of illegal drugs is found in Guidelines \u00b6 24. The Concern. Use of\nan illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions about an individual's reliability\nand trustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and because it raises questions about a\nperson's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\n(a) Drugs are defined as mood and behavior altering substances, and include:\n(1) Drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and listed in the\nControlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., marijuana or cannabis, depressants, narcotics,\nstimulants, and hallucinogens), and\n(2) inhalants and other similar substances.\n(b) drug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner that deviates from\napproved medical direction.\nGuidelines \u00b6 25. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying\ninclude:\n(a) any drug abuse (see above definition); and\nc) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or\ndistribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia.\nApplicant admitted his drug use and purchase from 1992 to 2004.  The government\nestablished its case under Guideline \u00b6 25(a) and (c). \nGuidelines \u00b6 26. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:\n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;\n(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;\n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \n(3) an appropriate period of abstinence; or\n(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for any      \nviolation.\nApplicant has been drug free for nearly three years.  The Directive does not define \u201crecent.\u201d\nIn ISCR Case No. 04-12648 at 9 (App. Bd.  Oct. 20, 2006), the Appeal Board:\ndeclined to set any \"bright-line\" rule as to what constitutes \"recent\" under the\nDirective regarding illegal drug use.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-10454 (November\n\nISCR Case No. 03- 02374 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 26, 11 2006) (Judge did not err by concluding drug use not recent with\n21\npassage of slightly less than two and a half years between last use and hearing) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-10454 at 4\n(App. Bd. Nov. 23, 2004)).  See ISCR Case No. 98-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 1, 1999) (not error for Judge to find that\nlast marijuana use nine months before close of record was not recent).\nDirective \u00b6 E.2.2.1.\n22\nId.\n23\nId.\n24\n8\n23, 2004) at p. 4.  The Board has indicated the matter requires an Administrative\nJudge to evaluate the record evidence as a whole and reach a reasonable conclusion\nas to the recency of an applicant's conduct.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-22173 (May\n26, 2004) at p. 4.  The application of a mitigating condition like Guideline H\nMitigating Condition 1 can depend upon a number of factors in addition to the simple\npassage of time.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 98-0611 (November 1, 1999) at p. 2.  The\ninterval of time presented in this case, slightly less than two and a half years, must\nbe evaluated in light of other factors in the case.21\nApplicant\u2019s lifestyle has changed.  He is now a family man, planning to have children, and he has\nbeen given significant responsibilities by his employer.  His friends have changed.  His long-standing\nfriends and his coworkers and supervised believe he is a changed person.  His wife thinks he is a\ndifferent person.  All of these factors work together to convince me  that his drug use is not recent,\nand support his stated intent not to use drugs in the future.  He has made the changes necessary in\nhis life to mitigate his prior drug involvement.  I conclude guideline H for Applicant.\nWhole Person Analysis\n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.\u201d   \u201cAvailable,\n22\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be\nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u201d   In addition to the disqualifying and mitigating conditions,\n23\nI  considered the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept in evaluating Applicant\u2019s risk and vulnerability in\nprotecting our national interests.   I considered his age (36), his education, his employment, and\n24\nwhat might motivate him to stop his drug abuse.  Candor with the government about a person\u2019s\nnegatives is important in a trustworthiness determination.  If a person discloses the adverse\ninformation about himself, he may be more likely to put the governments\u2019s interests ahead of his\nown to protect classified information.  Applicant was completely truthful about his drug use,\ndisclosing it on his security clearance application and admitting his usage in his testimony.\nThe illegal use of drugs raises questions regarding an individual\u2019s willingness or ability to\nprotect classified information.  Moreover, impaired ability while under the influence of illegal drugs\nincreases the risk of an unauthorized disclosure of classified material.  His drug use extended over\na twelve-year period.  Applicant\u2019s motivation to use drugs was peer pressure and a desire to be\nsociable.  He worked away from home and worked long hours.  Drug use was a way that he and\ncoworkers relieved stress.  In the last three years, Applicant has made significant changes in his life.\nHe married in 2005.  He discontinued use of marijuana in 2004.  He no longer works for a high-\npressure brokerage firm.  He doesn\u2019t work out of town.  His competence and commitment to his\n\n9\ncurrent employer won him new employee honors..  Applicant is now 36 and is a more mature\ndecision-maker.  He stated an intent not to use drugs in the future. \nI have carefully weighed the mitigating factors, the totality of the circumstances surrounding\nhis decision to use drugs until 2004, his honesty in revealing this information, his work ethic, his\nrecent conduct, and his change in attitude against the seriousness of his misconduct.  I have\nconcluded that he would not act in a manner which would harm the government.  There is little\nlikelihood he could be pressured, coerced, exploited, or subjected to duress for his past conduct.  I\nobserved Applicant during the hearing, and especially during his testimony.  I found him to be a\nsincere and credible witness, because he answered questions directly, completely, and honestly.  I\nbelieve Applicant will remain drug free in the future.  He has overcome the reasonable  doubts about\nhis willingness and ability to protect classified information, and to exercise the requisite good\njudgment and discretion expected of one in whom the government entrusts its interests.  I conclude\nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1. Guideline H:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

Gomez, Esquire, Applicant\u2019s Counsel\n\n2\nSYNOPSIS\nThe Applicant\u2019s last alcohol related incident, having 08% or more by weight of alcohol in\nhis blood while driving a motor vehicle (DUI), occurred nearly three years ago, in May of 2004.  He\nnow drinks alcohol only about \u201conce a month,\u201d and never to the point of intoxication.  Furthermore,\na certified Substance Abuse Counselor avers that the Applicant is not now \u201cor has ever been alcohol\ndependent.\u201d  He also has the unqualified support of his supervisors and colleagues.  This last\nincident, plus a September 2001 alcohol related incident involving Public Intoxication, \u201cdoes not\ncast doubt on the . . . [Applicant\u2019s] current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgement.\u201d\nMitigation is shown.  Clearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn October 16, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2,\n1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed the reasons why DOHA\ncould not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and\nrecommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied\nor revoked.\nApplicant filed an Answer to the SOR on December 11, 2006.\nThe case was received by the undersigned on February 2, 2007.  A notice of hearing was\nissued on February 15, 2007, and the case was heard on March 13, 2007.  The Government\nsubmitted documentary evidence.  Testimony was taken from the Applicant, who also submitted\ndocumentary evidence.  The transcript (TR) was received on March 23, 2007.  The issues raised here\nare whether the Applicant's past Alcohol Consumption militates against the granting of a security\nclearance.  [The Applicant admits subparagraphs 1.b. and 1.c.; but denies any excessive alcohol\nconsumption subsequent to his May 2004 DUI arrest, which is alleged in subparagraph 1.a.]\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the documents\nand the live testimony.  The Applicant is 36 years of age, and is employed by a defense contractor\nwho seeks a security clearance on behalf of the Applicant.  After a complete and thorough review\nof the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the same, I make the following\nadditional Findings of Fact.\nGuideline G - Alcohol Consumption\n1.a.  The Applicant started to consume alcohol in about 1987, his senior year in high school\n(TR at page 19 lines 19~21).  This underage drinking continued through college, when he would\ndrink \u201conce or twice a week, on weekends or maybe at a party\u201d (TR at page 20 lines 15~20).  The\nApplicant\u2019s \u201cdrinking habits slowed down in the 90's.  Right after college, . . . [he] got married and\n\n3\n. . . was working a full-time job\u201d (TR at page 21 lines 14~22).  He drank alcohol \u201c[m]aybe twice a\nmonth\u201d (Id).  He drank to the point of intoxication about \u201conce a year\u201d (TR at page 22 lines 11~16).\n1.b.  In September of 2001, the Applicant was arrested and subsequently charged with Public\nIntoxication (Government Exhibit (GX) 1 at page 7).  He went to a concert, had a few beers, he and\nhis \u201cgroup . . . started getting fairly rowdy,\u201d which resulted in his arrest (TR at page 23 line 14 to\npage 24 line 4).  The Applicant was fined, and placed on probation for six months (TR at page 24\nline 20 to page 25 line 7).\n1.c.  In May of 2004, the Applicant was arrested and subsequently pled Nolo Contendere to\na DUI (GX 2).  He was at a \u201cMemorial Day weekend . . . party with co-workers,\u201d and had too many\n\u201crum and cokes\u201d to drink (TR at page 25 line 19 to page 26 line 20).  He was pulled over by the\n\u201cHighway Patrol\u201d (Id).  He was fined about $1,400, ordered to attend six Alcoholics Anonymous\nmeetings, and placed on probation for 36 months (GX 2).  As a result of this DUI incident, the\nApplicant changed his lifestyle (TR at page 27 lines 19~24).  He no longer socializes with those\nfriends, and he only consumes alcohol about \u201conce a month,\u201d and then not to the point of\nintoxication (TR at page 27 line 19 to page 33 line 5).\nMitigation\nA certified Substance Abuse Counselor avers that the Applicant is not now \u201cor has ever been\nalcohol dependent\u201d (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AppX) G).\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the 1992 Directive set forth both policy factors and\nconditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern.  Furthermore, as set forth in the Directive,\neach clearance decision must be a fair and impartial common sense determination based upon\nconsideration of all the relevant and material information and the pertinent criteria and adjudication\npolicy in Enclosure 2, including as appropriate:\na. Nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct, and surrounding\ncircumstances.\nb. Frequency and recency of the conduct.\nc. Age and maturity of the applicant.\nd. Motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct\nwas negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of\nthe consequence involved.\ne. Absence or presence of rehabilitation.\nf. Probability that circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in\nthe future.\n\n4\nThe Administrative Judge, however, can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have\na reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or\nconclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.\nThe Government must make out a case under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption) which\nestablishes doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.  While a rational\nconnection, or nexus, must be shown between an applicant's adverse conduct and his ability to\neffectively safeguard classified information, with respect to sufficiency of proof of a rational\nconnection, objective or direct evidence is not required.\nThen, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in refutation,\nexplanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past adverse conduct is unlikely\nto be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for a security clearance.\nThe Government must be able to place a high degree of confidence in a security clearance\nholder to abide by all security rules and regulations at all times and in all places.  If an applicant has\ndemonstrated a lack of respect for the law in his private affairs, there then exists the possibility that\nan applicant may demonstrate the same attitude towards security rules and regulations.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe Applicant\u2019s admitted Alcohol Consumption is evidenced by two alcohol related\nconvictions, one in 2001 for Public Intoxication, and the last one for DUI in May of 2004.  The first\ndisqualifying condition under Alcohol Consumption is therefore applicable he has had \u201calcohol-\nrelated incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence, . . . disturbing the\npeace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol\nabuser or alcohol dependent.\u201d  However, this is countered the first mitigating condition as \u201cso much\ntime has passed [nearly three years] . . . that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d\nFurthermore, I am not limited to the mitigating conditions, delineated in the Directive, in\ndeciding if an Applicant has demonstrated extenuation or mitigation.  Here, his supervisors and\ncolleagues speak most highly of his character, credibility and trustworthiness (AppXs A~F).  The\ntotality of the Applicant\u2019s conduct and circumstances, as set forth at length above, clearly warrants\na favorable Decision under the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d  Mitigation is shown.  Guideline G is found\nfor the Applicant.\nConsidering all the evidence, the Applicant has rebutted the Government's case regarding his\nAlcohol Consumption.  The Applicant has thus met the mitigating conditions of Guideline G, and\nof Section E.2.2. of the Directive.  Accordingly, he has  met his ultimate burden of persuasion under\nGuideline G.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings required by paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\n\n5\nParagraph 1:\nFOR THE APPLICANT\na. For the Applicant.\nb. For the Applicant.\nc. For the Applicant.\nFactual support and reasons for the foregoing are set forth in FINDINGS OF FACT and\nCONCLUSIONS, supra.\nDECISION\nIn light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.\nRichard A. Cefola\nAdministrative Judge\n",

The Judge properly concluded that this was an administrative error.  Tr. at 7-8.  She\ntreated the case as an application for a trustworthiness designation, and her decision styles the case number with an ADP\nprefix. \n \n2\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a\ntrustworthiness designation.   On August 29, 2006, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR)\n1\nadvising Applicant of the basis for that decision\u2013trustworthiness concerns raised under Guideline\nF (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On May\n31, 2007, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Jacqueline T. Williams granted Applicant\u2019s request\nfor a trustworthiness designation.  Department Counsel filed a timely appeal pursuant to Directive\n\u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nDepartment Counsel raises the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s application\nof the Financial Consideration Mitigating Conditions (FCMC) is error; whether the Judge\u2019s\nconclusion that the government had not met its burden of production under Guideline E is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law; and whether the Judge\u2019s whole person-analysis is supported by record\nevidence.  Finding error we reverse.\nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Factual Findings\nA.  Facts\nApplicant is a budget analyst for a defense contractor.  She currently holds a secret clearance.\nIn 1996 Applicant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection, being discharged later that year.  Since\nthat time she has amassed $48,039.00 in delinquent debts, of which $33,263 remained unpaid as of\nthe date of the decision.  \nApplicant married in 1989, but divorced in 1993.  Her ex-husband did not make child support\npayments.  She remarried in 2004, but shortly thereafter her husband suffered a stroke, with resulting\nkidney failure, requiring a transplant.  He is now on disability.  Additionally, Applicant was\nunemployed between September and November 2006.  Her net income from her job is $4,100 a\nmonth, and her husband\u2019s disability pay is $1,300 a month. \n \nQuestion 20 on the Public Trust Position Application asks if Applicant has any debts over\n180 days old.  Applicant replied no to this question.  In fact, she failed to list 11 debts which were\nover 180 days in age.  The Judge stated that Applicant contended she had rushed through the\napplication and had misunderstood the question.\n  \nB.  Discussion\n\n3\nThe Appeal Board\u2019s review of the Judge\u2019s findings of facts is limited to determining if they\nare supported by substantial evidence\u2013such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as\nadequate to support such a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.  Directive\n\u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing\ntwo inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency\u2019s findings\nfrom being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S.\n607, 620-21 (1966).  In evaluating the Judge\u2019s findings, we are required to give deference to the\nJudge\u2019s credibility determinations.  Directive  \u00b6  E3.1.32.1.\nIn the course of arguing the issues raised on appeal, Department Counsel has challenged\nsome of the Judge\u2019s findings of fact.  The Board will address these challenges below. \nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Ultimate Conclusions\nThe Appeal Board may reverse the Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or revoke a\ntrustworthiness determination if it is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See Directive \u00b6\u00b6\nE3.1.32.3 and E3.1.33.3.  Once the government presents evidence raising trustworthiness concerns,\nthe burden shifts to the applicant to establish any appropriate mitigating conditions.  See Directive\n\u00b6 E3.1.15.  \u201cThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and whole person factors\ndoes not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the particular facts of a case.\nRather, their application requires the exercise of sound discretion in light of the record evidence as\na whole.\u201d  See ADP Case No. 05-12037 at 3 (App. Bd. May 10, 2007).  A trustworthiness\ndetermination must be guided by common sense in light of the record as a whole.  See Directive \u00b6\nE2.2.3.  \nIn deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, the Board\nwill review the Judge's decision to determine whether:  it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails\nto articulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of\njudgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision\nthat runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere\ndifference of opinion.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law,\nthe Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of Executive Order 10865, the\nDirective, or other applicable federal law.  See ADP Case No. 06-12901 at 4 (App. Bd. Jul. 31,\n2007).\nOn appeal, Department Counsel takes issue with a finding of the Judge to the effect that, of\nApplicant\u2019s $48,039 of post-bankruptcy debt, \u201capproximately $14,737 has either been paid or deleted\nfrom the 2007 credit report.  The unpaid delinquent debts now total $33,263.\u201d  Decision at 4.\nDepartment Counsel argues that the absence of certain debts from Applicant\u2019s credit report is\n\nSee 15 U.S.C. 1681(c).\n2\n  \n4\nattributable to their age rather than to their having been paid off.   We have examined the record.\n2\nWe note that at least some of the debts which the Judge identified as not being on the credit report\nwere nevertheless acknowledged by Applicant during the hearing as being both legitimate and\nunsatisfied, thereby undermining the Judge\u2019s conclusion.  On the other hand, we also note that\nApplicant testified that some of the debts, including two substantial ones, were listed on the SOR\ntwice.  We find nothing in the record that necessarily discredits that testimony.  Therefore, we are\nnot able to say that the Judge\u2019s conclusion as to the amount of Applicant\u2019s unpaid debt is error.  In\nevaluating the Judge\u2019s analysis, therefore, we will assume that the amount of debt at issue here is\n$33,263.\nIn deciding the case favorably to Applicant, the Judge applied two mitigating conditions,\nFCMC 3 and FCMC 6.  The former mitigates bad debt trustworthiness concerns when an applicant\u2019s\nfinancial problems result from \u201cconditions that . . . were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g.\nloss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation).\u201d  The Judge noted that Applicant had divorced in 1993 and her former husband\nsubsequently failed to pay child support.  She also noted that Applicant remarried in 2004, but that\nher new husband suffered medical problems for which he currently receives disability payments.\nWhile such matters can result in financial difficulties, there appears to be no correlation between\nthese life-altering events and the financial problems alleged in the SOR.  For example, few of the\nalleged debts concern medical bills and those that do are in relatively small amounts.  Indeed,\nApplicant\u2019s bad debts appear to be long standing and ongoing, with many of the larger debts pre-\ndating her second husband\u2019s illness.  Viewed in its entirety, the record does not support the\nconclusion that Applicant has met her burden of persuasion under this mitigating condition.\nFCMC 6 mitigates security concerns when \u201c[t]he individual initiated a good-faith effort to\nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d Applicant provided receipts and other\ndocumentation to corroborate her testimony that she had paid off certain of her debts, or was in the\nprocess of doing so.  However, most of these payments occurred after the issuance of the SOR, many\nonly within weeks of the hearing.  The debts for which Applicant has provided corroborating\nevidence comprise a small fraction of her total amount of unpaid debt.  Furthermore, Applicant has\nclaimed to have paid off certain debts for which she supplied no corroboration, despite the Judge\nhaving given her an opportunity to do so following the close of the hearing.  Tr. at 117.  Given the\nextent of Applicant\u2019s debt problem, and the relative paucity of evidence corroborating her having\nmade good faith efforts to pay them, the record does not support a conclusion that Applicant has met\nher burden of persuasion under this mitigating condition.\nDepartment Counsel has challenged the Judge\u2019s finding that Applicant did not intend to\ndeceive when she denied having any debts over 180 days old.  Applicant contends that she filled out\nher application in haste and did not understand the question, an explanation which the Judge found\nto be plausible.  After examining the record, however, the Board notes significant evidence\ninconsistent with this finding.  Aside from the fact that the question is clear on its face, we note that\nApplicant attended college for a year, a level of education which would make it less likely that she\nwould misunderstand the question at issue.  Similarly, her position as a budget analyst suggests a\n\nSee Response to SOR: \u201cNot taking time to read the question how it was presented, I rushed through the\n3\nquestion causing me to read the question wrong and answer incorrectly.\u201d  Compare with Gov. Ex. 2, Response to\nInterrogatories, at 6: \u201cI did not receive any paperwork that would allow me to list debt.  My clearance was supposed to\ntransfer from my last employer who had a list of all debt.\u201d  Compare also with Tr. at 99: \u201c. . . I had no idea of days at\nthe time, but at the time looking at 180 days, I\u2019m thinking to myself there\u2019s no way I can have anything that high, as far\nas the days are concerned.  And I was thinking I\u2019m sure at the time I\u2019m thinking 120 days at the most, a couple of months,\nbecause I knew before I had had debt.\u201d\n5\nlevel of sophistication at odds with her claim of having not understood the matters which the\nquestion sought to elicit.  Furthermore, she has previously filled out a security clearance application,\nthereby demonstrating general familiarity with the kind of matters covered in adjudications of this\nsort.  Additionally, in her response to the SOR, her answer to interrogatories, and in her testimony\nat the hearing, Applicant provided inconsistent explanations for her having given an incorrect\nresponse to this question.   Applicant\u2019s testimony under cross examination failed to resolve these\n3\ninconsistencies, and the Judge did not address them.  See Tr. at 94-100; Decision at 7.  When\ncombined with her apparent awareness of her lengthy debt problems, we conclude that the Judge did\nnot evaluate Applicant\u2019s explanation in light of all the contrary record evidence and that her finding\nthat the Government failed to meet its burden of production is error.  Furthermore, the Board\u2019s\nexamination of the record evidence provides no basis to conclude that Applicant had met her burden\nof persuasion as to mitigating the Guideline E trustworthiness concerns.\nThe Board has examined the Judge\u2019s whole person analysis.  The Judge stated that Applicant\nis \u201ceager to resolve her financial problems\u201d and could benefit from financial counseling.  Decision\nat 7.  She also noted Applicant\u2019s husband\u2019s medical problems.  Although these are matters which\ncan properly be taken into account in a whole person analysis, the Board concludes that, read  in light\nof the contrary record evidence, they are insufficient to sustain the Judge\u2019s favorable decision.  Given\nthe extent of Applicant\u2019s bad debt, the relative lack of corroboration for those debts she claims to\nhave paid off, her failure seriously to pursue financial counseling, and her inconsistent statements\nconcerning the Guideline E trustworthiness concern, we hold that the Judge\u2019s application of the\nmitigating conditions and her whole person analysis are arbitrary and capricious.\n\n6\nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s favorable trustworthiness determination is REVERSED.  \n   \nSigned: Jean E.

However, the hearing revealed that this was an\n1\nADP case. Accordingly, the case number was changed to reflect that this is an ADP case. Gov. Ex. 1 (Questionnaire for\nPublic Trust Positions (SF 85P), dated March 2, 2004).\nThis action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (Feb.\n2\n20, 1960), as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive).  The procedural rules set out\nin the Directive for security clearance cases are applied to ADP trustworthiness determinations.  The adjudicative\nguidelines set out in Department of Defense Regulation 5200-2R, Personnel Security Program (Jan. 1987), as amended\nand modified (Regulation), are used to make ADP trustworthiness determinations. \nApplicant\u2019s Answer, dated November 11, 2006.\n3\n2\nApplicant is 38 years old and has worked as a budget analyst for a defense contractor since\nNovember 2006. She is raising two minor children from her first marriage. Shortly after marrying\nher second husband, he had a stroke and a kidney transplant and is now on disability. She has\ndelinquent consumer and medical debts totaling approximately $48,000. Of that amount,\napproximately $14,737 has either been paid off or deleted from her credit report. The amount of\nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debt, although not negligible, should not make her vulnerable to coercion,\nexploitation, or duress. Eligibility for an ADP I/II/III position is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn March 2, 2004, Applicant applied for a determination of eligibility for assignment to\nsensitive positions and completed a Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions (SF 85P).  On August\n1\n29, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued her a Statement of Reasons\n(SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary determination that she was not eligible for assignment\nto an Information Systems Position designated ADP I/II/III.  The SOR alleges trustworthiness\n2\nconcerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct).\nIn a sworn, written statement, dated November 11, 2006, Applicant responded to the SOR\nallegations and requested a hearing.  The case was assigned to me on February 5, 2007. A Notice of\n3\nHearing was issued on February 12, 2007, scheduling the hearing for February 27, 2007. The hearing\ntook place as scheduled. Department Counsel submitted six exhibits, Exs. 1-6. Applicant submitted\n14 exhibits (Exs. A-N). All exhibits were admitted without objection. The Transcript (Tr.) was\nreceived on March 9, 2007. The record was left open until March 19, 2007, to allow Applicant the\nopportunity to submit additional documents. By memorandum dated April 4, 2007, Department\nCounsel stated that Applicant had not submitted any additional documents. The record was closed\non April 4, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted some of the factual allegations pertaining to financial considerations\nunder Guideline F and personal conduct, Guideline E. Those admissions are incorporated herein as\n\nTr. 16, 20.\n4\nTr. 20.\n5\nTr. 25.\n6\nTr. 21.\n7\nTr. 19-20.\n8\nTr. 17.\n9\nTr. 42.\n10\nTr. 19.\n11\nTr. 18.\n12\nTr. 133.\n13\nTr. 113.\n14\nTr. 113.\n15\n3\nfindings of fact. She denied some of the other factual allegations under financial considerations.\nAfter a thorough and careful review of the record, I make the following additional findings of fact:\nApplicant is 38 years old and has worked as a budget analyst  for a defense contractor since\n4\nNovember 2006. She has worked for other employers doing budget analyst work since 2004.  \n5\nApplicant first received a security clearance in 1991 while working for the federal government.6\nCurrently, she has a Secret level clearance.  She received an associate\u2019s degree and is currently\n7\nstudying toward a bachelor\u2019s degree in business administration, with a minor in accounting.  \n8\nApplicant\u2019s marriage from 1989 to 1993 ended in divorce.  She was left to raise two children\n9\nfrom that marriage. The children are now aged 16 and 13 and they continue to reside with her. While\nmarried, her husband did not help support the household or the children. She testified\u2013\nAnd the job that I had at the time, I mean I was barely getting by. Apartments and\nthings I had to rent out, then I had to end up leaving those and leaving to go back to\nmy mom\u2019s house and I just didn\u2019t have any help.10\nWhen she divorced her husband, he did not pay child support.  Her ex-husband, the\n11\nbiological father of her children, died in January 2004.  She testified that she \u201cwas in a bad\n12\nrelationship years prior to my second marriage and I accrued a lot of his debt and he has since died\nand I got struck with that.\u201d  Each daughter receives approximately $650 per month in survivors'\n13\nbenefits, until the age of 18.  Applicant uses that money to assist her in paying household bills.\n14\n15\n\nEx. 6 (United States Bankruptcy Court, Discharge of Debtor, dated October 4, 1996).\n16\nTr. 18.\n17\nTr. 18.\n18\nTr. 84.\n19\nTr. 43, 84.\n20\nTr. 43.\n21\nTr. 43.\n22\nTr. 16.\n23\nTr. 43.\n24\nTr. 84.\n25\nEx. 5 (Credit Report, dated February 27, 2007).

Her debts were discharged\non October 4, 1996.  The liabilities or assets related to the discharge are not part of the record.\n16\nIn 2004, Applicant remarried.  Her two stepchildren are aged 22 and 20, and live with their\n17\nmother.  In 2004, shortly after her remarriage, her husband had a stroke.  In 2005, he had a kidney\n18\n19\ntransplant.  He is now on disability.  Applicant stated she has been the sole provider for the family\n20\n21\nsince her husband\u2019s illnesses and his eventual disability, causing her to fall behind in paying all of\nthe household bills.  Their two-family paychecks became one. At one point, her youngest\n22\nstepdaughter\u2019s mother kicked her out of the house. She then moved in with Applicant and her\nhusband for about a year.  Applicant recounted that it was financially rough during this period\n23\nbecause she had to \u201cfinish getting her [stepdaughter] through high school, two years ago. Graduation,\nprom, I tried to send her over to college, got stuck with that bill. So it\u2019s just been a lot going on.\u201d24\nIn September 2006, Applicant lost her job.  She found another job in November 2006. While\n25\nunemployed, her debts became delinquent. Applicant\u2019s 32 delinquent debts total approximately\n$48,039. Of that amount, approximately $14,737 has either been paid or deleted from the 2007 credit\nreport.  The unpaid delinquent debts now total approximately $33,263. Her salary is approximately\n26\n$54,000 annually, which nets about $4,100 a month.  Her husband\u2019s disability pay is $1,300 a\n27\nmonth, and payments began in either \u201cthe latter part of \u201804, maybe \u201805 or so.\u201d  His monthly\n28\n\nTr. 43.\n29\nTr. 86.\n30\nTr. 87.\n31\nTr. 87.\n32\nTr. 91.\n33\nRegulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1.\n34\nRegulation Appendix 8.\n35\nId.\n36\n5\ndisability pay is substantially less than the monthly income he earned prior to his disabilities. Her\nmonthly mortgage is $1,800.29\nApplicant responded \u201cno\u201d to Question 20 on the SF 85P, executed on March 2, 2004, which\nasked the following question (Your Financial record 180 day delinquencies  Are you now over 180\ndays delinquent on any loan or financial obligations? (Include loans or obligations funded or\nguaranteed by the Federal Government). Applicant failed to list those debts that were at least 180\ndays delinquent, as set forth in subparagraphs 1.b through 1.e, 1.h through 1.k, and 1.m through 1.o\nof the SOR. Applicant contends that she misunderstood the question. She rushed through completing\nthe application, causing her to misread the question and answer incorrectly.\nApplicant  worked for a company that assisted people with debt consolidation.  She did have\n30\nthem assist her with a debt for a major department store.  She stopped using the service because she\n31\ncontends that a mortgage lender told her that it she used such a company, it would not reflect well\non her credit.  Once her delinquent debts are satisfied, she would like to buy a house.\n32\n33\nPOLICIES\nTo be eligible for assignment to sensitive duties, an applicant must meet the security\nguidelines contained in the Regulation. \u201cThe standard that must be met for . . . assignment to\nsensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with\nthe interests of national security.\u201d  Appendix 8 of the Regulation sets forth the personnel security\n34\nguidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions under each guideline.\n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.\u201d  Each eligibility\n35\ndetermination must be a fair, impartial, and commonplace decision based on the relevant and\nmaterial facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors listed in the Regulation.36\nAn administrative judge should consider: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2)\nthe circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency\nand recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the\n\nId.\n37\nRegulation \u00b6 C8.2.1. \n38\nDirective, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n39\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n40\nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd.

In trustworthiness determination\n38\ncases, the Government initially must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR that\ndisqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible to occupy an ADP position.39\nThereafter, the applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate the facts.  In security clearance cases, an applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of\n40\ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance.\u201d  \u201cAny doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with\n41\nnational interest will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  The same rules apply to\n42\ntrustworthiness determinations for access to sensitive positions.\nCONCLUSIONS\nFinancial Considerations\nUnder Guideline F, a trustworthiness concern exists for an individual who is financially\noverextended. The person is at risk of having to engage in illegal or unethical acts to generate funds\nto meet financial obligations. Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be\nunconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and safeguarding classified information.\nApplicant has a history of financial problems. Her delinquent debts total approximately $48,039.\nThus, Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions (FC DC) E2.A6.1.2.1 (a history of not\nmeeting financial obligations) and FC DC E2.A6.1.2.3 (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts)\napply.\nVarious conditions can mitigate trustworthiness concerns arising from financial difficulties.\nApplicant has been besieged by financial difficulties arising from both of her marriages. Her first\nmarriage resulted in no financial support from her spouse while he was living in their home, which\nalso included no child support payments when they divorced. Her dire financial situation became\nintolerable and in 1996 she filed for bankruptcy. In the intervening years after the bankruptcy, she\nwas still trying to get her finances unraveled and paid timely. Shortly after her marriage in 2004, her\nhusband suffered a stroke and then had a kidney transplant. Their two-income household dissolved,\n\n7\nand she became the sole supporter for the family. More than a year later, he started to receive\nmonthly disability payments, which were substantially less than his monthly income prior to his\nillnesses. Applicant has been working hard to keep the family financially afloat. Accordingly,\nFinancial Considerations Mitigating Condition (FC MC) E2.A6.1.3.3 (the conditions that resulted\nin the behavior were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation) and FC MC\nE2.A6.1.3.6 (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise\nresolve debts) apply.\nPersonal Conduct\nPersonal conduct under Guideline E is always a trustworthiness concern because it asks the\ncentral question of a person\u2019s past conduct justifies confidence the person can be trusted to properly\nsafeguard sensitive information. Applicant did not deliberately falsify a material fact on her SF 85P.\nI believe she was truthful and credible when she stated that she failed to disclose debts that were over\n180 days delinquent because she misunderstood the question and was rushing through the\napplication. Thus, Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition E2.A5.1.2.2 (the deliberate omission,\nconcealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security\nquestionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine\nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or\ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities) does not apply. \nI have considered all the evidence in this case. I have also considered the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nconcept in evaluating Applicant\u2019s risk and vulnerability in protecting our national interests. At 38,\nApplicant is a mature and earnest woman. She seems eager to resolve her financial problems. She\ncould certainly benefit from some financial counseling to ascertain the true extent of her finances.\nNo doubt she is scared of the financial strains caused by her husband\u2019s stroke and kidney transplant.\nShe is trying to avoid another financial disaster, and is diligently trying to pay off her past and\ncurrent debt. She does not want to file for bankruptcy again. Under these circumstances, Applicant\nhas mitigated the Government\u2019s case under the pertinent financial considerations and personal\nconduct guidelines. Accordingly, I conclude that it is consistent with the national interest to grant\na favorable trustworthiness determination to Applicant.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph one.

She has been unable to resolve these\ndebts.  Mitigation has not been shown. A determination of trustworthiness and access to personal\nsensitive information is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn April 9, 1993, the Composite Health Care Systems Program Office (CHCSPO), the\n\n2\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), and the Assistant Secretary of Defense for\nCommand, Control, Communications and Intelligence (ASD C3I) entered into a memorandum of\nagreement for DOHA to provide trustworthiness determinations for contractor personnel employed\nin Information Systems Positions as defined in DoD Regulation 5200.2R, Personnel Security\nProgram (Regulation), dated January of 1987.\nOn July 17, 2007, DOHA, pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the\nApplicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding\nunder the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a\ndetermination of trustworthiness, suitability, and eligibility for the Applicant to hold a sensitive\nSystems Position (ADP-I/II/III).\nIn a signed and sworn statement, notarized on September 12, 2007, Applicant responded to\nthe SOR allegations (RSOR)and requested a hearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.\nOn October 15, 2007, this case was assigned to this Administrative Judge to conduct a\nhearing and issue a written decision. A Notice of Hearing was issued to the parties on October 24,\n2007, and the hearing was conducted in Sacramento, California, on November 15, 2007. \nAt the hearing, Department Counsel offered nine documentary exhibits (Exhibits 1 through\n9) and no witnesses were called. Applicant offered two documentary exhibits (Exhibits A and B) at\nthe hearing and offered her own testimony. The transcript (Tr) was received on December 3, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nIn the SOR, the Government alleges concern under Adjudicative Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations) of the Directive. The SOR contains 30 allegations, 1.a., through 1.dd., under\nGuideline F. In her RSOR, Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations.

This overdue debt to Creditor 24 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $5,000 for a\njudgement entered against Applicant  in July 2005. Applicant testified that $41 is deducted from her\npaycheck every two weeks to pay this debt, and thus far she has paid $902 on this debt (Exhibit B).\n1.aa. This overdue debt to Creditor 25 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $168.\n1.bb. This overdue debt to Creditor 26 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $551.\n1.cc. This overdue debt to Creditor 27 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $436.\n1.dd. This overdue debt to Creditor 28 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $79.\nApplicant testified that most of these debts occurred more than five years ago. As discussed\nabove, she has three young children, and she has only received minimal financial support from the\nman who is the father of the children, and to whom she was never married. \nAlso, in 1997, Applicant\u2019s  second child was prematurely born, when Applicant  was in her\ntwenty fifth week of pregnancy, Her son weighed only one pound, 14 ounces, and he was extremely\nill. This resulted in Applicant being unable to work for approximately one year and ten months to\nprovide care for him (Tr at 23-25).  \nApplicant further testified that some of these overdue bills listed on the SOR are for medical\nservices which should have been paid by the state medical insurance, but she has not been able to\nresolve these debts. \nFinally, Applicant testified that she has an uncle, who is an attorney and is knowledgeable\nin finance. She plans to consult him and seek help from him shortly. However, despite the fact that\nshe has been aware of the concern of the Government at least since the interrogatories about finances\nwere propounded to her and to which she responded on March 28, 2007, (Exhibit 2) at the time of\nthe hearing she had not consulted her uncle or requested any kind of help from him. \nApplicant submitted a letter from her direct supervisor (Exhibit A) who described Applicant\nas professional and reliable, and wrote that Applicant \u201chas shown compassion and integrity in her\n\n5\njob duties.\u201d\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the 1992 Directive set forth both policy factors, and\nconditions that could raise or mitigate concerns.  Furthermore, as set forth in the Directive, each\ndecision must be a fair and impartial common sense determination based upon consideration of all\nthe relevant and material information and the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in enclosure\n2, including as appropriate:\na. Nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct, and surrounding\ncircumstances.\nb. Frequency and recency of the conduct.\n \nc. Age and maturity of the applicant.\nd. Motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct\nwas negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of\nthe consequence involved.\ne. Absence or presence of rehabilitation.\nf. Probability that circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in\nthe future.\u201d\nThe Administrative Judge, however, can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have\na reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or\nconclusions based on evidence that is speculative or conjectural in nature.\nThe Government must make out a case under Guideline F, which establishes doubt about a\nperson's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.  While a rational connection, or nexus, must be\nshown between an applicant's adverse conduct and her suitability for a sensitive Systems Position,\nwith respect to sufficiency of proof of a rational connection, objective or direct evidence is not\nrequired.\nThen, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in refutation,\nexplanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past adverse conduct is unlikely\nto be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for a sensitive Systems Position.\nCONCLUSIONS\nHaving considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal precepts and\nfactors, I conclude the following with respect to Guideline F: \nThe Government has established its case under Guideline F. The record evidence clearly\n\n6\nestablishes Applicant's long history of indebtedness, and there is no evidence that Applicant has\nresolved these overdue debts or even made an attempt.\nApplicant's overall conduct pertaining to her financial obligations falls within Financial\nConsiderations Disqualifying Condition (DC) 19. (a), and DC 19. (c), a history of not meeting\nfinancial obligations, and an inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts. While Mitigating Condition\n(MC) 20. (b) could be argued to apply, because the Applicant\u2019s debt arose in part because the father\nof her children failed to pay child support and one of her children\u2019s premature birth forced her to\nmiss almost two years of employment, Applicant has failed to take any action to attempt to resolve\nthese overdue debts, thus failing to act responsibly. Therefore, this Mitigating Condition does not\napply in this case. I do not find that any other Mitigating Condition is applicable to this case. \nUntil Applicant is able to make a good-faith effort to resolve her debts, and she can establish\na record of financial responsibility and stability, concerns will continue to exist under Guideline F.\nI resolve Guideline F against Applicant.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nParagraph 1.

Unfortunately, that service\nfailed to pay his creditors. Applicant\u2019s situation became so dire, he filed for chapter 7 bankruptcy.\nApplicant and his wife have taken debtor counseling courses and have established a budget\ndemonstrating they have the wherewithal to maintain financial stability. Two of Applicant\u2019s three\nchildren have severe medical problems. Applicant presented sufficient information to explain,\nextenuate, or mitigate the security concern. Clearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn November 15, 2005, Applicant submitted a Security Clearance Application (SF 86).  On\n1\nMarch 6, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons\n(SOR) to him, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within\nIndustry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive\n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January\n2, 1992, as amended, modified and revised.  \n2\nThe SOR alleges security concerns under Guidelines F (Financial Considerations). The SOR\ndetailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive\nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for him,\nand recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be\ngranted, continued, denied, or revoked.\nIn an answer dated and notarized on May 24, 2007, Applicant responded to the SOR\nallegations and requested a hearing. The case was assigned to me on July 7, 2007. On August 1,\n2007, DOHA issued a notice of hearing scheduling the case to be heard on August 23, 2007.  The\nhearing was held as scheduled. On September 5, 2007, DOHA received the transcript (Tr.). I left the\nrecord open until September 7, 2007 to afford the Applicant an opportunity to submit additional\nmaterial.  He timely submitted additional material, which was marked and appended to the record.\nFINDINGS OF FACT \n\nG E 1, supra n. 1.is the basis for the facts in this paragraph, unless otherwise stated.\n3\n3\nIn his reply to the SOR, Applicant admitted all indebtedness. His admissions are incorporated\nherein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make\nthe following findings of fact.  \nApplicant is 43 years old.  He graduated from high school in June 1984. Tr. 16-17. He served\n3\nin the U.S. Army from August 1984 to May 1988, and held a secret clearance. Tr. 17-18. He served\nin the U.S. Army Reserves from August 1997 to December 1999, and held a secret clearance. He\nserved in the National Guard from December 1999 to December 2003, and held a top secret\nclearance.  AE C. He married in June 1999 and has three children, two daughters, ages four and\nthree, and a son, age one. He is employed by a defense contractor as an associate analyst and seeks\na security clearance as a condition of employment.\nApplicant and his family live in a depressed area with a high unemployment rate. Their four-\nyear-old daughter has asthma, and their one-year-old son has been diagnosed with vascular ring,\nwhich is a condition where the large blood vessels coming from his heart are abnormally arranged\nand are compressing his breathing tubes. Treatment for this condition is surgical manipulation of the\nblood vessels so that they no longer compress the breathing tubes. Treatment is costly and long term.\nAE A.\nApplicant has a history of financial problems. The SOR lists 11 unpaid debts ranging from\n$875 to $6,985, exceeding $32,000. These debts were primarily incurred on family or household\nitems such as food, uncovered medical expenses, home computer, windows and siding for their\nhome, and home improvements. The majority of these debts were incurred in the 2004-to-2005 time\nframe. Applicant\u2019s wife handled the family budget during this time and found herself reallocating\ntheir limited resources and was unable to stay afloat. Unknown to Applicant, she resorted to opening\ncredit card accounts and began using borrowed money to make payments. To make matters worse,\nshe lost her $9 an hour job as a telemarketer when she was eight months pregnant with their third\nchild.  \nAfter the birth of her third child, Applicant\u2019s wife developed and experienced severe post\npartem depression. While in this condition, she suddenly left her husband and children in September\n2006 and she remained away until November 2006. During her absence, Applicant cared for their\nthree young children with the help of his mother-in-law while he worked full time. To make matters\nworse, Applicant\u2019s young son required extensive medical treatment. To ensure his son received the\nnecessary care, he was required to take time off from work without pay to make numerous trips to\na major medical facility a considerable distance from his home.  \nApplicant\u2019s wife eventually did return to the family home and sought professional help for\nher depression. Applicant recognized he was in financial trouble and in June 2005 sought the\nservices of a professional credit counseling company.  Pursuant to an agreement with that company,\nthe company agreed to consolidate Applicant\u2019s debts, and Applicant was required to make monthly\npayments to the credit counseling company. Applicant made payments to the company for six\nmonths until he discovered the company had not made any payments on his behalf to any of his\ncreditors. AE A. \n\n4\nApplicant\u2019s financial situation had deteriorated to the point where he felt he had no option\nleft other than to seek bankruptcy relief. In January 2006, Applicant consulted and retained the\nservices of bankruptcy lawyer. His bankruptcy lawyer counseled Applicant to cease making any\nfurther payments to his creditors. Unfortunately, his bankruptcy lawyer did not file Applicant\u2019s\nchapter 7 bankruptcy petition until March 2007. It took considerable coaxing from Applicant\u2019s\ncounsel representing him at hearing to prompt his bankruptcy lawyer to file and complete the\nnecessary work. Applicant was granted a discharge of all his debts in July 2007.\nUpon Department Counsel\u2019s review of Applicant\u2019s March 2007 bankruptcy petition (GE 8),\nhe noted the debt listed in SOR \u00b6 1.e. was not included on Applicant\u2019s petition. Applicant submitted\npost-hearing materials that addressed this point. Applicant\u2019s bankruptcy attorney drafted a letter\nindicating the debt in question was, in fact, discharged. Having reviewed Department Counsel\u2019s post-\nhearing comments, I resolve any doubt about this debt in favor of Applicant. AE D. As such, I have\nconcluded all debts listed in the SOR were discharged in bankruptcy.\nApplicant and his wife have completed a debtor education program offered through a credit\ncounseling service. Additionally, Applicant completed a personal financial management course.\nApplicant submitted a budget showing a net remainder of $438. AE D. Applicant also submitted six\nletters/certificates that demonstrate his value as an employee and his superb work ethic. AE B.\nApplicant\u2019s family budget does not contain any luxury items, but is rather bare-boned and accounts\nfor only the life necessities required to maintain two adults and three small children.\nPOLICIES\nIn an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s security suitability, an administrative judge must consider\nthe \u201cAdjudicative Guideline for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified Information\u201d\n(Guideline[s]), which sets forth adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief introductory explanations\nfor each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines are divided into Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and\nMitigating Conditions (MC), which are used to determine an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to\nclassified information.\nThese Guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, an administrative judge should apply these guidelines in\nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. Guideline \u00b6 2. An administrative\njudge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. Because the\nentire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person\nconcept,\u201d an administrative judge should consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nSpecifically, an administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors\nlisted at Guideline \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency\nand recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5)\nextent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\n\n \u201cSubstantial e vidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept\n4\nas adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR\nCase N o. 04-11463 at 2 (App. B d. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing D irective \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cT his is\nsomething less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two inconsistent\nconclusions from the evidence does not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being sup p o rted by\nsubstantial evidence.\u201d Consolo v. Federal M aritim e Com m \u2019n, 383 U .S. 607, 620  (1 9 6 6).\n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v.\nW ashington M etro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4  Cir. 1994).\nth\n \u201cT he Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable\n5\nand unfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circum stances in light of pertinent\nprovisions of the D irective, and decide[s] whether A pplicant ha[s] m et his burden of persuasion\nunder D irective \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d ISCR Case N o. 04-10340 at 2 (App. B d. July 6, 2006). \n5\nSince the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision\nin each case is arrived at by applying the standard that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being\nconsidered for access to classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d\nGuideline \u00b6 2(b). In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable,\nlogical and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing\ninferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nIn the decision-making process, the Government has the initial burden of establishing\ncontroverted facts by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d  demonstrating, in accordance with the Directive, that\n4\nit is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to\nclassified information. Once the Government has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying\ncondition, the burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] has the\nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\nThe burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No.\n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).5\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with\nthe government predicated upon trust and confidence. It is a relationship that transcends normal duty\nhours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is because of this special relationship the\ngovernment must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom\nit grants access to classified information. Decisions under this Directive include, by necessity,\nconsideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible\nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nThe scope of an administrative judge\u2019s decision is limited. Nothing in this Decision should\nbe construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied\ndetermination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.  Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7. \nCONCLUSIONS\n\nRevised Guidelines at 13-14 (setting forth the disqualifying and mitigating conditions).\n6\nDC 19(a) is \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.\u201d\n7\nDC 19(c) is \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d\n8\nMC 20(b) is \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control\n9\n(e.g., loss of employment, . . ., unexpected medical emergency, . . . or separation), and the individual acted\nresponsibly under the circumstances.\u201d\nMC 20(c) is \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear\n10\nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.\u201d\n6\nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate legal\nprecepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly above, I conclude the following\nwith respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR:\nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations,  a security concern typically exists due to\n6\nsignificant unpaid debts.  Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by\nrules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal or unethical acts to general funds to meet\nfinancial obligations. Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be\nirresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and safeguarding classified\ninformation.\nThe record evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial problems.\nHis history of financial problems is a security concern because it indicates inability or unwillingness\nto satisfy debts  and a history of not meeting financial obligations  within the meaning of Guideline\n7\n8\nF.  The record is more than sufficient to establish these two disqualifying conditions.\nApplicant received credit in mitigation. Applicable mitigating conditions under Guideline\nF include the second , third , and fourth mitigating conditions. While Applicant is ultimately\n9\n10\nresponsible for incurring debt, several factors are noteworthy. Recognizing Applicant should have\nused better oversight in managing his family budget, I cannot ignore the reality of Applicant\u2019s\nsituation. At the time these debts were incurred, his wife managed the family budget and he was\nworking full time. While managing the budget, Applicant\u2019s wife was experiencing severe depression.\nShe admitted opening credit card accounts for the purpose of using the lines of credit to pay other\ndebts. From the evidence presented, none of the debts Applicant incurred could be construed as\n\u201cextravagant,\u201d but rather were related to sustaining the household and family. Applicant\u2019s wife lost\nher modest income as a telemarketer when she was eight months pregnant with their youngest child.\nTo make matters worse, Applicant and his wife were faced with more than the usual\nchallenges as parents of young children when their four-year-old daughter was diagnosed with\nasthma, and their one-year-old son was born with the very serious condition of vascular ring. When\nApplicant realized he was in financial trouble, he wanted to repay his creditors and sought the services\nof a professional credit counseling service. For six months, he diligently paid that service only to later\nfind out that the service did not pay his creditors and he was in deeper financial trouble than he was\n\nSee ISCR Case N o. 04-06242 at 2 (App. B d. June 28, 2006). \n11\n7\nbefore he started the process. Reluctantly, he sought the services of a bankruptcy attorney and again\nwas \u201clet down\u201d when his bankruptcy attorney took over a year to file his bankruptcy petition.\nApplicant\u2019s security clearance attorney apparently was able to assist Applicant\u2019s bankruptcy attorney\nto file the necessary paperwork to initiate bankruptcy proceedings.\nIn September 2006, Applicant\u2019s wife suddenly left Applicant and his three young children.\nTo Applicant\u2019s credit he continued to work full-time, and cared for his children with the help of his\nmother-in-law. When his wife returned, Applicant and his wife sought to return to normalcy through\ncounseling and professional assistance. Both Applicant and his wife have sought financial counseling\nand are equipped with the tools to avoid financial pitfalls. Applicant has addressed his financial\nproblems, has cash left over, and is otherwise living within his means. Although one can attempt to\nfault him for taking too long to address his indebtedness, he has since taken action to minimize and\novercome concerns about his financial situation. His history of successfully maintaining a security\nclearance without incident stemming back to his Army and National Guard service, his positive\nemployment record, and mettle he showed by caring for his three small children weigh heavily in his\nfavor in assessing his security eligibility under the \u201cwhole person\u201d analysis.\nBased on the record evidence as a whole, Applicant presented sufficient evidence to explain,\nextenuate, or mitigate the financial considerations security concern.  Likewise, he has met his ultimate\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.\nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d  and supporting evidence, my\n11\napplication of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative Process, and my interpretation of my\nresponsibilities under the Guideline.

She has yet to file a bankruptcy action.  Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn March 14, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearing and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement\nof Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision to deny a security clearance for Applicant.  The\naction was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1990), as amended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), using the\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\nimplemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006.  Applicant acknowledged receipt\nof the SOR on March 19, 2007.  The SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the Directive.\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on May 2, 2007.  She admitted the sixteen allegations\nunder Guideline F, noting that two of the delinquent debts had been satisfied.   She denied the\n1\nallegation under Guideline E with an explanation.  She elected to have the matter decided on the\nwritten record in lieu of a hearing.\nDepartment Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written case on June 13, 2007.  Applicant\nreceived a complete file of relevant material (FORM) on June 19, 2007, and was provided the\nopportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the disqualifying\nconditions.  Appellant was granted an extension until August 19, 2007 to reply.  Her reply, dated\nAugust 16, 2007, was received by Department Counsel on August 28, 2007.   On August 28, 2007,\n2\nDepartment Counsel forwarded Applicant\u2019s response and noted no objection to consideration of the\nresponse.   The case was assigned to me on August 15, 2007.\n3\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant is 36 years old and has been a mail clerk for a defense contractor since January\n2006.  She was married with three children.  Her husband left the family leaving her a single mother\nraising the children.

Subsequent investigation reveals Applicant\n4\nhas delinquent debts.5\nDelinquent debt 1 (SOR 1.a) is a judgment for $3,484.  Applicant presented sufficient\ninformation to establish that her former husband\u2019s wages were garnished to pay the judgment.  All\nbut about $600 of the judgment had been paid.   Since the judgment was being paid by garnishment\n6\nof her husband\u2019s wages, and they were not communicating, she was not aware the judgment had not\nbeen satisfied.  \n7\nApplicant admitted to all of the remaining delinquent debts.  These debts included a medical\naccount for $62 (SOR 1.c); a telephone debt to SPRINT for $631 (SOR, 1.d); a cable bill to\nCOMCAST for $239 (SOR 1.e); a telephone bill to Bell South for $882 (SOR 1.f); an account with\nFirst Bank more than 180 days delinquent for $588 (SOR 1.g); an account with Miraglia for $237\nmore than 180 days delinquent (SOR 1.h); an account with Washington Mutual more than 180 days\ndelinquent for $455 (SOR 1.i); another cable debt with COMCAST more than $180 days delinquent\nfor $255 (SOR 1.j); an account with AAC for $527 (SOR 1.k); an account with Natcreadj for $325\n(SOR 1.l); an utility account with PG&E for $96 (SOR 1.m); an account with Palisades for $661\n(SOR 1.n); an account with Drivefin for $10,311 more than 180 days delinquent (SOR, 1.o); and an\naccount with First Premier more than 180 days delinquent for $411 (SOR, 1.p).   \n8\nIn her response to the FORM, Applicant noted that her debt problems arose because she\nbecame a single mother caring for three children.  Her husband was responsible for much of the\ndelinquent debts.  He would purchase items, lose his job, and not able to pay for the items.  He left\nthe family placing the burden on her to pay the debts.  However, all she was able to do was provide\nher children with the necessities of living.  In response to an interrogatory, Applicant stated that she\nwould file for bankruptcy for these debts.   Applicant contacted an attorney in 2006 to file\n9\nbankruptcy for her, but the action was terminated because she could not pay the lawyer\u2019s fees.10\nWhen she has the funds, she will again try to file a bankruptcy action.  She wants to lower the\namount of her debt.   She recently contacted a credit counseling agency through her employer for\n11\nsome assistance in resolving her debts.12\n\nSee, Item 3.\n13\nDepartment of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n14\nDirective \u00b6 E2.2.1.\n15\nAG \u00b6 2(a).\n16\nId.\n17\nSee Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7.\n18\n4\nApplicant responded \u201cNO\u201d to question 27(d) on her January 2006 security clearance\napplication asking if there were any unpaid judgments against her.  Approximately $600 is still owed\non a judgment entered against she and her husband.  Garnishment of her husband\u2019s wages paid most\nof the judgment.  Applicant thought the entire judgment was paid by the garnishment.13\nPOLICIES\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national\nsecurity and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . .\nthat will give that person access to such information.\u201d   Eligibility for a security clearance is\n14\npredicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.15\nThe Directive sets out the adjudicative guidelines for making decisions on security clearances.\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines for determining eligibility for access\nto classified information, and it lists the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions for each\nguideline.  The adjudicative guidelines for this case are the guidelines promulgated by the President\non December 29, 2005, and implemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006.  Each\nclearance decision must be fair, impartial, and a commonsense decision based on the relevant and\nmaterial facts and circumstances, and the whole person concept.16\nThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.  An administrative\njudge must apply the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d and consider and carefully weigh the available, reliable\ninformation about the person.  An administrative judge should consider: (1) the nature, extent, and\nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the applicant\u2019s age and maturity at the\ntime of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the\npotential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation of\nrecurrence.17\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the\ngovernment.  The government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those\nindividuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  The decision to deny an individual a\nsecurity clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.   It is merely\n18\nan indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of\n\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n19\nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002); see Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n20\nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \n21\nISCR Case No. 99-0597 (App. Bd. Dec 13, 2000).\n22\nISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996) (quoting DISCR Case No. 92-1106 (App. Bd. Oct. 7,\n23\n1993))\nEgan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).\n24\nAG \u00b6 18.\n25\nAG \u00b6 15.\n26\n5\nDefense have established for issuing a clearance.\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR that\ndisqualify or may disqualify the Applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.19\nThereafter, Applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nfacts.   An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the\n20\nnational interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d   The government is under no duty to\n21\npresent evidence to disprove any Adjudicative Guideline mitigating condition, and an Administrative\nJudge cannot assume or infer that any particular mitigating condition is applicable merely because the\ngovernment does not present evidence to disprove that particular mitigating condition.   \u201c[T]he\n22\nDirective presumes there is a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the\ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.\u201d   \u201cAny doubt as to whether access to\n23\nclassified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the\nnational security.\u201d24\nBased upon a consideration of the evidence, I find the following adjudicative guidelines most\npertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case:\nGuideline F - Financial Considerations: A security concern exists because a failure or\ninability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may\nindicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and\nregulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information.  An individual who is\nfinancially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds.25\nGuideline E - Personal Conduct: Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of\ncandor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid\nanswers during the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the\nsecurity clearance process.26\n\n6\nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which\nwould mitigate security concerns, pertaining to the adjudicative guidelines are set forth and discussed\nin the conclusions section below.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI carefully considered all of the facts in evidence and the legal standards discussed above.  I\nreach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the SOR.\nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts noted in credit reports and admitted by Applicant bring the matter\nwithin Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions (FC DC) \u00b6 19(a) (Inability or unwillingness\nto satisfy debts), and FC DC \u00b6 19(c) (A history of not meeting financial obligations).  Since Applicant\nadmitted fourteen of the fifteen alleged delinquent debts, I conclude the above disqualifying conditions\nhave been established.\nAppellant\u2019s answer to the SOR only questions one of the debts, a judgement almost completely\npaid by garnishment of her husband\u2019s wages.  This debt still has a remaining balance that neither\nApplicant nor her husband satisfied.  Applicant was made aware of the remaining amount of the debt\nbut presented no information on any efforts to pay the debt once advised the debt was still outstanding.\nApplicant stated that she became a single mother raising three children after her husband left\nthe family.  Most of the debts were incurred by her former husband who lost jobs and left her to pay\nthe debts.  She raised Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition (FC MC) \u00b6 20(b) (The conditions\nthat resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g. loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances).  While the issue was raised by\nApplicant\u2019s response, she presented no additional information concerning any efforts to make\narrangements to pay some of the debts.  The debts are basically for small amounts and not for\nnecessities of life for her or her children.  None of the 15 debts, no matter how small or large, have\nbeen addressed.  She has not shown that she acted responsibly under the circumstances.\nApplicant\u2019s proposed solution to resolving the 15 debts was to file a bankruptcy petition.\nBankruptcy is a legal and permissible means of resolving debt problems.  However, promises to take\nan action in the future is not sufficient to establish a good-faith intent to resolve debts.  FC MC \u00b6 20(d)\n(The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts) does\nnot apply.  \nApplicant\u2019s response also does not raise FC MC \u00b6 20(a) (The behavior happened so long ago,\nwas so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgement).  The debts have not\nbeen paid, so the failure to resolve debts is recent.  There are 15 debts so her debt accumulation is\nfrequent, and there are no known circumstances that would indicate that her financial problems would\nnot recur. \nBehaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life provides an indication of how a\nperson may behave in other aspects of life.  A person\u2019s relationship with her creditors is a private\nmatter until evidence is uncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under\n\n10 U.S. C. \u00a7 1001.\n27\n7\nagreed upon terms.  Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an applicant\nwith a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a situation of risk inconsistent with the\nholding of a security clearance.  An applicant is not required to be debt free, but is required to manage\nher finances in such a way as to meet her financial obligations.  Applicant admits to 15 delinquent\ndebts totaling over $15,000.  Applicant stated she would file for bankruptcy to pay these debts, but has\nyet to fileor take other action to resolve them.  She presented no proof of any inquiries on the debts or\nattempts to make payments. \nApplicant\u2019s failure to list a judgment not fully paid in response to question 27(d) on her\nsecurity clearance application raises Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) \u00b6 16(a) (the\ndeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from the personal\nsecurity questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations . .\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness).  Personal conduct is always a security\nconcern because it asks the central question does the person\u2019s past conduct justify confidence the\nperson can be trusted to properly safeguard classified information.  The security clearance system\ndepends on an individual providing correct and accurate information.  If a person conceals or provides\nfalse information, the security clearance process cannot function properly to ensure that granting access\nto classified information is in the best interest of the United States Government.  A deliberate omission\nor false statement on a security clearance application is a criminal offense under federal law.27\nThe judgment was entered against both Applicant and her husband.  Applicant knew her\nhusband\u2019s wages were garnished for the judgment.  Almost all of the over $3,000 judgment, except\nfor about $600, had been paid by the garnishment.  She never received a notice that the garnishment\nhad not completely paid the judgment.  Her explanation that she believed the entire judgment had been\nsatisfied is reasonable under the circumstances.  The question on the security clearance application\nasks if there were any judgments in the last seven years that were not paid.  It is conceivable for\nApplicant to believe the judgment was paid and her answer of \u201cno\u201d was correct.  This is even clearer\nsince the other judgment initially listed as a security concern by the government had been paid in full\nby garnishment.  I find Applicant did not intentionally fail to provide correct information in response\nto question 27(d) on the security clearance application.\nI carefully considered all of the circumstances in light of the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept.  I\nconclude Applicant is not eligible for access to classified information.  Applicant has shown an\nirresponsible attitude toward her debts.  She presented insufficient information to explain the debts or\nmitigate the disqualifying conditions.  She failed to carry her burden to refute, extenuate, or mitigate\nthe fifteen delinquent debts.  I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns for financial\nconsiderations.  She did mitigate security concerns raised under the guideline for Personal Conduct.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as required by Section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\n\n8\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.:\nDeleted by Government\nSubparagraph 1.c.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.n.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.o.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.p.:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a.:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national security to grant or continue access to classified information for Applicant.\nClearance is denied.\nThomas M.

    "summary": "FINDINGS OF FACT The following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the documents and the live testimony. The Applicant is 45 years of age, and is employed by a defense contractor who seeks a security clearance on behalf of the Applicant. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the same, I make the following additional Findings of Fact. Guideline H - Drug Involvement & Guideline E - Personal Conduct 1.a. and 1.b. The Applicant used marijuana, with varying frequency from about 1983 until his last usage during \u201cthe first six months\u201d of 1997 (TR at page 99 line 16 to page 100 line 2, at page 110 lines 7~22, and at page 122 line 16 to page 123 line 13).

He \u201cgot religion,\u201d turned his life around, and has no intention of marijuana in the future.\nThe Applicant\u2019s one and only conviction for Promoting Contraband in the 1  Degree - Class C\nst\nFelony, occurred nearly 20 years ago in 1988.  This conviction was \u201cset aside\u201d by a court order in\n1990.  As a result, the Applicant thought he did no have to disclose this conviction in answer to\nquestion 23.a. on his November 2005 Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP).  As his last marijuana usage occurred in 1997, he did not disclose this Drug Involvement in\nanswer to question 24.a. on his e-QIP.  Mitigation is shown.  Clearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn September 29, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2,\n1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed the reasons why DOHA\ncould not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and\nrecommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied\nor revoked.\nApplicant filed an Answer to the SOR on October 25, 2006.\nThe case was originally assigned to another Administrative Judge, but was reassigned to the\nundersigned on March 19, 2007.  A notice of hearing had already been  issued on February 27, 2007,\nand the case was heard on April 4, 2007.  The Government submitted documentary evidence, and\ncalled one witness to testify.  Testimony was taken from the Applicant, who called four witnesses\nto testify on his behalf, and also submitted documentary evidence.  The transcript (TR) was received\non April 13, 2007.  The issues raised here are whether the Applicant's past Drug Involvement, past\nCriminal Conduct, and perceived Personal Conduct militate against the granting of a security\nclearance.  [The Applicant denies all of the allegations, except for 1.b. and 2.a. as they both related\nto his 1988 arrest and subsequent conviction.]\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the documents\nand the live testimony.  The Applicant is 45 years of age, and is employed by a defense contractor\nwho seeks a security clearance on behalf of the Applicant.  After a complete and thorough review\nof the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the same, I make the following\nadditional Findings of Fact.\nGuideline H - Drug Involvement & Guideline E - Personal Conduct\n1.a. and 1.b.  The Applicant used marijuana, with varying frequency from about 1983 until\nhis last usage during \u201cthe first six months\u201d of 1997 (TR at page 99 line 16 to page 100 line 2, at page\n110 lines 7~22, and at page 122 line 16 to page 123 line 13).  During the 1980's, he smoked\n\n3\nmarijuana mostly with his sister in state A, and in the 1990's mostly with others in state B (Id).  Since\nmoving back to state A from state B, in 1997, he no longer associates with his sister, has become a\nreligious person, and has ceased any Drug Involvement (TR at page 99 line 16 to page 100 line 2,\nat page 110 lines 7~22, and at page 122 line 16 to page 123 line 13).  His \u201cgetting religion\u201d and last\nmarijuana usage is corroborated by three witnesses (TR at page 56 lines 7~23, at page 66 line 23 to\npage 69 line 14, at page 73 line 20 to page 74 line 12, and at page 84 lines 3~20).\n2.b. and 3.b.  In answering question 24.a. on his November 2005 e-QIP, the Applicant did\nnot disclose his past Drug Involvement, as it did not occur \u201cin the last 7 years\u201d (TR at page 89 line\n13 to page 91 line 19, and Government Exhibit (GX) 1 at page 23).\nGuideline J - Criminal Conduct & Guideline E - Personal Conduct\n2.a.  In 1988, the Applicant was arrested for, and subsequently pled no contest to, Promoting\nContraband in the 1  Degree - Class C Felony (GX 2).  He was a guard at a correctional facility, and\nst\nintroduced some marijuana into the facility in order to avoid a threat from an inmate (GX 3).  In\n1990, this conviction was \u201cset aside\u201d by a court order (AppX A).\n2.b. and 3.a.  In answering question 23.a. on his November 2005 e-QIP, the Applicant did\nnot disclose his felony conviction, as he thought it was \u201cset aside;\u201d and as such, he did not have to\ndisclose it (TR at page 102 line 2 to page 103 line 7, at page 122 lines 3~15, and GX 1 at page 22).\nHe had no intention of keeping this information from the Government (TR at page 122 lines 3~15).\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the 1992 Directive set forth both policy factors, and\nconditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern.  Furthermore, as set forth in the Directive,\neach clearance decision must be a fair and impartial common sense determination based upon\nconsideration of all the relevant and material information and the pertinent criteria and adjudication\npolicy in enclosure 2, including as appropriate:\na. Nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct, and surrounding\ncircumstances.\nb. Frequency and recency of the conduct.\nc. Age and maturity of the applicant.\nd. Motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct\nwas negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of\nthe consequence involved.\ne. Absence or presence of rehabilitation.\nf. Probability that circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in\nthe future.\n\n4\nThe Administrative Judge, however, can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have\na reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or\nconclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.\nThe Government must make out a case under Guidelines H (Drug Involvement), J (Criminal\nConduct), and E (Personal Conduct); which establishes doubt about a person's judgment, reliability\nand trustworthiness.  While a rational connection, or nexus, must be shown between an applicant's\nadverse conduct and his ability to effectively safeguard classified information, with respect to\nsufficiency of proof of a rational connection, objective or direct evidence is not required.\nThen, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in refutation,\nexplanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past adverse conduct is unlikely\nto be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for a security clearance.\nA pattern of Criminal Conduct and illegal Drug Involvement raise questions regarding an\nindividual\u2019s willingness or ability to protect classified information.  Unacceptable Personal Conduct\nis conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, or unwillingness to\ncomply with rules and regulations.  The Government must be able to place a high degree of\nconfidence in a security clearance holder to abide by all security rules and regulations at all times\nand in all places.  If an applicant has demonstrated a lack of respect for the law, there then exists the\npossibility that an applicant may demonstrate the same attitude towards security rules and\nregulations.\nCONCLUSIONS\nConsidering first the Applicant\u2019s past Drug Involvement, the Applicant  used marijuana from\nabout 1984 until his last usage in 1997.  The first and third disqualifying conditions are therefore\napplicable.  There was \u201cdrug abuse,\u201d and a \u201cdistribution.\u201d  However, I find the first and second\nmitigating conditions applicable here, as \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago [in 1997] . . . that it is\nunlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment,\u201d and the Applicant has a \u201cdemonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future.\u201d\nConsidering next his Criminal Conduct, there was a conviction in 1988 that was later set\naside.  I find the first disqualifying condition applicable, as there is \u201csingle serious crime.\u201d  This is\ncountered, however, by the first and fourth mitigating conditions.  The \u201cso much time has elapsed\nsince the criminal behavior, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to\nrecur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d\nThere is also \u201cevidence of successful rehabilitation.\u201d\nFinally as to his alleged Personal Conduct, I find no wilful falsification here.  His last drug\ninvolvement occurred more than 7 years ago; and as such, there was no requirement that it be\ndisclosed.  As to the failure to report the felony conviction, the Applicant thought that by it being set\naside, he was not required to disclosed it.\nFurthermore, I am not limited to the mitigating conditions, delineated in the Directive, in\ndeciding if an Applicant has demonstrated extenuation or mitigation.  Here, those who know the\n\n5\nApplicant at the workplace, and in the community, speak most highly of his character, credibility and\ntrustworthiness (AppXs B~D).  The totality of the Appellant\u2019s conduct and circumstances, as set\nforth at length above, clearly warrants a favorable Decision under the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d\nMitigation is shown; and as such, Guidelines H, J and E are found for the Applicant.\nConsidering all the evidence, the Applicant has rebutted the Government's case regarding his\nDrug Involvement, Criminal Conduct, and Personal Conduct.  The Applicant has thus met the\nmitigating conditions of Guidelines H, J and E, and of Section E.2.2. of the Directive.  Accordingly,\nhe has met his ultimate burden of persuasion under Guideline H, J and E.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings required by paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1:\nFOR THE APPLICANT\na. For the Applicant.\nb. For the Applicant.\nParagraph 2:\nFOR THE APPLICANT\na.  For the Applicant.\nb.  For the Applicant.\nParagraph 3:\nFOR THE APPLICANT\na. For the Applicant.\nb. For the Applicant.\nFactual support and reasons for the foregoing are set forth in FINDINGS OF FACT and\nCONCLUSIONS, supra.\nDECISION\nIn light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.\nRichard A.

Her husband\nsaves approximately 15% each pay period and she saves approximately 10% of her pay. With their\ncontinued savings they anticipate having a healthy financial safety net in the event of an unexpected\nemergency.6\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  As Commander in Chief, the President has\n7\n\u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine\nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person\naccess to such information.\u201d  The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee\n8\nto grant applicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of\n9\ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance.\u201d  \u201cThe clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should\n10\nerr, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should\n11\nbe allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such sensitive\ninformation.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a\n12\ndetermination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not\n13\nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a\nclearance.14\nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal\nor professional history of the applicant which disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being\n\nSee Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.\n15\nSee v.

An applicant \u201chas\n18\nthe ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nor continue his security clearance.\u201d  \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must,\n19\non the side of denial.\u201d20\nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those\nwhich would mitigate security concerns, pertaining to the adjudicative guideline, are set forth and\ndiscussed in the conclusions below. \nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all facts in evidence and the legal standards discussed above. I\nreach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the SOR.\nBased upon consideration of the evidence, I find the following adjudicative guideline most\npertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case:\nFinancial Considerations\nFinancial Considerations are a security concern because failure or inability to live within\none\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual\nwho is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nCompulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes including espionage. Affluence\nthat cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a security concern. It may indicate\nproceeds from financially profitable criminal acts. \nBased on all of the evidence, Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC)\n19(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and FC DC 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial\n\n5\nobligations), apply in this case. Applicant had debts that were delinquent and she was unable to\nsatisfy them in a timely manner.\nI have considered all of the Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC), and\nespecially considered FC MC 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment), FC MC 20(b) (the conditions\nthat resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances), FC MC 20(c) (the\nperson has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications\nthat the problem is being resolved or is under control), and FC MC 20(d) (the individual initiated\na good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts). Applicant has paid all but\none of her delinquent debts. The remaining debt is on a repayment plan that she is paying. Applicant\nand her husband ran into financial problems when they had their first child and he lost his job.\nDuring this period they got behind in debts. They are now both employed in good jobs and have\ntaken two loans to repay their delinquent debts. They are repaying their loans and it appears they\nhave a solid financial plan. I find FC MC 20(a) and (c) apply in that the conditions and behavior that\nresulted in their financial problems are unlikely to recur and were beyond their control. In addition,\nunder the circumstances they acted responsibly. They obtained reasonable loans satisfying most of\ntheir debts and have affordable repayment plans for their remaining debt and their loans. They are\nsaving money and have a financial safety net if an unexpected expense occurs. Applicant made a\ngood-faith effort to repay her creditors, and I find she has repaid all of them except one, which is on\na repayment plan. In addition, there are clear indications that Applicant\u2019s financial problems are in\nthe past. Therefore, I find FC MC 20(c) and (d) also apply.\nThe Whole Person Analysis\nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The\nobjective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a person\u2019s\nlife to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance. Indeed,\nthe adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in considering the \u201cwhole\nperson\u201d concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of their acts, omissions,\nmotivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful\nanalysis.\nIn addition to considering the specific disqualifying and mitigating conditions under the\nGuidelines, I have also considered the adjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6 2a (1)-(9) of the\nGuidelines to be considered in evaluating a person\u2019s eligibility to hold a security clearance.\nSpecifically these are: (1) the nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nand surrounding the conduct to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency\nof the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation was voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. Although the presence\nor absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative,\nthe Guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance.\n\n6\nI considered all evidence provided and also considered the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept in\nevaluating Applicant\u2019s risk and vulnerability in protecting our national interests. Applicant and her\nhusband ran into financial problems when he lost his job around the same time they had a baby. She\ntook a loan against her 401k pension plan and a credit union loan and paid their creditors. They have\nan affordable repayment plan and both are working and saving a portion of their income. I find\nApplicant has mitigated the security concerns raised by financial considerations concerns. Therefore,\nI am persuaded by the totality of the evidence in this case, that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. Accordingly, Guideline F is decided for\nApplicant.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1\nFinancial Considerations (Guideline F)\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.-1.i:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. Clearance is\ngranted. \nCarol. G. Ricciardello\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Crowley, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n                              \n______________\nDecision\n______________\nHENRY, Mary E., Administrative Judge:\nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony,  I\nconcluded that Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information must be\ngranted.\nApplicant prepared his Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on January 6,\n2005 and executed it on March 10, 2005. On November 5, 2007, the Defense Office of\nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the\nsecurity concerns under Guidelines J and E for Applicant. The action was taken under\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February\n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended\n(Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President\non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs\nissued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApril 22, 2008\n\nApplicant\u2019s undated response to the SOR, received on January 3, 2008.\n1\nGE 1 (Applicant\u2019s security clearance application, dated January 6, 2005 and executed on March 10, 2005)\n2\nat 1-2; Tr. 20-21.\nGE 1, supra note 1, at 2-4; Tr. 22-23.\n3\n2\nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on November 24, 2007. He\nanswered the SOR in writing and requested a hearing before an administrative judge.\nDOHA received the request on January 3, 2008. Department Counsel was prepared to\nproceed on January 22, 2008, and I received the case assignment on January 30, 2008.\nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on February 12, 2008, and I convened the hearing as\nscheduled on March 6, 2008. The government offered five exhibits, (GE) 1 through 5,\nwhich were received and admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant and one\nwitness testified. He submitted two exhibits, (AE) A and B, which were received and\nadmitted into evidence without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing\n(Tr.) on March 18, 2008. I held the record open until March 20, 2008, for Applicant to\nsubmit additional matters.  On March 18, 2008, he submitted seven exhibits, AE C\nthrough I, which were received and admitted without objection. The record closed on\nMarch 20, 2008.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d\nof the SOR. He denied the intentional falsification as alleged in \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b of the\nSOR.   \n1\nApplicant is 41 years old. He works for a Department of Defense contractor as a\nproduction manager in the shop and a team leader in the field. Applicant is a welder by\ntrade and has worked for his current employer for five years, initially working as a\nwelder.2\nApplicant married eight years ago. He and his wife do not have children. They\nseparated seven months ago. His wife has two daughters, who are his step-daughters\nand are ages 17 and 19. His 17-year-old son from another relationship lives with him.3\nAs a teenager, Applicant spent time with friends, whom he describes as the\n\u201cwrong crowd\u201d. In 1985, at age 20, the police arrested and charged Applicant with grand\nlarceny, possession of drug paraphernalia, and possession of marijuana. The court\nsuspended his initial sentence of five years and placed him on 12 months probation.\nWhile on probation, the police again arrested and charged him with possession of\nmarijuana with intent to distribute, a felony, in May 1987. The prosecutor reduced the\ncharge to simple possession of marijuana, a misdemeanor, and the court sentenced\nhim to 120 days in jail. Because of his second arrest, the court revoked his probation\nand reinstated his five year jail sentence, suspending four years. Applicant entered\nprison on November 4, 1987. The prison released him on February 22, 1989, and nine\n\nGE 2 (United States Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigation, criminal records, dated October\n4\n13, 2005) at 3; GE 3 (Letter, from State Department of Corrections, dated August 24, 2007) at 1; GE 5\n(Interrogatories and answers, dated September 10, 2007) at 3-4; Tr. at 24-29.\nGE 2, supra note 4, at 4; Tr. 29-30.\n5\nGE 2, supra note 4, at 4; GE 4 (Interrogatories and answers, dated September 10, 2007) at 3; Tr 31-32.\n6\nGE 1, supra note 2, at 5-6.\n7\n3\nmonths later, the Corrections Department discharged him from parole. Applicant has not\nbeen arrested for similar criminal conduct since his release from prison.4\nIn October 1997, he and his girlfriend, now estranged wife, argued, as they often\ndid. They argued heatedly on some occasions and this was one occasion. He eventually\npushed her and she called the police, who charged him with assault and battery. The\ncourt sentenced him to 30 days in jail, which was suspended, and fined him.  \n5\nIn 2004, Applicant and his wife got into yet another argument, which got out of\ncontrol. When he came home from work, his wife started arguing with him and got into\nhis face. He told her to move back, but she didn\u2019t. The arguing continued and\neventually, he shoved her, causing her to fall and hit her arm. The police arrested and\ncharged him with assault and battery. The court convicted him of assault, sentenced\nhim to 60 days in jail, suspended, and fined him. No drugs or alcohol were involved in\nthis incident. Applicant and his wife continued to argue and, as he states, regularly \u201cbutt\nheads\u201d on a variety of issues. Because of their continuous arguing, Applicant now seeks\na divorce as he does not want to lose his freedom.6\nApplicant prepared his security clearance application (SF 86) on January 6,\n2005. He answered \u201cyes\u201d to each of the following questions:7\nQuestion 21. Your Police Record - Felony Offenses\nHave you ever been charged with or convicted of any felony\noffense? (Include those under the Uniform Code of Military\nJustice.) For this item, report information regardless of\nwhether the record in your case has been \u201csealed\u201d or\notherwise stricken from the record. The single exception to\nthis requirement is for certain convictions under the Federal\nControlled Substances Act for which the court issued an\nexpungement order under the authority of 21 U.S.C. 844 or\n18 U.S.C. 3607. The question asks for the date, nature of\noffense, action, authority or court, city and state, and county.\nIn response to this question, Applicant listed his 1985 arrest and original\nsentence by the court. He did not list his subsequent time in prison. When the police\narrested him in 1987 for a marijuana offense, the court sentenced him to 12 months and\n\nId. at 5; Tr. 33-34. I note that the criminal records report does not contain clear and correct information about\n8\nApplicant\u2019s criminal history. See GE 2, supra note 4.\nGE 1, supra note 2, at 6; Tr. 34-35.\n9\nTr. 39-47; AE A through C (Customer letters); AE D through AE I are his performance evaluations from 2003\n10\nuntil December 2007.\n4\ntwo days in prison for his 1985 conviction as a result of his violation of probation. Since\nhe prefers not to remember the details of his past criminal conduct, he obtained a copy\nof his arrest record from the local police department before completing the questions on\nhis SF-86. This report listed the charges and his sentence, but not his prison time,\nwhich he does not deny he served. In his answer to Question 24, he did list his arrest\nfor marijuana in 1987 and indicated that he spent 4 months in jail. He also spent time in\na detention home as a teenager.8\nQuestion 26. Your Police Record - Other Offenses\nIn the last seven years, have you ever been arrested for\ncharged with or convicted of any offense(s) not listed in\nmodules 21, 22, 23, 24, or 25? (Leave out traffic fines of less\nthan $150 unless the violation was alcohol or drug related.)\nFor this item, report information regardless of whether the\nrecord in your case has been \u201csealed\u201d or otherwise stricken\nfrom the record. The single exception to this requirement is\nfor certain convictions under the Federal Controlled\nSubstances Act for which the court issued an expungement\norder under the authority of 21 U.S.C. 844 or 18 U.S.C.\n3607. The question also asks for the date, nature of offense,\naction, authority or court, city and state, and county.\nApplicant listed his 1997 arrest for assault and battery, but did not list his more\nrecent arrest for the same charges in 2004. He has no explanation for this failure,\nexcept that maybe it slipped his mind. He denies that he intentionally failed to list this\ninformation.9\nApplicant\u2019s second-line supervisor, who is manager of Applicant\u2019s department,\ntestified on his behalf. His second-line supervisor describes Applicant as a good worker,\nand an honest and trustworthy employee. Applicant works well with others and with\ncustomers, both of whom respect him. Customers have provided written letters of\ncommendation, noting Applicant\u2019s reliability and performance. Applicant has always\nbeen trustworthy about the company\u2019s jobs and processes. Applicant needs a clearance\nfor general access, not to work on classified information or sensitive material, which is\nnot available to him. His performance appraisals reflect his good performance.10\n\n5\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the administrative\njudge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief\nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially\ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of\nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the\nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair,\nimpartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a\nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d\nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship transcends\nnormal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government reposes a\nhigh degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to classified\ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the\nApplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the\nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n\nAt the hearing, the government withdrew allegation 1.e. because of the recent repeal of 10 U.S.C. 986. In\n11\nlight of the government\u2019s withdrawal, I need not discuss disqualifying condition AG \u00b6 31(f). The remaining\ndisqualifying condition are not applicable in this case.\n6\nAnalysis\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct, \u201cCriminal\nactivity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its\nvery nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws,\nrules and regulations.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 31, the following disqualifying condition could raise a security\nconcern in this case:\n(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses.11\nThe police arrested and charged Applicant in 1985 and 1987 for various types of\ncriminal conduct, including with grand larceny and possession of marijuana, for which\nhe served time in jail. The police also arrested him twice for assault and battery. The\ngovernment has established that the above disqualifying condition applies.\nUnder AG \u00b6 32, the following mitigating conditions may mitigate the government\u2019s\nsecurity concerns:\n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment;\n(b) the person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those\npressures are no longer present in the person's life;\n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited\nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or\nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or\nconstructive community involvement.\nAfter his release from jail in February 1989, the Applicant has not been arrested\nfor any criminal conduct related to theft, burglary, drugs or alcohol. While in prison, he\nattended welding courses, which provided him a skill and subsequent employment. He\nlong ago stopped associating with his past criminal friends. His employer praises his\nwork ethic and skills, and considers him a valued employee. Applicant has mitigated\nallegations 1.a and 1.b by the passage of time and by a successful change in his\nconduct, work habits and friends. AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and 32(d) applies.\n\n7\nApplicant\u2019s two later arrests arose out of a domestic situation. He and his\nestranged wife fought regularly over many issues. Sometimes, their arguments\nescalated out of control. On many occasions, he left the marital home. However, on two\noccasions, seven years apart, Applicant pushed his wife away from him. She fell and, at\nleast once, hurt her arm. One these occasions, the last of which occurred more than 3\n\u00bd years ago, she called the police, which lead to his arrest and conviction for\nmisdemeanor assault. Applicant and his wife are now separated, largely because he\ndoes not want to be arrested another time for assault and battery because of their\narguing. Given this change in his living situation, he is not confronted on a regular basis\nwith his wife\u2019s anger. There is little likelihood that this conduct, of which he is not proud,\nwill reoccur. His second-line supervisor knows that Applicant protects the jobs and\nprocesses of the company and trusts him to protect this information. Mitigating\nconditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and 32(b) are applicable.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct as\n\u201cConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness\nto comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual's reliability,\ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Of special interest is any\nfailure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or\nany other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\u201d\nThe following will normally result in an unfavorable clearance action or\nadministrative termination of further processing for clearance eligibility:\n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or cooperate\nwith security processing, including but not limited to meeting with a\nsecurity investigator for subject interview, completing security forms or\nreleases, and cooperation with medical or psychological evaluation; and,\n(b) refusal to provide full, frank and truthful answers to lawful questions of\ninvestigators, security officials, or other official representatives in\nconnection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination.\nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying:\n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from\nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or\nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.\nThe government established that Applicant omitted material facts from his SF-86\nwhen he answered \u201cyes\u201d to Questions 21 and 26 about his police record. This\n\nSee ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov.17, 2004)(explaining holding in ISCR Case No. 02-23133\n12\nat 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004)).\n8\ninformation is material to the evaluation of Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness to hold a security\nclearance and to his honesty. For this guideline to apply, Applicant\u2019s omission must be\ndeliberate. He denies, however, that he deliberately falsified his answer to these\nquestions. When a falsification allegation is controverted, the government has the\nburden of proving it. Proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove\nan applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the omission occurred. An administrative\njudge must consider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is\ndirect or circumstantial evidence concerning an applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the\ntime the omission occurred.  For DC \u00b6 16 (a) to apply, the government must establish\n12\nthat Applicant\u2019s omission, concealment or falsification in his answer was deliberate.\nApplicant credibly testified that he prefers not to continually remind himself about\nhis bad conduct as a youth. Because he has pushed from his immediate memory many\nof the facts related to his early arrests, he obtained a copy of his police record from the\nlocal police department. He relied on this record information to answer Question 21 and\nQuestion 24. In his answer to Question 24, he indicated that he spent 4 months in jail,\nbut listed only the suspended sentence given to him by the court in Question 21. His\nanswers to both questions reflect that the information he provided was based on the\npolice report he obtained. Thus, he did not deliberately and intentionally falsify his\nanswer to Question 21. The government has not established allegation 2.a of the SOR.\nConcerning Applicant\u2019s failure to list his arrest for assault and battery in August\n2004 in his answer to Question 26, Applicant could not provide any reason for his failure\nto acknowledge this arrest. Because he listed the 1997 arrest, which occurred more\nthan seven years earlier, his failure to list an arrest which happened seven months\nbefore he completed his SF-86 and was still in the court system was deliberate. The\ngovernment has established its case in regards to allegation 2.b of the SOR.\nAG \u00b6 17 provides several conditions which may mitigate the government\u2019s\nsecurity concerns regarding Applicant\u2019s falsification of his answer to Question 26. None\nof the mitigating conditions are applicable, except possibly AG \u00b6 17(e):\n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate\nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress.\nApplicant acknowledged his 2004 arrest when he met with the investigator and at\nthe hearing. In so doing, he has reduced his vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation or\nduress because of this arrest. He is not required to tell everyone about this arrest\nstemming from his marital problems. He is, however, required to make the government\naware of any arrests within the time frame required by questions on the SF-86. Thus, I\nfind that this mitigating condition may have some applicability.\n\n9\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n\u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and\nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;\n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. When these problems first began,\nApplicant was a young man. (See AG \u00b6 2(a)(4).) He chose friends, \u201cthe wrong crowd\u201d,\nand followed their lead by using drugs and committing criminal acts, until he served time\nin prison. (See AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a)(1), (2), and (5).) While in prison, he learned a trade. Since\nleaving prison, he has worked steadily and has chosen new friends. He no longer\nparticipates in the criminal activities of his youth. (See AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a)(3), (6).)\nApplicant\u2019s two arrests for assault and battery arose because of his often\ncontentious relationship with his estranged wife. On these two occasions, their arguing\nescalated out of control and he shoved his wife, conduct he regrets. Because the\narguing continues, he decided to divorce his wife. He no longer lives with her. He does\nnot want to lose his freedom because of their relationship. (See AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a)(3), (6) and\n(7).).\nHis early arrests occurred more than 20 years ago. During his time in prison, he\nreflected on his behavior and changed it after his release from prison. There is little\nlikelihood this type of conduct will occur in the future. His first assault and battery arrest\nis over 10 years old. His second assault and battery arrest is more than 3 \u00bd years old.\nRecognizing that he and his estranged wife continued to argue and that their arguing\ncould lead to further arrests if their emotions got out of control, Applicant decided to end\nhis marriage to preserve his freedom. Since he has removed himself from this\nenvironment, he has significantly reduced the likelihood that he will be arrested for this\nconduct again. (See AG \u00b6 2(a)(9).).\n\n10\nApplicant has an excellent work record. His supervisors, customers, and co-\nworkers respect and trust him because he is reliable and a good performer. He learned\nfrom his prison experience. Since he cannot change the dynamics of his relationship\nwith his estranged wife, he ended it. His decision not to reveal his 2004 arrest showed a\nlapse in judgment, which is contrary to his usual good judgment in the work place and in\nother parts of his life. Because he has acknowledged this arrest, his failure to reveal it\ninitially cannot be used to coerce, pressure or exploit him, particular since he has other\nacknowledged criminal conduct. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his criminal and\npersonal conduct. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 1, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                                              \nMARY E. HENRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",
