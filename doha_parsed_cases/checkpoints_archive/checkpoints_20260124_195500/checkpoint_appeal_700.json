Applicant did not submit a response to \nthe FORM.

From 2008 through 2013, he attended ITT Technical \nInstitute (ITT). The gravamen of the SOR is delinquent student loan debt from that period\u201514 \ndelinquent student loans totaling about $101,200. Of the 14 student loans, 12 were Department of \nEducation (DoE) loans and 2 were private loans from PEAKS, ITT\u2019s in-house student loan \nprogram. In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations.  \nIn his findings of fact, the Judge incorporated two articles published in the Washington \nPost in September 2020 and August 2022 that were not offered into evidence. Those articles, \nquoted at length in the decision, recited the troubled history of ITT/PEAKS, to include lawsuits \nbrought by students and Federal agencies, the resulting settlements, and the Federal government\u2019s \nseries of remedial actions, which culminated in DoE\u2019s announcement on August 16, 2022 that it \nwas discharging \u201call remaining federal student loans that borrowers received to attend [ITT Tech] \nfrom January 1, 2005, through its closure in September 2016.\u201d washingtonpost.com/education/ \n2022/08/16/itt-tech-student-loan-forgiveness, quoted in Decision at 5.

[Decision at 7.] \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s challenges to the Judge\u2019s reliance on the newspaper articles vary in \nmerit. First, she argues that the Judge erred in that he \u201csua sponte obtained, considered and relied \nupon non-record evidence from a non-authoritative source.\u201d Appeal Brief at 6. As Department \nCounsel concedes, it is permissible for an Administrative Judge to take sua sponte administrative \nnotice, including after close of the record. See also ISCR Case No. 17-03026 at 4, n. 4 (App. Bd. \nJan. 16, 2019).  However, she argues, the Judge should not have taken administrative notice from \na \u201cnon-authoritative source.\u201d This argument is grounded in Appeal Board precedent, which \npermits administrative notice to be taken of, inter alia, official documents posted by Federal \ndepartments or agencies on their websites. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 99-0452 at 4 n.7 (App. Bd. \nMar. 21, 2000). See also ISCR. Case No. 02-06478 at 4\u20135 (App. Bd. Dec. 15, 2003) for a lengthier \ndiscussion on administrative notice.  \nBecause Directive \u00b6 E3.1.19 provides that the Federal Rules of Evidence shall serve as a \nguide in DOHA proceedings, it is helpful to examine how Federal courts handle requests to take \njudicial notice of facts in a newspaper article.  In general, Federal courts have held that newspaper \nand online articles are not normally the kinds of evidence of which courts take judicial notice. \nHowever, Federal courts may take judicial notice of a newspaper article if the proponent \ndemonstrates that \u201cthe facts of the article are either \u2018(1) generally known within the territorial \njurisdiction of the trial court or (2) capable of accurate and ready determination by resort to sources \nwhose accuracy cannot be reasonably questioned\u2019 as required under Rule 201(b) of the Federal \nRules of Evidence.\u201d Kress v. United States, 382 F.Supp. 3d 820, 830 (E.D. Wis. 2019), citing In \nre Am. Apparel, Inc. Shareholder Litigation, 855 F.Supp. 2d 1043, 1063 (C.D. Cal. 2012) (quoting \nHardison v. Newland, No. C984517CRB(PR), 2003 WL 23025432 at 5 (N.D. Cal. Dec. 17, 2003). \nSee also Davidson Oil Co. v. City of Albuquerque, 545 F.Supp. 3d 1039, 1044 (D. N.M. 2021) \n(\u201cJudicial notice of newspaper articles is not appropriate . . . when the reported facts are not capable \nof easy verification.\u201d). In short, a DOHA Judge may take administrative notice of a newspaper \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n     \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \narticle when the reported facts are easily verifiable through a reliable source. In taking such \nadministrative notice, the Judge should explain the basis for concluding the facts are easily \nverifiable and, if practical, enter into the record copies of the reliable sources that verify pertinent \nfacts. \nIn this case, the Washington Post article of August 16, 2022, was apparently based on a \nDoE press release of that same date. See https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/education\u00ad\ndepartment-approves-39-billion-group-discharge-208000-borrowers-who-attended-itt-technical\u00ad\ninstitute. Consequently, the facts in that article were easily verifiable through a reliable source. \nOf course, the better practice would have been for the Judge to take administrative notice of the \nFederal agency (i.e., DoE) press release\u2e3aa recognized source for taking administrative \nnotice\u2015rather than indirectly relying on a secondary source, i.e., the Washington Post article. \nDepartment Counsel next argues that the Judge erred by drawing \u201ca speculative legal \nconclusion that an unidentified loan-forgiveness program applied to Applicant\u2019s student loans.\u201d \nAppeal Brief at 6. Contrary to her assertion, we note that this was not \u201can unidentified loan-\nforgiveness program.\u201d As mentioned above, the Federal program made national news, was clearly \nidentified in the Washington Post article quoted in the decision, and was easily verifiable on the \nDoE website. On the other hand, the Judge\u2019s reliance on the Washington Post article of September \n15, 2020, addressing the forgiveness of the PEAKS loans is not easily verifiable.  Since the Judge \nwas taking administrative notice, sua sponte, of that article, he should have demonstrated that the \npertinent facts in the article were capable of accurate and ready determination by resort to sources \nwhose accuracy cannot be reasonably questioned. The Judge erred in taking administrative notice \nof the article without providing a sufficient foundation.  \nThis error highlights the most fundamental problem with the Judge\u2019s approach\u2015he failed \nto give the parties notice of his intent to take administrative notice and an opportunity to respond, \nas is required by Appeal Board precedent. See, e.g., DISCR Case No. 90-1550 at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. \n25, 1992); ISCR Case No. 20-02266 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 21, 2022). This requirement is \nparticularly crucial in a case where, as here, pivotal events occur after a hearing or after submission \nof a FORM. The landscape of this case changed dramatically on August 16, 2022, a month after \nDepartment Counsel prepared and submitted the FORM. \nEven if the Judge could take \nadministrative notice of the Washington Post article of DoE press release, the parties were entitled \nto be informed of that determination and given the opportunity to re-shape their evidence and \narguments. In failing to give them notice and opportunity to respond, the Judge erred. \nAdditionally, the Judge erred in failing to enter copies of the two Washington Post articles \ninto the record. In the past, the Board held that a Judge erred by merely citing a document\u2019s \nInternet Uniform Resource Locater (URL) in taking administrative notice is insufficient due to the \ndynamic nature of the Internet. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 00-0628 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 26, 2002); \nISCR Case No. 02-24875 at 4, n.3 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2006); ADP Case No. 14-01655 at 2 (App. \nBd. Nov. 3, 2015); ISCR Case No. 17-01962 at 4, n.4 (App. Bd. Oct. 25, 2018); and ISCR Case \nNo. 20-02266 at 2. In this case, the Judge should have entered copies of the Washington Post \narticles into the record to facilitate review on appeal. By failing to enter those articles into record, \nthe Judge\u2019s findings of fact regarding them are not based on record evidence.    \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWe turn finally to Department Counsel\u2019s argument that the Judge abandoned his \nimpartiality and \u201cinstead became a surrogate and advocate for the Applicant when he sua sponte \nintroduced and considered facts not in evidence without providing the parties notice and an \nopportunity to respond.\u201d Appeal Brief at 7. To the extent that Applicant is arguing that the Judge \nwas biased, we do not find that argument convincing. There is a rebuttable presumption that a \nJudge is impartial and unbiased, and a party seeking to overcome that presumption has a heavy \nburden of persuasion. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 18-02722 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 30, 2020).  The test \nis whether the record contains any indication the Judge acted in a manner that would lead a \nreasonable person to question his fairness and impartiality of the Judge.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n20-02787 at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 9, 2022). \nHere, the Judge took sua sponte notice of facts that were reported in national news, easily \nverifiable, and incontrovertible\u2015that the Federal government had forgiven the remaining Federal \nstudent loan debts associated with Applicant\u2019s alma mater. Although the Judge erred in how he \ntook administrative notice of facts, the record contains nothing that would lead a reasonable person \nto question the Judge\u2019s fairness and impartiality.    \nBased on the foregoing, we conclude the best resolution is to remand this case for the Judge \nto reopen the record, provide the parties any documents on which he intends to rely for taking \nadministrative notice, and give them an opportunity to submit additional evidence or argument. \nOn remand, the Judge is required to issue a new decision. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.35. The Board retains \nno continuing jurisdiction over a remanded decision. However, a Judge\u2019s decision issued after \nremand may be appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28. and E3.1.30. \nOrder \nThe decision is REMANDED. \nSigned: James F. Duffy \nJames F.

Tr. at 59-60 and 64-65. Three times in the decision, the Judge noted \nthat Applicant did not provide any proof of payments towards new payment agreements. Decision \nat 4, 7, and 8. For example: the Judge stated: \nHis five settlement agreements with SOR creditors \u00b6\u00b6 1.d-1.f and 1.h-1.i did not \ninclude any upfront payments to season his agreement . . . Without more payment \ndocumentation on Applicant\u2019s settled accounts, these accounts still reflect \nunfulfilled promises to pay off the agreed settlement amounts in the future, and \ncannot at this time be credited as fully verified resolved debts. \n. \n. \n. \nPayment agreements alone that are not accompanied by material good-faith \npayments still reflect promises to pay that do not meet the good-faith payment \nrequirements of [Mitigating Condition] 20(d). [Id. at 7\u20138.] \nIn his appeal brief, Applicant asserts that he made initial payments under all five payment \nagreements, that he provided proof of those payments in his post-hearing e-mail submission, and \nthat the Judge erred in finding otherwise. Applicant provided a copy of all material submitted post-\nhearing by email to the Judge, with screenshots of the files that were attached. \nFrom our review of the record, it appears that Applicant timely submitted six receipts for \npayments that were overlooked by the Judge. 1 Although there is a presumption that an \nadministrative judge has considered all of the record evidence, that presumption is rebutted \nwhere\u2014as here\u2014the judge states that the record lacked specific evidence that was in fact \nsubmitted. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-14950 at 6 (App. Bd. May 15, 2003). In light of the \nparticular facts of this case, especially the Judge\u2019s emphasis on the lack of any payments towards \nthe settlement agreements, we cannot conclude that this error was harmless, i.e., it did not likely \naffect the outcome of the case.

Applicant further challenges the Judge\u2019s finding that he did \n1 The record before the Board contains five of the receipts (one for each SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.f, and 1.h and two for 1.i) but \nis missing one receipt\u2014for a payment made towards the debt of SOR \u00b6 1.e.

For the following reasons, I disagree with my colleagues that \nremand is warranted and would instead affirm the Judge\u2019s decision. \n3\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBackground \nApplicant has been employed with the same Defense contractor since 2010. Decision at 3. \nAs of the hearing, his salary was approximately $100,000 annually. Decision at 4. In November \n2020, as part of his current security clearance request, Applicant completed a Security Clearance \nApplication (SCA) wherein he disclosed seven of the ten delinquent accounts that were ultimately \nalleged in the SOR. Government Exhibit (GE) 1 at 42-49. During his January 2021 subject \ninterview, he discussed all ten of the SOR debts, asserting that he was already making payments \non one (SOR \u00b6 1.g), and that he planned to contact the nine other lenders to negotiate payment \nplans. GE 4 at 2-3. On September 7, 2021, Applicant was issued an SOR that alleged delinquent \ndebt totaling over $45,000. More than a year later, the hearing was held on September 19, 2022, \nfollowing which the record was held open for 30 days for Applicant to provide additional \ndocuments in support of his case. On October 19, 2022, Applicant submitted additional material \nand the record closed. \nProof of Payments \nThe bulk of Applicant\u2019s argument on appeal is that the Judge erred in finding that Applicant \nfailed to make good faith payments for the debts alleged at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d-1.f, 1.h, and 1.i. Appeal \nBrief at 1-2. In his Decision, the Judge found that Applicant\u2019s post-hearing submission established \nthat he had entered payment agreements for those five SOR debts. Decision at 3-4. The Judge also \nfound, however, that the \u201cpayment agreements did not include any upfront good-faith payments,\u201d \nand that \u201c[w]ithout any accompanying payments with his agreements, [Applicant] was unable to \nestablish payment plans designed to produce good-faith track records of payments with these \ncreditors.\u201d Decision at 4.2 \nThe Judge\u2019s finding that Applicant failed to submit evidence of upfront payments pursuant \nto the five agreements was erroneous. Rather, the record reflects that Applicant submitted, and the \nJudge included in the record, evidence of the five agreements and the following five payments \nthereunder: \nSOR \u00b6 1.d: First payment made on October 1, 2022 (AE I) \nSOR \u00b6 1.f: First payment made on October 11, 2022 (AE L) \nSOR \u00b6 1.h: First payment made on September 30, 2022 (AE J) \nSOR \u00b6 1.i: First two payments made on September 30 and October 17, 2022 (AE K) \nAdditionally, Applicant\u2019s appeal reflects that he included a sixth document in his post-hearing \nsubmission that was inadvertently excluded from the record, and which indicates that Applicant \nmade a first payment for the debt alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.e on September 26, 2022. Appeal Brief at 15. \nThose six payments total approximately $600. \n2 The Judge also found that Applicant had resolved the debt alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.j, but that the debts alleged at SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c and 1.g remained unresolved for various reasons. Decision at 3-4. \n4\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIt is clear from the record that Applicant timely submitted evidence of six payments and \nthat those were subsequently overlooked by the Judge. I believe, however, that the Judge\u2019s failure \nto consider Applicant\u2019s post-hearing payments was harmless error. Error is harmless if: 1) there is \nnot a significant chance that, but for the error, the Judge would have reached a different result; or \n2) there is not a significant chance that the error fatally affects an otherwise sustainable decision. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 00-0250 at 6 (App. Bd. Jul. 11, 2001). The timing and scope of \nApplicant\u2019s resolution efforts, even considering the six payments, could not rise to a good faith \neffort to repay his debts sufficient to mitigate the Government\u2019s concern and therefore the Judge\u2019s \ndecision is sustainable. \nTiming \nThe Appeal Board has consistently held that the \u201ctiming of the resolution of financial \nproblems is an important factor in evaluating an applicant\u2019s case for mitigation because an \napplicant who begins to resolve financial problems only after being placed on notice that his \nclearance was in jeopardy may lack the judgment and self-discipline to follow rules and regulations \nover time or when there is no immediate threat to his own interests.\u201d See ISCR Case No. 15-06440 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 26, 2017). Applicant has known about most of the debts at issue since at least \nNovember 2020 when he disclosed seven of them in his SCA. He discussed all of them during his \nsecurity clearance interview in January 2021 and understood that the financial concerns would be \naddressed at hearing when he received Notice of the same on September 8, 2022. Yet he took no \nsteps to resolve most of the accounts until the eve of or, more typically, after his security clearance \nhearing. The timing of his efforts would therefore impact minimally on mitigation. \nMeaningful Track Record \nMore significant in this case, however, is Applicant\u2019s track record of payments. The Board \nhas held that until an applicant has a \u201cmeaningful financial track record it cannot be said as a matter \nof law that he has initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve \ndebts.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-21386 at 3 (App. Bd. Jun. 11, 2003). The concept of \u201c\u2018meaningful track \nrecord\u2019 necessarily includes evidence of actual debt reduction through payment of debts.\u201d ISCR \nCase No. 05-01920 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 1, 2007). An applicant must demonstrate that he has \n\u201cestablished a plan to resolve his financial problems and taken significant actions to implement \nthat plan.\u201d ISCR Case No. 04-09684 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 6, 2006) (emphasis added). By close of \nthe record in this matter, Applicant made six of the total 180 monthly payments anticipated under \nhis five payment agreements. One or two payments towards a debt, all made after the hearing was \nheld, do not amount to significant action to implement his payment agreements, nor do they \nestablish the requisite \u201ctrack record.\u201d Having already considered the five underlying payment \nagreements when he concluded that Applicant\u2019s efforts failed to mitigate the Government\u2019s \nconcern, the Judge could not have concluded that the otherwise overlooked six initial payments \namounted to a meaningful track record sufficient to transform Applicant\u2019s efforts to good faith \nrepayment efforts and mitigating. \n5\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nUnder the harmless error standard cited, above, the Judge\u2019s failure to consider evidence of \nApplicant\u2019s six post-hearing payments would be harmless because there is not a significant chance \nthat the error fatally affected his otherwise sustainable decision. \nSecurity Clearance History \nApplicant next argues that the Judge incorrectly found that Applicant had never held a \nsecurity clearance. Appeal Brief at 2; Decision at 3. From the record evidence, it appears that \nApplicant has held a Secret clearance since 2011. See GE 1 at 41; Tr. at 33. To the extent that the \nJudge\u2019s finding regarding Applicant\u2019s security clearance history is an error, it does not appear to \nhave been decisive in the Judge\u2019s overall decision and, therefore, is harmless. \nFailure to Furnish Monthly Budget, Endorsements, or Performance Evaluations \nApplicant finally takes issue with the Judge\u2019s finding that he did not furnish a monthly \nbudget or performance evaluations because he testified about those matters at hearing and the \nJudge did not specifically request supporting documentation. Appeal Brief at 2. These arguments \nare without merit. \nWith respect to his monthly budget, the transcript reflects that when the Judge tried to \ndetermine the details of Applicant\u2019s expenses to ascertain his ability to repay his creditors, \nApplicant indicated that he was unsure about the specific amounts, had not revisited the subject \nsince receiving a promotion two months prior, and tried to provide a \u201crough estimate\u201d on the spot: \nJudge: \nWhat do you estimate for the remainder every month after paying all \nyour expenses right now? \nApplicant: Let me see can I run \u2013 I haven\u2019t run the numbers quite recently, since \nmy recent promotion. \nJudge: \nYou mentioned your rent, your car payment. But you estimate you have \nover each month that you could use to address on some of these \noutstanding debts that haven\u2019t been resolved. \nApplicant: Let me see here. I would say roughly -- I\u2019m going to take a shot and \nsay I would maybe have like $1,000 maybe, to take care of the \nremaining ones. This is a rough estimate right now without me actually \nhaving to actually sit down and break down all of my budgeting things \nitem-by-item. \nTr. at 34, 61-62. Estimates of a few monthly expenses do not amount to a budget or provide a \nreliable roadmap of an individual\u2019s ability to pay expenses. The Judge\u2019s ultimate finding that \n6\n\n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant did not furnish a budget, either at hearing or in his post-hearing materials, is therefore \nnot erroneous. \nFinally, with respect to evidence of Applicant\u2019s work performance, the only times that \nthese matters were discussed at hearing were when Applicant disclosed having recently received \na promotion (Tr. at 31, 34-35) and discussed his performance reviews in conjunction with \nanticipated bonuses (Tr. at 45). In DOHA proceedings, it is the applicant\u2019s responsibility to present \n\u201cevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by \nDepartment Counsel.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. Neither the Judge nor Department Counsel are \nobligated to identify or present evidence in support of Applicant\u2019s case for mitigation. See, e.g., \nISCR Case No. 15-04003 at 3 (App. Bd. May 25, 2017). \nAccordingly, I dissent from the Majority Opinion that remand is necessary in this case. \nSigned: Allison Marie \nAllison Marie \nAdministrative Judge \nMember, Appeal Board \n7\n",

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nBrittany D. Forrester, Esq. \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nAugust 31, 2021, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis of that \ndecision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of DoD Directive \n5220.6 (January 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive) and the National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines (AG) in Appendix A of Security Executive Agent Directive 4, effective June 8, 2017. \nApplicant requested a hearing. On March 31, 2023, after close of the record, Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals Administrative Judge Marc E. Curry denied Applicant\u2019s request for a \nsecurity clearance. Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nThe SOR alleged ten delinquent consumer and tax debts and was amended at hearing to \nallege an additional tax delinquency. The Judge found favorably for Applicant on eight allegations \nand adversely on the other three. Applicant raises the following issue on appeal\u2014whether the \nJudge failed to consider all the evidence, rendering his adverse decision arbitrary, capricious, or \ncontrary to law. Consistent with the following, we affirm. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant is in his mid-forties and married with two minor children. He served in the \nmilitary from 1996 through 2002, was honorably discharged, and has held a security clearance \nsince 2006. \nThe three debts resolved adversely to Applicant include a deficiency of approximately \n$10,000 for a car that was repossessed in 2016, delinquent state taxes of approximately $8,200 for \ntax years (TYs) 2010 and 2011, and a federal tax debt of $3,000 for TY 2020. Applicant contacted \nthe creditor regarding the auto debt in approximately 2021, but was subsequently advised that the \nfile was closed and collection activity had ceased. In January 2020, Applicant entered into a \npayment agreement with his state to satisfy the tax delinquency, but has not made consistent \npayments. Regarding the federal tax debt for TY 2020, Applicant had not entered into a payment \nplan at the time of the hearing. The Judge concluded that the three unresolved debts remain of \nsecurity concern: \nSpecifically, Applicant chose to eschew his payment agreement with his \nstate tax authority to pay his delinquent 2010 and 2011 taxes, in favor of purchasing \nluxury items, including multiple vacations and the recent purchase of an $82,000 \npersonal vehicle. Furthermore, his decision to enroll in financial counseling a week \nbefore the hearing does not mitigate the underlying security concern. Ultimately, \nApplicant\u2019s satisfaction of many of the debts, and his investigation into the status \nof some of his other debts [is mitigating] for those debts, but is insufficient to carry \nthe burden, when considered in tandem with the circumstances surrounding how \nApplicant incurred the debts and how long the state tax debts have been delinquent. \n[Decision at 6.] \nDiscussion \nIn his appeal brief, Applicant does not challenge any of the Judge\u2019s specific findings of \nfact. Rather, he contends the Judge failed to adhere to Executive Order 10865 and the Directive by \nnot considering all of the record evidence and by not properly applying the mitigating conditions. \nFor example, Applicant argues that the Judge did not give appropriate weight under AG \u00b6 20(c)1 \nto his recent credit counseling \u201csolely due to the timeframe\u201d and asserts that \u201c[i]t should not matter \nwhen [Applicant] received financial counseling.\u201d Appeal Brief at 12.

He served in the National Guard from 2004 until 2014, during which time he deployed twice to the Middle East in support of U.S. military objectives. He holds an 80% disability rating from the VA. Divorced, he has a child from his former marriage. Applicant has experienced problems with alcohol, due in part from post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) resulting from his combat tours. He was twice convicted of DWI, once in 2016 and again in 2019, his sentence for the latter conviction including probation that ends in March 2023.

On \nOctober 5, 2021, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that \ndecision\u2e3asecurity concerns raised under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption), Guideline J \n(Criminal Conduct), and Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of DoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, \n1992, as amended) (Directive). Applicant requested a hearing. On November 15, 2022, after the \nhearing, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Edward W. \nLoughran denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. Applicant appealed pursuant to \nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was \narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law insofar as it ran contrary to the weight of the record \nevidence. The Judge\u2019s favorable findings under Guideline F are not at issue in this appeal.  \nConsistent with the following, we affirm. \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nThe Judge\u2019s Findings and Analysis \nApplicant has worked for his current employer, a Defense contractor, since 2017. He \nserved in the National Guard from 2004 until 2014, during which time he deployed twice to the \nMiddle East in support of U.S. military objectives. He holds an 80% disability rating from the \nVA.  Divorced, he has a child from his former marriage. \nApplicant has experienced problems with alcohol, due in part from post traumatic stress \ndisorder (PTSD) resulting from his combat tours. He was twice convicted of DWI, once in 2016 \nand again in 2019, his sentence for the latter conviction including probation that ends in March \n2023. After the 2019 incident, Applicant entered into a treatment program managed by the VA. \nHis therapist stated that he had made significant progress, had developed coping strategies for \nmanaging his urge for alcohol, and had displayed an awareness of how alcohol had damaged his \nwellbeing. He underwent another VA program, this one monitored by the court as part of his \nprobation.  He graduated in March 2022 and completed aftercare the following October. \nApplicant initially testified that he had abstained from alcohol since March 2021. \nHowever, he subsequently admitted that he had consumed alcohol in June 2022, in violation of his \nprobation. He stated that he had experienced \u201csignificant stressors,\u201d including a death in the \nfamily, and had consumed about four beers. Decision at 3. As a consequence of his relapse, the \ncourt imposed additional monitoring. The Judge stated that he would consider this non-alleged \nmisconduct on the issue of mitigation. Applicant has been abstinent ever since. \nThe Judge noted evidence of Applicant\u2019s PTSD and stated that he gave considerable weight \nto his service to the U.S. He also noted the counseling that Applicant had received and that his \nmost recent offense occurred three years before the hearing. However, he cited to evidence that \nApplicant remains on probation until early 2023 and that he had violated the terms of that probation \nby consuming alcohol. The Judge stated that he had lingering doubts about Applicant\u2019s eligibility \nand suitability for a security clearance. \nDiscussion \nApplicant\u2019s appeal brief includes matters from outside the record, including character \nreferences. We are not permitted to consider new evidence on appeal. Directive \u204b E3.1.29. In \npresenting his appeal arguments, Applicant draws heavily upon the Adjudicative Desk Reference \n(ADR). However, DOHA Judges must decide cases based upon the Adjudicative Guidelines and \nthe record evidence, not the ADR. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-02253 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 28, \n2008). The ADR states, \u201cit is not U.S. Government policy and may not be cited as authority for \ndenial or revocation of access.\u201d ADR, Version 4, March 2014, at 2. The ADR is not controlling \nor determinative authority. \nThe gravamen of Applicant\u2019s argument on appeal is that his one instance of drinking \nfollowing his 2019 conviction and while on probation should not be determinative on the question \nof clearance eligibility. He argues that an isolated relapse is not unusual for persons in Applicant\u2019s \ncircumstances and does not outweigh Applicant\u2019s demonstrated efforts to address his problems. \nIn fact, the Judge made findings about such favorable things as Applicant\u2019s military service, the \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                       \n \nyears that had elapsed since his most recent offense, and the PTSD that was at the root of his \nmisconduct, addressing them in the course of his analysis. However, the Judge\u2019s reliance on \nApplicant\u2019s probation violation was not misplaced. In the past, we noted that resumption of \nsecurity-significant conduct in violation of probation requirements can undercut an applicant\u2019s \neffort to demonstrate rehabilitation. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 98-0223 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 29, \n1998). In the case before us, evidence that Applicant self-medicated with alcohol while on \nprobation could raise in a reasonable mind questions about his impulse control, which is a central \naspect of the Guideline G security concern. See Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u204b 21. Moreover, failure \nto comply with court-mandated abstinence bears upon the extent to which Applicant may be \nlacking in the ability or willingness to comply with rules and regulations. Such compliance is at \nthe heart of Guideline J. See Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u204b 30. Applicant\u2019s arguments on appeal \nconsist essentially of a disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, which is not \nenough to show that the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or \ncontrary to law. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 20-03646 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2022). Applicant\u2019s \narguments are not sufficient to undermine the Judge\u2019s decision. \nThe Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for \nthe decision. Applicant has cited to no harmful error in the Judge\u2019s findings or analysis. The \ndecision is sustainable on this record. \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted \nonly when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy \nv.

On November 1, 2022, after the hearing, Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Elizabeth M. Matchinski denied Applicant\u2019s \nrequest for a security clearance.

In \nessence, Applicant used marijuana and cocaine while in college from 2000 until 2004 and \ncontinued to use cocaine every few months for about a year after graduation. While in the Guard, \nhe used Percocet occasionally for back pain and purchased it illegally after his prescription ran \nout. In 2013 he started using heroin two to three times a week. In late 2013, Applicant underwent \ninpatient treatment for a diagnosis of opiate use disorder, followed by outpatient treatment. In \n2014 he was again prescribed Percocet, became addicted, and received a second round of inpatient \ntreatment in January 2015. Applicant entered a long-term rehabilitation program following \ntreatment but left prematurely against medical advice. He abstained from illegal drug use from \n2015 until 2019, when he resumed using marijuana for relaxation purposes, continuing until early \n2020. In late 2019, he was prescribed an opiate following surgery. When his prescription ran out, \nhe used heroin and a prescription opiate illegally until late 2019. He again relapsed into heroin \nuse for two months before beginning another course of therapy in November 2021.  \nApplicant used marijuana and heroin and misused Percocet after having been granted a \nsecurity clearance. The Judge found that Applicant made statements that were inconsistent with \none another or that were contradicted by other record evidence.1 He executed a statement of intent \nnot to use illegal drugs in the future and enjoys a good reputation for his work performance. \nCharacter references assert that he is intent on getting his problems behind him. \nThe Judge concluded that Applicant\u2019s use of cocaine following college was not recent. \nAccordingly, she resolved that allegation in his favor. However, she entered adverse findings for \nthe remaining allegations, noting that he had resumed heroin use as recently as late 2021, \nconcluding that Applicant\u2019s drug involvement other than cocaine did not happen so long ago that \nit no longer casts doubt upon his trustworthiness or good judgment. Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u204b \n26(a). She found that Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana and heroin while holding a clearance was an \naggravating factor and that he did not provide evidence of a favorable prognosis regarding his \nsubstance abuse diagnosis. \nDiscussion \nApplicant\u2019s appeal brief argues that the Judge failed to consider, or that she mis-weighed, \nsignificant record evidence, citing to Hearing Office cases on the question of recency. As we have \nnoted before, Hearing Office cases are not binding either on other Hearing Office Judges or on the \nAppeal Board.  Each case must be decided on its own merits.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 18-02074 \nat 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 27, 2019). In the case before us, given the extent of Applicant\u2019s drug \ninvolvement and his resumption of such conduct after treatment, we are unable to say that the \nJudge erred in concluding that Applicant\u2019s misconduct was recent. Applicant argues that the Judge \nerred by relying on the absence of a favorable prognosis. However, the challenged analysis by the \nJudge is directly relevant to the applicability of Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u204b 26(d), which assigns \n1 \u201cHe asserted in response to the SOR that he maintained complete abstinence from opioids and illegal drugs during \nand following his inpatient and outpatient treatment programs from late 2013 until the end of 2015 . . . However, as \nhe disclosed to an [OPM] investigator in September 2017, he became addicted to Percocet prescribed to him for pain \nin 2014.\u201d Decision at 3. \u201c[Applicant] testified that he left the long-term rehabilitation program prematurely because \nhe wasn\u2019t aware he was going to be there that long and \u2018his son\u2019s birthday was coming up.\u2019 . . . Based on the dates of \nhis stay in the program and his older son\u2019s birthdate, it appears that his son had his birthday the day before Applicant \nwas admitted to the program.\u201d Id. at 5. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                       \n \nmitigating effect to an applicant\u2019s completion of a drug treatment program accompanied by a \nfavorable prognosis by a \u201cduly qualified medical professional.\u201d Applicant\u2019s arguments are not \nsufficient to rebut the presumption that the Judge considered all of the evidence in the record, nor \ndo they demonstrate that the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, \nor contrary to law.

He has worked for his current employer since 2020 and has previously held security clearance eligibility. He is also self-employed. In 1998, he filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy, discharging about $10,000 of credit card debt. From 2008 to 2010, Applicant purchased three rental properties. By 2015, he could no longer pay the mortgages on all three. He walked away from two of the mortgages, defaulting on his payments. The debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c is one of the mortgages that was charged off for approximately $68,000. The debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b resulted from a default judgment on a credit card debt for about $9,000. The card was used to finance maintenance and expenses related to his rental properties. Finally, the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a resulted from a utility bill for about $11,000 owed to a landlord when Applicant operated a crypto-mining business in a residential apartment not intended for business purposes. Applicant rented the apartment because utilities were included. The landlord filed a lawsuit against Applicant that is still pending, and during the hearing, Applicant was vague as to the actions he took to address the debt and lawsuit. Applicant touted his substantial financial resources during the hearing and in evidentiary submissions. His annual salary is about $140,000, and he said that in 2022 he netted about $200,000.

He is also self-employed. In 1998, he filed \nChapter 7 bankruptcy, discharging about $10,000 of credit card debt. From 2008 to 2010, \nApplicant purchased three rental properties. By 2015, he could no longer pay the mortgages on all \nthree. He walked away from two of the mortgages, defaulting on his payments. The debt alleged \nin SOR \u00b6 1.c is one of the mortgages that was charged off for approximately $68,000. The debt \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b resulted from a default judgment on a credit card debt for about $9,000. The \ncard was used to finance maintenance and expenses related to his rental properties. Finally, the \ndebt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a resulted from a utility bill for about $11,000 owed to a landlord when \nApplicant operated a crypto-mining business in a residential apartment not intended for business \npurposes. Applicant rented the apartment because utilities were included. The landlord filed a \nlawsuit against Applicant that is still pending, and during the hearing, Applicant was vague as to \nthe actions he took to address the debt and lawsuit. \nApplicant touted his substantial financial resources during the hearing and in evidentiary \nsubmissions. His annual salary is about $140,000, and he said that in 2022 he netted about \n$200,000. Applicant\u2019s assets also included approximately $32,000 in cash and $325,000 in various \ninvestment accounts. After the hearing, Applicant provided documentation showing he negotiated \na payment plan with the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.b, made a $1,000 payment, and agreed to pay $235 \nper month from April 2023 to March 2026. He also provided a letter he sent to the District Court \nin April 2023 regarding the lawsuit on his utility debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a, acknowledging the \nlawsuit against him and promising to pay the debt. Finally, he provided a credit report that reflects \nthe charged-off mortgage alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c. \nThe Judge found that Applicant intentionally chose not to pay his mortgage on a rental \nproperty because it was no longer financially advantageous to him, and that he defaulted on a credit \ncard debt accrued to finance improvements and pay expenses for his properties because he no \nlonger owned the property and wanted to wash his hands of property-related debt, despite a default \njudgement entered against him. Additionally, his efforts to negotiate a settlement and begin paying \non the debt were not timely. Finally, Applicant\u2019s effort to contact the court where his landlord had \nfiled a lawsuit to collect the utility debt was not timely, and his promises to pay the debt in the \nfuture is inconsistent with financial responsibility. \nDiscussion \nOn appeal, Applicant contends the Judge was racially biased, bigoted, and displayed a \ndemeaning, hostile, and elitist attitude toward him. Additionally, he provided documents identical \nto those admitted into the record and argues that the Judge did not appropriately consider his \nfinancial status, financial history, record of financial accomplishments, assets on hand, and his \nclearance history. Finally, he alleges the Judge imposed a \u201cblack tax\u201d that places unreasonable \nrequirements and history of financial responsibility on African American applicants that are \ninconsistent with treatment given to non-minority clearance holders with similar financial \nbackgrounds. He notes, \nFinal [t]hought is there is no possible way a non[-]biased sane person would look \nat my financial status, and history and conclude that I do not pay bills or I\u2019m not \nwise with my money. There\u2019s no way a non-biased sane person would conclude \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nthat I couldn\u2019t be trusted with a clearance when I have proven the opposite for \ndecades now. App. Brief at 4. \nThere is a rebuttable presumption that a Judge is impartial and unbiased, and a party \nseeking to overcome that presumption has a heavy burden of persuasion. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n17-02391 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 7, 2018). Applicant\u2019s allegations of the Judge\u2019s racial bias or an \nelitist attitude, either during the hearing or in the decision, are baseless. We examined the entire \nrecord and Decision, paying particular attention to the transcript of the hearing. Our reading of the \nrecord reflects no such bias, either racially or otherwise, and the Judge\u2019s findings and conclusions \nare sound, based on the record, and fully considerate of the facts. We find nothing therein that \nwould cause a reasonable person to question the Judge\u2019s impartiality in this case. Applicant has \nneither rebutted the presumption that the Judge was unbiased nor established that he was denied \nany due process afforded him under the Directive. \nAdditionally, there is no evidence that the Judge imposed or adhered to a \u201cblack tax\u201d that \nwould have placed an unfair burden on, or disparate treatment of, Applicant as opposed to other \napplicants. A judge\u2019s expressed skepticism about the credibility of a witness does not cast doubt \non his or her impartiality. See, e.g., DISCR Case No. 90-0639 at 3, n.3 (App. Bd. Jul. 17, 1991). \nThe Adjudicative Guidelines do not compare behavior of one applicant against another as \u201ceach \ncase must be judged on its own merits.\u201d AG \u00b6 2(b). Nothing in the record supports Applicant\u2019s \nclaim that he has been singled out or treated unfairly. Claims that others with clearances have \nworse financial records is not a relevant consideration in this case. The conduct of others does not \nexcuse an applicant\u2019s security significant conduct or render it any less security significant. See, \ne.g., ISCR Case No. 90-0822 at 3-4, n.2 (App. Bd. Aug. 30, 1991). \nThe remainder of Applicant\u2019s appeal brief consists of an explanation of his efforts to \nresolve the alleged debts, financial history, and current financial status. Applicant\u2019s challenges to \nthe Judge\u2019s findings include to a large measure a disagreement with the manner in which the Judge \nweighed the evidence. To the extent that he is contending the Judge mis-weighed or did not \nconsider record evidence, we find no merit in those assertions. None of his arguments are enough \nto rebut the presumption that the Judge considered all of the record evidence or to demonstrate the \nJudge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. See, \ne.g., ISCR Case No. 21-01169 at 5 (App. Bd. May 13, 2022). \nApplicant\u2019s assertions on appeal substantially duplicate the information that was presented \nto the Judge. To the extent he is presenting new information, the Appeal Board is prohibited from \nconsidering new evidence on appeal. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29. It is also well established that an \napplicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts demonstrate a continuing course of conduct and can be viewed \nas recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-06532 \nat 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017). Moreover, the Board has held that until an applicant has a \nmeaningful financial track record, it cannot be said as a matter of law that he has initiated a good-\nfaith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolved debts. The phrase \u201cmeaningful track \nrecord\u201d necessarily includes evidence of actual debt reduction through payment on debts. See, e.g., \nISCR Case No. 05-01920 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 1, 2007). An applicant\u2019s promise to take remedial \naction in the future, however credible, is not evidence of actual rehabilitation. ISCR Case No. 95\u00ad\n0680 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 1996). There is no substitute for a track record of timely debt payments \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand otherwise acting in a financially responsible manner. See, e.g., ADP Case No. 07-13041 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Sep. 19, 2008). \nFinally, Applicant argues that he was previously awarded a security clearance when his \nfinances were worse than at present. The Government is not precluded from making an adverse \nclearance decision despite prior favorable ones, and a good security record is not a bar to an \nunfavorable decision. Applicant\u2019s prior favorable security adjudications were noted in the decision \nand the Judge was bound to consider them along with the other evidence in the record. However, \nApplicant has failed to rebut the presumption that the Judge considered all of the evidence in the \nrecord. See ISCR Case No. 11-14570 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 23, 2013). \nApplicant failed to establish that the Judge committed any harmful error or that he should \nbe granted any relief on appeal. The Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a \nsatisfactory explanation for the decision. The decision is sustainable on the record. \u201cThe general \nstandard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the \nnational security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nAlan V. Edmunds, Esq. \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nDecember 20, 2021, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for \nthat decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) and Guideline J \n(Criminal Conduct) of DoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive) and the \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) in Appendix A of Security Executive Agent \nDirective 4, effective June 8, 2017. Applicant requested a hearing. On March 21, 2023, after the \nrecord closed, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Robert E. \nCoacher denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. Applicant appealed pursuant to \nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in a finding of \nfact and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. \nConsistent with the following, we affirm. \nThe SOR contains six allegations\u2e3atwo under Guideline E and four under Guideline J. The \nJudge found in favor of Applicant on one Guideline E allegation and two Guideline J allegations.  \nThese favorable findings were not raised as an issue on appeal and are not discussed below. \nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis \nApplicant, who is in his late thirties, served on active duty in the military from 2005 to \n2013, in the reserve force from 2013 to 2018, and in the National Guard since mid-2022. He \nserved in combat operations and received a 90% disability rating from the Department of Veterans \nAffairs, primarily for his diagnosis of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.  \nThe Judge\u2019s three unfavorable SOR findings are related. These asserted that Applicant \nfalsified six reserve military orders by forging the signatures of military officials and submitted \nthose orders to his employers\u2e3aa county department and a state agency\u2e3ato receive paid military \nleave in 2015 and 2016 (a Guideline E allegation); that he was counseled in 2017 for providing \nfalse official statements under Article 107 (Uniform Code of Military Justice) (a Guideline J \nallegation); and that he was charged in 2018 with felony tampering with records, which was \ndismissed (a Guideline J allegation). In responding to the SOR, Applicant admitted these three \nSOR allegations with clarifying comments. \nIn falsifying the orders, Applicant listed his grade as an officer (O-2 or O-3) when he was \nan E-5 and forged or fraudulently supplied the name of the authorizing military official. Five of \nthe falsified orders were submitted to his state agency employer and the other to his county \ndepartment employer. He did not perform military duties on the days indicated in the falsified \norders and benefitted financially by receiving \u201cmiliary leave\u201d from the employers. He did not \ndisclose these offenses until he was caught during an employer\u2019s investigation. As a reason for \nengaging in such misconduct, Applicant claimed that his employers were not properly paying \nemployees for overtime they worked. When his military commander became aware of his \nfalsification of the orders, Applicant was issued a formal letter of counseling for making false \nofficial statements. Shortly thereafter, he quit the reserve force. \n[Applicant\u2019s] crimes of forging military orders in 2015-2016 were not \nminor events nor were they infrequent. They involved a calculated plan by \nApplicant to defraud his civilian employers of military leave benefits, which he did \nnot earn. Although Applicant acknowledged his behavior, he did not come forward \non his own, but only disclosed his crimes once he had been caught. He equivocated \non whether his [National Guard] unit is aware of his previous crimes forging \nmilitary orders. His reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment are still in \nquestion.

Decision at 3.  More specifically, Applicant argues: \n[Applicant] testified in his subject matter interview, and hearing, and wrote in his \nresponses that he extended some of the days that he would be drilling with these \nforgeries; he would drill but not for the full-time period he indicated. While the \nfirst drill order was false for three days, and the [Applicant] admitted that in his \nhearing, the Judge cannot overwrite direct evidence and testimony that [Applicant] \ndid, in fact, drill on some of the other five drill submissions.  [Appeal Brief at 9.] \nThis assignment of error does not merit any relief. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.30 provides that an \nappeal brief must cite specific portions of the case record supporting any alleged error. Applicant\u2019s \nbrief fails in this regard. It does not identify any specific evidence that supports this purported \nerror, which includes the footnotes in his brief that cite to pages of the hearing transcript. Of note, \nApplicant\u2019s testimony regarding the fraudulent orders does not support his claim of error. At the \nhearing, the following exchange occurred: \n[Department Counsel]: You were not actually performing drill[s] for the six orders \nthat you submitted? \n[Applicant]: I was performing drills. What it was, I extended the dates for the \ndrills. \n[Department Counsel]: Okay. Also for the dates that you extended it, you were \nnot performing drills on those dates? \n[Applicant]:  Correct.  [Tr. at 31.] \nDepartment Counsel then proceeded to question Applicant regarding three sets of the fraudulent \norders that were admitted into evidence as Government\u2019s Exhibit 6. For the first drill (November \n13-15, 2015), Applicant initially testified that he could not remember whether he drilled on those \ndays (Tr. at 43-44) but later acknowledged that he did not drill during that period. Tr. at 44, 52. \nFor the second drill (December 14-22, 2015), Applicant testified, \u201cI might have [drilled], I might \nnot. I don\u2019t recall,\u201d (Tr. at 45) and later stated \u201cit was probably . . . false.\u201d Tr. at 52. For the third \nset of orders (a five-month deployment starting in April 2016), Applicant admitted these orders \nwere fraudulent (Tr. at 46), did not testify that he performed military duties during this period, and \napparently left his civilian job at some point while purportedly deployed. Tr. at 46-51. In \nsummary, Applicant failed to establish that the Judge erred in making the challenged finding. \nAdditionally, even if the Judge erred in making that finding, it was a harmless error because it did \nnot likely affect the outcome of the case. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-01220 at 3 (App. Bd. Jun. \n1, 2020). \nApplicant also argues the Judge erred in failing to comply with the provisions in Executive \nOrder 10865 and the Directive by not considering all of the evidence, by not properly weighing \n3 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe evidence, and by not correctly applying the mitigating conditions and whole-person concept. \nIn his arguments, for example, he contends that the alleged misconduct is not recent or frequent, \nthat it occurred under unusual circumstances that are unlikely to recur, and that he has rehabilitated \nhimself in the intervening years. In rendering a decision, the Judge was required to consider all \nthe record evidence. Directive \u00b6 6.3. Given the nature and seriousness of Applicant\u2019s fraudulent \nconduct, we cannot conclude that the Judge erred in determining that the security concerns arising \nfrom such misconduct were not mitigated by the passage of time or by the other evidence of \nrehabilitation. None of Applicant\u2019s arguments are enough to rebut the presumption that the Judge \nconsidered all of the record evidence or to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner \nthat was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nAlan V. Edmunds, Esq. \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nDecember 17, 2021, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for \nthat decision\u2e3asecurity concerns raised under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption), Guideline J \n(Criminal Conduct), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive \n5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). Applicant requested a decision on the written \nrecord. On June 29, 2022, Department Counsel mailed a file of relevant material (FORM) to \nApplicant. Applicant provided no objections to the material provided and submitted no matters in \nextenuation or mitigation. On December 15, 2022, after consideration of the record, Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Pamela C. Benson denied \nApplicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 \nand E3.1.30. \nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge failed to properly \nconsider all available evidence and whether she misapplied the mitigating conditions, rendering \nher adverse decision arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. Consistent with the following, we \naffirm. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n       \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis \nApplicant is in his mid-fifties and twice-divorced, with three adult children. He served in \nthe military from 1985 through 1988. \nUnder Guideline G, the SOR alleged five arrests for driving under the influence, with the \nmost recent being December 2019, one alcohol-related disorderly conduct violation, excessive \nconsumption of alcohol from 1990 through 2019, and a 2021 diagnosis of Alcohol Use Disorder. \nThe alcohol offenses were cross-alleged under Guideline J, as well as an additional 1998 charge \nof obtaining a hunting license under false pretenses. The alcohol offenses and false pretenses \noffense were cross-alleged under Guideline E. Applicant admitted all allegations, and the Judge \nfound against him on all. \nIn his background clearance interview in July 2019, Applicant discussed his alcohol-related \noffenses, described his drinking pattern, and stated his intent not to drink to excess in the future. \nFive months later, in December 2019, Applicant was arrested for Extreme DUI with a blood \nalcohol content above .20%. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 2 days in jail, 22 days of \nwork release and 96 hours of home detention. Additionally, he attended DUI classes, completed \nalcohol screening, and paid a fine. Applicant stated his intent to abstain from alcohol completely \nafter his December 2019 arrest. In April 2021, he was diagnosed with Alcohol Use Disorder. In \nconcluding that Applicant did not mitigate the alcohol consumption, criminal conduct, and \npersonal conduct security concerns, the Judge found that: \nApplicant acknowledged his lapses in judgment due to his excessive use of \nalcohol and a long history of criminal and alcohol-related violations. This pattern \ndemonstrated that he was unable to learn from his mistakes and he places his \npersonal interests before his legal obligations and responsibilities. He also failed \nto provide supporting documentation concerning his alcohol counseling and \ntreatment following a 2021 diagnosis of alcohol use disorder. I cannot determine if \nhe has successfully completed treatment and if he has fully complied with the \ntreatment recommendations.  [Decision at 8.] \nDiscussion \nApplicant has not challenged any of the Judge\u2019s specific findings of fact. Through counsel, \nthe crux of Applicant\u2019s argument is that he has abstained from alcohol since his December 2019 \nDUI and that the Judge failed to give due weight to his abstinence and to the passage of time since \nhis last incident. We turn first to the issue of abstinence. Both in his November 2020 background \ninterview and in his response (undated) to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant noted that he stopped \ndrinking after the December 2019 DUI. GE 4 at 6 and 23. The Judge, however, determined that \nthere was \u201cinsufficient information in the record to demonstrate Applicant\u2019s claim that he has \nsuccessfully abstained from using alcohol since his most recent DUI arrent in December 2019.\u201d \nDecision at 5. That is, the Judge determined that Applicant\u2019s statements regarding abstinence were \nnot adequately corroborated in light of there being \u201cno information about his alcohol treatment \nfollowing his 2021 diagnosis of alcohol use disorder, details of his rehabilitation, or even a future \nfavorable prognosis.\u201d Id. An administrative judge is not required to accept an applicant\u2019s \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nrepresentation merely because it is unrebutted. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 99-0005 at 3 (App. Bd. \nApr. 19, 2000). The Judge was well within her authority to determine that Applicant\u2019s assertions \nof abstinence lacked corroboration and to decide the weight to be given to those assertions. \nWe turn next to Applicant\u2019s argument that the Judge did not consider the passage of time \nas a mitigating factor. The Board has repeatedly declined to furnish \"bright-line\" guidance \nregarding the concept of recency. The extent to which security concerns have become mitigated \nthrough the passage of time is a question that must be resolved based on the evidence as a whole. \nOur review of the record and decision establishes that the Judge carefully considered all evidence \nin mitigation, including the passage of time since the December 2019 conviction but determined \nit was insufficient\u2014for now\u2014given the long history of DUIs and the elevated BAC of the most \nrecent arrest. In light of the record before her, the Judge\u2019s determination that insufficient time has \npassed to conclude that Applicant is unlikely to engage in further misconduct was not arbitrary or \ncapricious. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 18-02586 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 9, 2019). \nApplicant\u2019s counsel also asserts that the Judge failed to consider Applicant\u2019s completion \nof a \u201ctreatment plan\u201d and \u201ctreatment programs.\u201d Appeal Brief at 6, 9, 10. However, Applicant\u2019s \nCounsel cites to no evidence in the record supporting these contentions, as required by Directive \nE3.1.30, and our review of the record reveals no evidence that Applicant was ever enrolled in, or \ncompleted, such a program. Instead, the record supports the Judge\u2019s finding that Applicant \nparticipated in a court-ordered DUI class, which was apparently online, and completed a court-\nordered alcohol screening.  GE 4 at 23; GE 5 at 2. \nNone of Applicant\u2019s arguments are enough to rebut the presumption that the Judge \nconsidered all of the record evidence or to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner \nthat was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. Moreover, the Judge complied with the \nrequirements of the Directive in her whole-person analysis by considering all evidence of record \nin reaching her decision. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-01400 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 3, 2020). \nApplicant has failed to establish that the Judge committed any harmful error or that he should be \ngranted any relief on appeal. The Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a \nsatisfactory explanation for the decision.  The decision is sustainable on the record.  \u201cThe general \nstandard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with national security.\u2019\u201d \nDepartment of the Navy v.

Mendez, Esq., Deputy Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nAlan V. Edmunds, Esq. \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nSeptember 23, 2021, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis of \nthat decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) of Security Executive Agent Directive 4 \n(effective June 8, 2017) and DoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). On \nOctober 12, 2023, after the record closed, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals Administrative \nJudge Eric H. Borgstrom denied Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility. Applicant appealed \npursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nThe SOR alleged nine delinquent debts totaling approximately $80,100. The Judge found \nfor Applicant on two debts and against him on the remaining seven, which total approximately \n$72,100. Applicant raises the following issues on appeal\u2014whether the Judge erred in his factual \nfindings, failed to properly consider all available evidence, and misapplied the mitigating \nconditions and Whole Person concept, rendering his adverse decision arbitrary, capricious, or \ncontrary to law.

Since 2015, Applicant has \nhad significant health issues requiring surgeries, hospitalizations, and periods in which he could \nnot work. He received full pay during these periods, however, and estimates his total out-of-pocket \nexpenses as under $10,000. At some point between late 2017 and late 2019, Applicant met with \nan Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator regarding his security clearance \napplication. The investigator made Applicant aware of several delinquent accounts, including six \nthat were ultimately alleged in the SOR. \nAll debts alleged on the SOR went into collections or were charged off in October or \nNovember 2017. For three of the alleged credit card debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.d), Applicant \nacknowledged that he was made aware of the debts during his OPM interview. He denies the debts \nand claims to have disputed them, but he did not submit documentary evidence of any efforts to \ndispute the accounts. He has not contacted any of these creditors, one of which is his primary bank. \nRegarding a fourth debt (SOR \u00b6 1.e), Applicant claimed in his June 2021 response to Government \ninterrogatories to have paid the debt, but he later claimed in his Answer and at hearing to be \nunfamiliar with the account. He has neither contacted this creditor nor disputed this debt. \nThe remaining three debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g, 1.h, and 1.i) are all with the same creditor and total \napproximately $45,100. At hearing, Applicant testified that he had originally disputed the three \naccounts but that he later admitted them and retained an attorney to negotiate settlements. Although \nhe testified that two of the three debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g and 1.h) were settled and paid in late 2021, he \nprovided no evidence of settlement agreements or payments. Applicant also testified that he was \ncurrently making monthly payments of $321 on SOR \u00b6 1.i and provided a copy of a check, but \nthere is insufficient account information to link the check to an alleged debt. Although Applicant \nprovided an undated letter from an attorney handling settlement negotiations for some of his debts, \nthe information provided in the letter does not confirm that the settled accounts are the same as the \nalleged debts. Moreover, the letter does not indicate when settlement agreements were reached and \nwhat, if any, payments have been made. \nApplicant testified that he had been informed about an OPM breach in 2015, but he has \nnever been notified of any identity theft involving his accounts and has never filed any identity \ntheft reports with law enforcement or credit bureaus. Together, Applicant and his partner earned \napproximately $315,000 annually. Applicant testified that he had the assets to resolve all of the \nalleged debts, but he did not believe them to be his. \nNo mitigating conditions fully apply. Although Applicant\u2019s medical issues were \ncircumstances beyond his control, he has failed to establish that he acted responsibly in the wake \nof these events to address and resolve his delinquent accounts, as he has taken no action on four \ndebts and failed to provide corroborating evidence as to his claimed settlement payments on the \nother three. Applicant does not have a reasonable plan to resolve the accounts. For the four debts \nthat he disputes (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, and 1.e), Applicant has not directly contacted the creditors, \nnot engaged his attorney to determine whether these debts are legitimate, and not provided proof \nto substantiate the basis for his dispute. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDiscussion \nThrough counsel, Applicant asserts that \u201cthe Administrative Judge improperly applied \nfactual findings that were unsupported in the record.\u201d Appeal Brief at 7. It is not entirely clear to \nwhat Applicant is referring, as he then cites largely to the Judge\u2019s analysis and application of \nmitigating conditions, rather than to findings of fact. We have previously noted that there is a \ndifference between errors in a judge\u2019s findings of fact and errors in the conclusions drawn \ntherefrom. See ISCR Case No. 22-00822 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 5, 2023); ISCR Case No. 23-00001 at \n4 (App. Bd. Sep. 28, 2023). Applicant\u2019s purported factual errors are simply challenges to the \nJudge\u2019s weighing of the evidence and are therefore addressed along with his other arguments. The \nonly reference to what would arguably be a finding of fact is the Judge\u2019s purported \u201caffirmative \nstatement that the Applicant has not hired a professional to assist him in settling and resolving the \ndebts.\u201d Id. at 8. However, counsel provides no cite to such a statement in the Judge\u2019s decision and \nour review reveals none. This assignment of error is without merit. \nMore broadly, Applicant contends the Judge erred in failing to comply with the provisions \nin Executive Order 10865 and the Directive by not considering all of the evidence in mitigation. \nFor example, Applicant argues that the Judge \u201cfailed to consider that [Applicant] was unwilling to \nsatisfy the debts because they were not accrued by him\u201d and that he did not \u201ceven consider the \nimpact of the OPM Data Breach in June 2015 other than to dismiss it.\u201d Id. Contrary to Applicant\u2019s \nargument, the Judge detailed Applicant\u2019s reference to the OPM data breach and his assertion that \nsome of the debts were not his. As the Judge concluded, however, Applicant failed to meet the \nfundamental requirements of AG \u00b6 20(e) in that he \u201cneither provided documented proof to \nsubstantiate the basis for his dispute nor provided evidence of actions he has taken to resolve the \nissue.\u201d Decision at 9. \nThe remainder of Applicant\u2019s brief is fundamentally an argument that the Judge \nmisweighed the evidence. None of Applicant\u2019s arguments, however, are enough to rebut the \npresumption that the Judge considered all of the record evidence or to demonstrate the Judge \nweighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. Moreover, the \nJudge complied with the requirements of the Directive in his whole-person analysis by considering \nall evidence of record in reaching his decision. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-01400 at 2 (App. Bd. \nJun. 3, 2020). \nApplicant has not established that the Judge committed harmful error. Our review of the \nrecord reflects that the Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory \nexplanation for the decision, which is sustainable on this record. \u201cThe general standard is that a \nclearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d \nDepartment of the Navy v.

In August 2007, he was arrested and charged with Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol or Drugs (DUI) and was subsequently convicted and sentenced to, among other things, one year of probation. Months later, in April 2008, he was charged with Minor in Possession of Alcohol, for which he was convicted, and his driver\u2019s license was suspended for 30 days. In August 2009, Applicant was arrested again for DUI and Refusal to Submit to a Preliminary Breath Test (Refusal); however, he failed to appear for hearing and a warrant was issued for his arrest in February 2010. He was subsequently convicted of the DUI charge in April 2013, sentenced to 12 months of probation, and ordered to complete an alcohol and drug treatment program, participate in Alcoholics Anonymous, install an interlock device in his car, and complete a DUI victim panel. Applicant began a six-month outpatient treatment program that same month, during which an evaluator recommended that he abstain from alcohol consumption. In November 2014, Applicant was charged once again with DUI, Refusal, and Failure to Maintain a Single Lane.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nPro Se \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nAugust 8, 2022, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that \ndecision\u2e3asecurity concerns raised under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) and Guideline G \n(Alcohol Consumption) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) \n(Directive). Applicant requested a decision on the written record. On November 21, 2022, the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) provided Applicant the Government\u2019s File of \nRelevant Material (FORM) and afforded him an opportunity to file objections or submit material \nin refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant did not submit a response to the FORM. On \nMarch 15, 2023, after considering the record, DOHA Administrative Judge Shari Dam denied \nApplicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 \nand E3.1.30. For the reasons stated below, we affirm. \nJudge\u2019s Findings and Analysis \nApplicant is 34 and has worked for a defense contractor since April 2020. In August 2007, \nhe was arrested and charged with Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol or Drugs (DUI) and was \nsubsequently convicted and sentenced to, among other things, one year of probation. Months later, \nin April 2008, he was charged with Minor in Possession of Alcohol, for which he was convicted, \nand his driver\u2019s license was suspended for 30 days. In August 2009, Applicant was arrested again \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfor DUI and Refusal to Submit to a Preliminary Breath Test (Refusal); however, he failed to appear \nfor hearing and a warrant was issued for his arrest in February 2010. He was subsequently \nconvicted of the DUI charge in April 2013, sentenced to 12 months of probation, and ordered to \ncomplete an alcohol and drug treatment program, participate in Alcoholics Anonymous, install an \ninterlock device in his car, and complete a DUI victim panel. Applicant began a six-month \noutpatient treatment program that same month, during which an evaluator recommended that he \nabstain from alcohol consumption. \nIn November 2014, Applicant was charged once again with DUI, Refusal, and Failure to \nMaintain a Single Lane. He again failed to appear for hearing and another warrant was issued for \nhis arrest in September 2015. He was served with the warrant in April 2018, at which time he was \nalso charged with Possession of Marijuana and Use/Possession with Intent to Use. Applicant pled \nguilty to DUI (2nd conviction) and Incapable of Safely Driving in June 2018 and was sentenced to \nfive days in jail and probation for either 12 months or until he completed the conditions of \nprobation, whichever occurred first. In January 2019, Applicant was charged with speeding and \nvarious driver\u2019s license infractions. He was also charged with violating the terms of his June 2018 \nprobation, for which he served two days in jail. In April 2019, Applicant was charged with \nTampering with an Ignition Interlock Device, which he denied, but was required to serve two days \nin jail for again violating the terms of his June 2018 probation. Applicant was released from \nprobation by court order in June 2019. \nThe SOR alleged concerns related to the foregoing charges and conduct, all which \nApplicant admitted with explanations. In determining that none of the mitigating conditions fully \napplied, the Judge found that between 2014 and 2019, Applicant had \u201cbeen involved in the legal \nsystem as a consequence of consuming too much alcohol on more than one occasion\u201d and that he \nhad \u201cnot acknowledged that he has an alcohol problem, and he continues to consume alcohol with \nregularity despite being advised during his treatment in 2013 to abstain.\u201d Decision at 6. The Judge \nconcluded that the circumstances underlying Applicant\u2019s legal problems \u201cwere not so unusual that \nthey are unlikely to recur,\u201d that there was insufficient evidence to \u201cverify that alcohol no longer \npresents a problem for him,\u201d and that \u201c[o]ther than his release from probation and the passage of \ntime from 2019 without recurrence of criminal activity, there is no other evidence of successful \nrehabilitation.\u201d Id. at 6, 7. \nDiscussion \nOn appeal, Applicant contends that \u201cthe Judge\u2019s unfavorable decision was reached in \nfactual error\u201d regarding his January 2019 driver\u2019s license infractions and speeding charge and his \nApril 2019 charge for Tampering with an Ignition Interlock Device (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.f). In support \nof his argument, he reiterates much of the same explanation he submitted in response to the SOR \n\u2013 that he had full driving privileges at the time he was pulled over for speeding and the license \ninfractions were subsequently dismissed (Appeal Brief at 2; FORM Item 2 at 1), and that he was \nno longer required to have a breathalyzer device installed in his vehicle and that charge was also \ndismissed. Appeal Brief at 1; FORM Item 2 at 2.1 \n1 Applicant also submits supplemental evidence in the form of additional details regarding the two incidents. The \nAppeal Board does not review cases de novo and is prohibited from considering new evidence on appeal.

The Judge\u2019s \nmaterial findings of security concern are \u201cbased upon substantial evidence or constitute reasonable \ninferences or conclusions that could be drawn from the evidence,\u201d and Applicant has cited to no \nharmful error in the Judge\u2019s findings. See ISCR Case No. 12-03420 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 25, 2014). \nRather, the record supports the Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant \u201chas a history of failing to \ncomply with the law, rules, and regulations, as demonstrated by his past alcohol-related criminal \nconduct\u201d and there \u201cis insufficient evidence to establish permanent behavioral changes in \nApplicant\u2019s consumption of alcohol and compliance with the law.\u201d Decision at 8. \nThe Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for \nher decision, and the record evidence is more than sufficient to support the Judge\u2019s findings and \nconclusions. The decision is sustainable on this record. \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance \nmay be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d \nDepartment of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel \nbeing considered for national security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6 2(b). \nOrder \nThe decision is AFFIRMED. \nSigned: James F.

He pled to contributing to the delinquency of a juvenile. He also \nreceived non-judicial punishment in 2014 while on active duty for wrongful appropriation of \nanother person\u2019s property.

Finally, the SOR alleged, under Guideline F, six delinquent \ndebts. \nThe Judge found against Applicant on the contributing to the delinquency of a juvenile \nconviction under Guidelines J and D. He found the remaining SOR allegations to be mitigated. In \nsummarizing the decision, the Judge found that although Applicant completed probation, his \nconduct was too recent and too serious to be considered fully mitigated under Guideline J. Further, \nhe engaged in a pattern of conduct in which he wrongfully asserted a parental or mentor-like \nresponsibility for vulnerable females. He did not show that his conduct occurred under such \nunusual circumstances or that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. Decision at 9. In addition, he found that the conduct was not \nmitigated under Guideline D for the same reasons as under Guideline J, and because it involved a \n12-year-old child who was unable to give meaningful consent, and the conduct was not private or \ndiscreet. Id. at 11. \nApplicant\u2019s appeal brief does not assert that the Judge committed any harmful error, nor \ndoes he dispute the Judge\u2019s findings or conclusions. Rather, it merely argues that he took \nresponsibility for his actions, completed probation, has not engaged in similar behavior since, and \nis a valued and respected employee. Appeal Brief at 1. Applicant\u2019s argument amounts to a \ndisagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, which is not sufficient to demonstrate \nthat he weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or \ncontrary to law. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007).

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nPro se \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nDecember 29, 2021, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for \nthat decision\u2015security concerns raised under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct), Guideline F \n(Financial Considerations), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of DoD Directive 5220.6 (January \n2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). Department Counsel requested a hearing. On December 16, \n2022, after close of the record, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative \nJudge Benjamin R. Dorsey denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. Applicant appealed \npursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nThe Judge found in favor of Applicant on the sole Guideline J allegation, one of two \nGuideline F allegations, and three of six Guideline E allegations. The unfavorable findings \ninvolved a state tax lien for about $900 entered against Applicant in 2011, and three \nfalsifications\u2e3adeliberately providing false information on a security clearance application (SCA) \nin 2020, during a background interview in 2020, and on a SCA in 2017. Regarding the state tax \nlien, the Judge noted that Applicant failed to provide documentary evidence corroborating his \nclaim that it was paid. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \nOn appeal, Applicant contends that he had a Secret clearance, and the current adjudication \nwas to determine whether he was eligible for a Top Secret clearance. He is apparently arguing \nthat his Secret clearance, having previously been adjudicated, should not have been revoked in this \nproceeding.  To the extent that he is arguing the Government is equitably estopped from revoking \nhis Secret clearance eligibility, we find no merit in that argument.  The Board has previously held \nthat there is no right to a security clearance, nor is there a presumption in favor of continuing or \ngranting a security clearance. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-08073 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Oct. 25, 2005). \nThe Government cannot be precluded from protecting classified information under the doctrine of \nequitable estoppel. Id. Moreover, the Government has the right to reconsider the security \nsignificance of past conduct in light of more recent conduct having negative security significance. \nId. Applicant\u2019s 2020 security clearance application (SCA) reflects that he was granted a security \nclearance in 1981 that was renewed in 2018. Government Exhibit (GE) 1 at 36-37. The \nGovernment was not precluded from reevaluating Applicant\u2019s past conduct in light of his ongoing \nfinancial delinquencies and new falsifications.  \nApplicant contends that he fully disclosed his criminal conduct when his security clearance \neligibility was continued in 2018. In his 2017 SCA, however, Applicant failed to disclose the \ncriminal charge against him for operating a vehicle while intoxicated in 2014. GE 2 at 29-30. \nBased on our review of the record, the Judge\u2019s material findings and conclusions regarding \nApplicant\u2019s alleged falsification of his 2017 SCA for failing to disclose that charge are based on \nsubstantial evidence or constitute reasonable inferences that could be drawn from the evidence. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-02225 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 25, 2019). \nApplicant further argues he has presented evidence to mitigate the Government\u2019s security \nconcerns. Some of his arguments extend to non-alleged conduct or to alleged conduct that the \nJudge found in his favor. None of his arguments are enough to rebut the presumption that the \nJudge considered all of the record evidence or to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence in \na manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 21-01169 at \n5 (App. Bd. May 13, 2022). Applicant also notes that he has lost his job due to the loss of his \nsecurity clearance. On this last point, the Directive does not permit us to consider the impact of an \nunfavorable decision. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-01206 at 2 (App. Bd. May 13, 2020).  \nApplicant failed to establish that the Judge committed any harmful error. The Judge \nexamined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision.

On October 19, 2022, after the hearing, Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Wilford H. Ross denied Applicant\u2019s request for a \nsecurity clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was \narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.

He served in the military, \nretiring in 2019 in the grade of O-4. Applicant holds a bachelor\u2019s degree as well as a master\u2019s and \nseeks to retain a security clearance in connection to his job. \nApplicant has had a series of sexual relationships outside of marriage, beginning around \n2016 and ending two years later. Although some of these were \u201cone night stands,\u201d one lasted for \nseveral months. Decision at 3. Applicant also has a \u201clong-term addiction to pornography, which \nhe is unable, or unwilling, to stop.\u201d Id. He has been receiving treatment for this condition since \nabout 2017 and participates in a 12-step program. \nIn 2021, a DoD psychiatric consultant, Dr. S, interviewed Applicant.  He also interviewed \nApplicant\u2019s supervisors, a security official, and a psychologist who at the time had been treating \nApplicant for several months. Dr. S diagnosed Applicant with a personality disorder, which \u201cwill \ninherently place [him] at a varying amount of risk in terms of judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness.\u201d Id. at 10. He stated that Applicant\u2019s \u201cemotional reactivity and perception of \nrejection\u201d could result in impulsive behaviors, noting that in the past Applicant had sought answers \nto his problems after he had acted in ways that contravened his values and caused harm to his \nfamily.  Id. \nApplicant has been seeing another provider, Dr. J, who stated by letter that Applicant \u201cis \ntaking his medications and comes to his follow-up appointments regularly.\u201d AE Q. In another \nletter, this provider stated that Applicant is motivated to seek help, complies with treatment, and \nis improving.  \nThe Judge made extensive findings of fact, quoting liberally from various evidentiary \ndocuments, such as Applicant\u2019s medical records. He summarized his material findings at the \nbeginning of the Analysis portion of the Decision, citing to Applicant\u2019s evidence that he has been \naddicted to pornography for many years, that he engaged in extra-marital sexual activity, and that \nhe engaged in inappropriate conduct at work, as a consequence of which two female workers \nblocked him on social media. Although he testified that he has not had an affair since 2018, \nApplicant advised that he continues to suffer from \u201cobsessive sexually-related thoughts and \noccasional obsessive conduct.\u201d Id. at 14. Applicant began treatment for his problems while still \non active duty, and he did not disclose his extra-marital affairs to providers for several months. \n\u201cApplicant has not always been an accurate reporter of his conduct . . . [F]or a considerable period \nof time he misstated or understated the extent of his conduct to his providers. His credibility, as \nwell as his judgment, are suspect.\u201d Id. \nIn evaluating Applicant\u2019s case for mitigation, the Judge noted that Dr. J\u2019s statements do \nnot qualify as a favorable prognosis. He concluded that there is no mental health finding that \nApplicant\u2019s problems are in remission or that there is a low probability of recurrence. He described \nApplicant\u2019s conduct as impulsive, high risk, and, insofar as acts of adultery occurred while he was \non active duty, illegal under the Uniform Code of Military Justice. Moreover, \u201cApplicant testified \nthat he continued to deal with [his problems] within a few months of the hearing.\u201d Id. at 16. The \nJudge concluded that Applicant had not met his burden of persuasion as to mitigation.  \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDiscussion \nApplicant contends that the Judge did not consider, or that he mis-weighed, significant \nrecord evidence, such as the length of time that has elapsed since his last act of extramarital sex, \nhis compliance with treatment, and the opinion of Dr. J. Applicant also contends that the Judge \ndid not demonstrate that his difficulties bore a meaningful relation to the question of his \nwillingness to protect classified information. In this regard, we note the opinion of Dr. S that \nApplicant suffers from a personality disorder that can manifest itself in impulsivity and poor \ndecision-making, which bears upon his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. That prognosis \nis not substantially refuted by Dr. J. Moreover, the Judge did not err in characterizing Applicant\u2019s \nextra-marital affairs and other sexual behavior as compulsive and of a nature to subject him to \nvulnerability to pressure or coercion. We find no reason to disturb the Judge\u2019s conclusion that the \nevidence raises security concerns under both Guidelines. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-02903 at 2 \n(App. Bd. Mar. 9, 2017) for the proposition that there is a nexus between admitted or proved \nconduct and an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a clearance. Considering the record as a whole, we \nconclude that Applicant has not rebutted the presumption that the Judge considered all of the \nevidence in the record or established that the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was \narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 18-02872 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. \n15, 2020). \nThe Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for \nthe decision. Applicant has cited to no harmful error in the Judge\u2019s findings or analysis. The \ndecision is sustainable on this record. \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted \nonly when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy \nv.

On \nDecember 13, 2021, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis of \nthat decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of DoD \nDirective 5220.6 (January 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). Applicant requested a hearing. On \nDecember 1, 2022, after the record closed, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nAdministrative Judge Benjamin R. Dorsey denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  \nApplicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nApplicant raises the following issue on appeal\u2014whether the Judge failed to properly \nconsider all available evidence, rendering his adverse decision arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to \nlaw.

A military veteran, she has \nan undergraduate degree and has worked for her current employer since 2019.  \nThe SOR alleged five delinquent debts totaling approximately $31,000. They include \ncredit card accounts, a car loan, and a business loan for which Applicant was personally \nresponsible. Additionally, the Government alleged that Applicant failed to file her federal income \ntax returns for Tax Years (TYs) 2016 and 2017 and her state returns for TYs 2010 \u2013 2012 and \n2016 \u2013 2018. In her Answer, Applicant partially denied the allegation concerning her state tax \nfilings, asserting that she was not required to file for 2010 \u2013 2012. She admitted all other \nallegations. \nApplicant attributed her financial problems to a failed business venture and a subsequent \nperiod of unemployment. In about 2014, Applicant started a small business that was initially \nprofitable, but became unprofitable by 2017. Applicant sold the business in 2018 and was then \nunderemployed for a few months, and unemployed for about five months. \nOf the five delinquent debts alleged, Applicant entered into payment agreements with two \ncreditors (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d) and started making monthly payments in March 2022. On two \ndelinquent credit card accounts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b), Applicant has not yet contacted the creditors. \nOn the fifth delinquent loan (SOR \u00b6 1.e), Applicant asserts that she has been unable to make a \npayment plan arrangement, despite her efforts.    \nRegarding her failure to file federal tax returns, Applicant stated that she forgot about her \n2016 return when it was due and that she has not yet filed. She plans to save money to pay the \ntaxes due, which she estimates at about $5,000, at the time she files. She filed her 2017 federal \nreturn in 2022 and paid $2,933.   \nRegarding her failure to file state tax returns, Applicant was not required to file for TYs \n2010 \u2013 2012. For TYs 2016 \u2013 2018, she failed to timely file. She stated that she did not file her \n2016 return because she forgot and did not file her 2017 and 2018 returns because she did not have \nthe funds to pay any taxes due. She has now filed her state tax returns for 2017 \u2013 2019, although \nlate, and timely filed her 2020 and 2021 returns.  She made payments in March 2022 and October \n2022 totaling about $1,300 for unspecified tax years. She plans to save money prior to filing her \n2016 state tax return so that she can pay taxes due at the time of filing. \nIn 2007, Applicant was granted a security clearance while on active duty with a warning \nthat her clearance would be suspended if she did not resolve her delinquent debts, which were \ncaused by her unemployment prior to military service.  \nNone of the mitigating conditions is fully applicable. While Applicant has provided \nevidence that she is resolving two of the SOR debts, she has not made sufficient headway on \nresolving the majority of those debts. She has not filed her 2016 federal or state income tax return \nand believes that she will have indebtedness when she does. Her financial issues are ongoing. \nAlthough some conditions were beyond her control, Applicant has not established that she acted \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nresponsibly under the circumstances. Moreover, her failure to file her federal and state returns was \nnot due to circumstances beyond her control.  \nDiscussion \nApplicant has not challenged any of the Judge\u2019s specific findings of fact. Rather, she \ncontends the Judge erred in failing to comply with the provisions in Executive Order 10865 and \nthe Directive by not considering all of the evidence, by mis-weighing the evidence, and by not \nproperly applying the mitigating conditions and whole-person concept. For example, Applicant \nargues that the Judge \u201cdid not place appropriate weight on the recency of [Applicant\u2019s] conduct[,]\u201d \nnoting that it has been five years since she last incurred any delinquent tax or consumer debt. \nAppeal Brief at 6. However, the Judge\u2019s determination that Applicant still has significant \nunaddressed delinquent debt and that she has not filed all her state and federal returns is supported \nby the record, as is his conclusion that \u201c[h]er financial issues are ongoing.\u201d  Decision at 6.  \nOur review of the record and decision confirms that the Judge considered and discussed \nthose issues highlighted by Applicant on appeal. None of Applicant\u2019s arguments are enough to \nrebut the presumption that the Judge considered all of the record evidence or to demonstrate the \nJudge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. See, \ne.g., ISCR Case No. 19-01400 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 3, 2020). Although we give due consideration \nto the Hearing Office cases that Applicant\u2019s counsel has cited, they are neither binding precedent \non the Appeal Board nor sufficient to undermine the Judge\u2019s decision. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n17-02488 at 4 (App. Bd. Aug. 30, 2018). \nApplicant failed to establish that the Judge committed any harmful error or that he should \nbe granted any relief on appeal. The Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a \nsatisfactory explanation for the decision.  The decision is sustainable on the record.  \u201cThe general \nstandard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with national security.\u2019\u201d \nDepartment of the Navy v.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nPro se \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nFebruary 11, 2022, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for \nthat decision\u2015security concerns raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement and Substance \nMisuse) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of DoD Directive 5220.6 (January 2, 1992, as \namended) (Directive). Applicant requested a hearing. On December 19, 2022, after the record \nclosed, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Robert Robinson \nGales denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. Applicant appealed pursuant to \nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nThe Judge found in favor of Applicant on one Guideline H allegation and the sole Guideline \nE allegation. Those favorable findings were not raised as an issue on appeal. The Judge found \nagainst Applicant on two Guideline H allegations. These alleged that Applicant used marijuana \nwith varying frequency from about May 2008 to at least January 2022 and that he intended to \ncontinue to use marijuana in the future.  \n\n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n               \n   \n \nIn his appeal brief, Applicant contends that the Judge\u2019s decision is unjust and inequitable.  \nHe argues that he has \u201cgone through extensive length to educate [himself] on the security clearance \nprocess and to ensure that [he is] in compliance with all aspects of the law and have sought out \nguidance from experts in the field to ensure [he is] fully aware of [his] obligations and \nresponsibilities as someone who holds a security clearance.\u201d Appeal Brief at 1. We construe his \narguments as contending that the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law and, \nmore specifically, that he is challenging the Judge\u2019s adverse determination regarding his intent to \nuse marijuana in the future. For reasons stated below, we affirm the Judge\u2019s decision. \nIntent to Use Marijuana in the Future Allegation \nThe Judge erred in his findings and conclusions regarding this allegation. In his security \nclearance application (SCA) of April 2021, Applicant disclosed his marijuana use from 2008 to \n2021 and stated, \u201cI do not intended (sic) to use it unless recommended by my doctor.\u201d Government \nExhibit (GE) 1 at 41-42.  In his background interviews of May 2021, Applicant reportedly stated: \n[Applicant] said that he realizes that it is possible that it is still considered a \nviolation of regulations to use MJ while holding a contract clearance position, and \nhe said that if his security officer says that it is still a violation of regulations, he \nwill have to consider what his future holds, . . . as to whether or not he plans to \ncontinue the MJ use, or whether or not he plans to continue in a contractor position \nwhich requires a clearance. [Applicant] said that at the time he filled out application \nand security forms for this current . . . contract position, he was unaware that \ncontinued MJ use violates regulations while holding a security clearance. \n[Applicant] knows that it is possible that he is still in violation of such protocols \nand regulations, as he still uses MJ today, with the current license, for medical \npurposes, but he is not sure if that is the case or not. [Applicant] said that he will \nfind out from his security officer.  [GE 2 at 12] \nIn his SOR Response, Applicant denied the allegation that he intended to continue to use marijuana \nand noted he has contacted a licensed substance abuse therapist and was scheduled to start a \nrecovery/substance abuse program. \nThe Judge found that Applicant \u201cclaimed that he does not intend to use marijuana in the \nfuture, [but] he might do so if it is recommended by his doctor. (Tr. at 29).\u201d In his analysis, the \nJudge stated: \n[Applicant] initially stated that he had no plans to stop using marijuana in the future, \nat least until someone at his place of employment tells him it is unacceptable to \ncontinue using it, but then changed his mind and stated he [has] no intent to use \nmarijuana in the future. He altered his comment again and stated that while he does \nnot intend to use marijuana in the future, he might do so if it is recommended by \nhis doctor. \nThus, his future intentions are not really convincingly clear. \n[Decision at 7.] \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nContrary to the Judge\u2019s finding quoted above, which cites to Tr. at 29, we are unable to \nfind that Applicant testified that he still intended to use marijuana if his doctor recommended that \nhe do so. During the hearing, the following exchange occurred: \n[Department Counsel]: The next allegation is your previous, at least stated, intent \nthat you intended to continue using marijuana. I would draw your attention to your \n[SCA] where you stated that you did not intend to use it unless recommended by \nyour doctor and your discussion in the interview that your doctor recommended it.  \nSeems like in your answer you clarify that you actually have no intention of future \nuse now that you\u2019re understood what the federal prohibition is, is that correct? \n[Applicant]:  That is correct. \n[Department Counsel]: So, it was a combination of this process and it sounds like \nsome research that you did that brought you to the understanding that although it is \nlegal for medical use in [his state], it is not legal federally and, therefore, you do \nnot intend to continue using with a clearance, if you are granted.  \n[Applicant]:  That is correct.  [Tr. at 28-29. See also, Tr. at 30, 34, and 36.] \nWe conclude the Judge erred by interpreting Applicant\u2019s testimony as indicating he might use \nmarijuana in the future if a doctor recommended it. This error, however, was harmless for the \nreasons stated below. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-01220 at 3 (App. Bd. Jun. 1, 2020) (an error is \nharmless if it did not likely affect the outcome of the case). \nUse of Marijuana Allegation \nIn responding to the SOR, Applicant admitted that he used marijuana from May 2008 to at \nleast January 2022. Applicant stated in his SCA that he \u201c[t]ried marijuana a handful of time (sic) \nsince 2008[.]\u201d GE 1 at 41. Later, during his background interview, he reportedly stated he \n\u201chabitually used MJ, once per week, unknown number of times (in the several hundreds), in [his \nstate], for what he claims is continuous, current, and extensive use of MJ for nutritional and \nmedicinal purposes (even though subject was illegally using MJ from 2008 to recent months, when \nhe recently obtained a [state] medical license for such usage).\u201d GE 2 at 9. The Judge concluded \nthat Applicant \u201cgave inconsistent evolving accounts of his use of marijuana[.]\u201d Decision at 7. The \nJudge also concluded that Applicant\u2019s unalleged purchases of marijuana could be considered for \nlimited purposes, including in evaluating the mitigating evidence. \nApplicant continued to use marijuana after submitting his SCA in April 2021 and \nundergoing background interviews in May 2021. During his interviews, Applicant was questioned \nextensively about his marijuana use, including being contacted two days after the initial interview \nto further discuss that particular issue. GE 2 at 9-12. As noted above, he acknowledged during \nthe interviews that it is possible he is in violation of \u201cprotocols and regulations\u201d due to his \nmarijuana use and that he would check with his security officer about that issue. Id. at 12. It is \nreasonable to conclude the SCA and interviews adequately placed Applicant on notice that his \nmarijuana use raised security concerns, yet he continued to use that substance after submitting his \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSCA and undergoing those interviews. As the Appeal Board has previously stated, after applying \nfor a security clearance and being adequately placed on notice that such conduct was inconsistent \nwith holding a security clearance, an applicant who continues to use marijuana demonstrates a \ndisregard for security clearance eligibility standards, and such behavior raises substantial questions \nabout the applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 20-02974 at 6 (App. Bd. Feb. 1, 2022). \nIn his analysis, the Judge stated: \nA person should not be held forever accountable for misconduct from the \npast. Continued abstinence is to be encouraged, but, when balanced against \n[Applicant\u2019s] full history of marijuana use, the relatively brief period of reported \nabstinence is considered insufficient to conclude that abstinence will continue, \nespecially after so many altered plans regarding the use of marijuana. Applicant\u2019s \nuse of marijuana for such a lengthy period, despite that fact that such use was \nprohibited by both the Federal Government and government contractors, continues \nto cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.             \n[Decision at 8.]  \nBased on our review of the record, the Judge\u2019s conclusions regarding Applicant\u2019s marijuana use \nfrom 2008 to 2022 are sustainable and sufficient to support denial of his security clearance \neligibility regardless of the errors discussed above. \nApplicant failed to establish the Judge committed any harmful error. The Judge examined \nthe relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision.

For reason stated below, we remand the Judge\u2019s decision for corrective \naction.  \nApplicant\u2019s student loan debt resulted from her attendance at two institutions. Tr. at 24-39. \nShe began attending College A in 2009 but stopped after her first semester for personal reasons. \nTr. at 25. Several years later, she began attending College B, but was again unable to complete her \ndegree. Tr. at 25-26. In or around January 2020, she applied for a program to wipe away her student \nloan debt resulting from her attendance at College B (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.d-1.f, 1.h, 1.i). Tr. at 34, 38; \nGovernment Exhibit 5. Applicant testified that she did not apply for discharge of the loans \nassociated with her attendance at College A (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.g.) and that she planned to enter a \nrepayment plan for those accounts. Tr. at 32-34. \nPost-hearing, Applicant offered into evidence two documents that were cumulatively \nmarked as Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A. The first document is an excerpt from a DoE Loan Rehabilitation \napplication dated October 11, 2022. Applicant Exhibit A at 1-2. The second document includes an \nAugust 18, 2022, notice from DoE informing Applicant that her class action lawsuit related to her \nstudent loan discharge application was pending a proposed settlement. Applicant Exhibit A at \n3-10. \nThe Judge found that Applicant submitted a loan rehabilitation request, noted she attended \none of the schools more than a decade ago, and described her action as \u201ctoo little, too late.\u201d \nDecision at 2. The Judge appears to have inadvertently overlooked the second document included \nin Exhibit A regarding Applicant\u2019s inclusion in the class action lawsuit pending settlement, and \ntherefore failed to consider the impact of that action, if any, on some portion of Applicant\u2019s student \nloan debts. \nOn November 16, 2022, a Federal court approved a settlement in the class action lawsuit, \nwhich affects the processing of borrower defense applications filed on or before November 15, \n2022, and identifies borrowers whose applications for borrower defense discharges were pending \nas of June 22, 2022, as \u201cClass Members.\u201d See https://studentaid.gov/announcements-events/sweet\u00ad\nsettlement. Appeal Exhibit 1. For members of that class action lawsuit, the DOE press release \nindicates that Federal student loans associated with the member\u2019s attendance at the listed schools \nwill be discharged, DoE will refund amounts paid on those loans, and credit tradelines for those \nloans will be deleted from the member\u2019s credit report. In ISCR Case No. 21-01688 (App. Bd. Jan. \n30, 2023), the Appeal Board took administrative notice of a DoE press release addressing the \ndischarge of student loans and remanded the Judge\u2019s decision so that he could consider the impact \nof DoE\u2019s action on the alleged debts. See also ISCR Case No. 20-03688 (App. Bd. Mar. 2, 2023), \na remand involving this same type of issue.  We take that same action here. \nBased on the foregoing, the Judge\u2019s decision is remanded so that he may determine the \nimpact of DOE\u2019s action on Applicant\u2019s student loans, which make up most of the alleged debt. \nThe Judge may reopen the record to receive additional evidence from the parties. On remand, the \nJudge is required to issue a new decision. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.35. The Board retains no continuing \njurisdiction over a remanded decision. However, a Judge\u2019s decision issued after remand may be \nappealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28. and E3.1.30. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOrder \nThe decision is REMANDED. \nSigned: James F.

Applicant neither submitted \nany documents to corroborate the explanation in his SOR Response nor submitted a response to \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s File of Relevant Material (FORM).  The Judge found against Applicant on \neach of the SOR allegations. \nThe Judge found that Applicant received probation and a fine for his 2014 possession of \nmarijuana charge. The disposition of Applicant\u2019s 2019 possession of marijuana charge is \nunknown. FORM Item 4 at 5. In his appeal brief, Applicant states that, on October 6, 2022, the \nPresident of the United States pardoned all U.S. citizens for the offense of simple possession of \nmarijuana in violation of the U.S. Code and D.C. Code. To the extent he is contending this pardon \napplies to him, we find that argument unpersuasive. There is no basis for concluding the \nPresident\u2019s pardon has any impact on Applicant\u2019s state drug possession charges. We find \nadversely to Applicant on this assignment of error. \nIn his appeal brief, Applicant raises an issue regarding the dates of his alleged drug \ninvolvement. Those dates are based on statements he reportedly made during his background \ninterviews. FORM Item 4. When he responded to interrogatories, Applicant adopted the \nsummaries of the background interviews as accurate and did not make any corrections to the dates \nof his drug involvement.1 In addressing the drug involvement allegations in his SOR response, \nApplicant stated, \u201cThe timespan noted was persuaded by the investigator during the interview as \na general from and to date.\u201d FORM Item 1 at 6. In his brief, Applicant again raises the issue by \nstating, \u201csome of the dates noted for use were persuaded/influenced by the investigators.\u201d Appeal \nBrief at 1. However, neither Applicant\u2019s SOR response nor his appeal brief identifies any specific \ndates that are incorrect or provides any evidence to corroborate his claim. An appealing party must \nstate with sufficient specificity what it is about a Judge\u2019s decision that he or she believes to be \nerroneous so that reviewing authorities, such as the Appeal Board, are enabled to address the \nassignment of error. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-03372 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Oct. 19, 2018). \nApplicant\u2019s assertions regarding this issue fail for a lack of specificity and fail to establish the \nJudge committed any harmful error. \nApplicant also challenges the Judge\u2019s adverse falsification determination. In his 2017 and \n2021 SCAs, Applicant disclosed that he was charged with a \u201cpossession\u201d offense in 2014 (FORM \nItems 2 at 26-27 and 3 at 27) but responded \u201cno\u201d to all the Section 23 \u2013 Illegal Use of Drug or \nDrug Activity questions. In a background interview on February 2, 2018, Applicant reportedly \ndenied any purchase of illegal drugs in the past seven years but no mention is made of marijuana \nuse. FORM Item 4 at 13. During a background interview on March 29, 2018, Applicant reportedly \nstated he \u201csmoked marijuana joints once per year for 2 years[,]\u201d but the specific years of such use \nwere not identified. FORM Item 4 at 14. During a background interview on July 28, 2021, \nApplicant reportedly stated he smoked marijuana twice between 2012 and 2014, \u201cwhich was \nindicated in his previous interview[,]\u201d and he \u201cused marijuana occasionally, possibly one a year \nover a couple of years on vacation as a recreational use\u201d from 2014 to 2019. FORM Item 4 at 6. \n1 In his interrogatory response, Applicant added the following comment: \u201cTo address items noted as discrepant under \nthe employment and residence section; the estimated months and dates noted are fairly accurate.\u201d The Judge \napparently interpreted the latter phase as pertaining to Applicant\u2019s drug involvement. We do not agree with that \ninterpretation but instead construe that phase as referring to the employment and residence sections of the background \ninterview. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhen asked during that latter interview why he did not report his marijuana usage or the 2019 \narrest for possession of marijuana on his SCA, Applicant reportedly stated, \u201cit wasn\u2019t that serious, \nand the case wasn\u2019t yet resolved to his knowledge.\u201d FORM Item 4 at 6. As the Appeal Board has \nsaid previously, multiple omissions undercut any argument that an applicant\u2019s failure to disclose \nrequired information was the result of mistake, oversight, or lack of recall. See, e.g., ISCR Case \nNo. 19-02345 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2021). Noting that Applicant was a mature, educated adult \nwith experience in the adjudication process, the Judge concluded that he intentionally falsified his \nSCAs.  In his appeal brief, Applicant claims: \nI noted on the [SCA] that I would\\have discussed any items with the investigator, \nwhen meeting with the investigator I explained I was unaware of the process and \nquickly resubmitted my [SCA] without further review. I was under the impression \nI received an [SCA] request that it was time to renew my secret clearance so I just \nresubmitted w/o updates related to the dismissed 2022 (sic) possession case. In the \n[quote] below the investigator notes that I mentioned the 2022 (sic) incident w/o \nbeing questioned. I was unaware that pending or dismissed cases needed to be \nadded to the [SCA], I was never informed until talking with the investigator that \nday. [Appeal Brief at 2.] \nWe do not find Applicant\u2019s argument persuasive and note that he certified in his 2017 and 2021 \nSCAs that his statements in those documents were true, complete, and correct to the best of his \nknowledge and belief and were made in good faith. FORM Items 2 at 1 and 3 at 34. An applicant\u2019s \nknowing omission of required information from an SCA, even if he or she had the intent to later \ndisclose that information during a background interview, is a deliberate falsification. From our \nreview of the record, the Judge\u2019s material findings and conclusions of a security concern regarding \nApplicant\u2019s falsification allegation are based on substantial evidence or constitute reasonable \ninferences that could be drawn from the evidence. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-02225 at 2-3 (App. \nBd. Jun. 25, 2019). \nApplicant failed to establish the Judge committed any harmful error. The Judge examined \nthe relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision. The decision is \nsustainable on the record. \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \n\u2018clearly consistent with national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v.

See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 14-00812 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 8, 2015). Applicant\u2019s appeal brief raises such a due \nprocess issue, as he asserts that he submitted materials in response to the FORM that were not \nforwarded to or considered by the Judge. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                     \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \nThe SOR alleged 17 delinquent debts that totaled about $48,000. In his Answer to the \nSOR, Applicant admitted the debts and submitted documentation of his ongoing efforts to \nresolve the debts. On May 13, 2022, Department Counsel sent Applicant a copy of the File of \nRelevant Material (FORM). On May 23, 2022, Applicant signed a document acknowledging \nreceipt of the FORM. That correspondence afforded him 30 days from its receipt\u2014until June \n22, 2022\u2014to submit additional matters to DOHA. \nFrom the record and appeal brief before us, it appears that Applicant responded to the \nFORM on May 24, 2022, but that he mailed his cover letter and supporting documents to DoD\u2019s \nadjudication office at Fort Meade rather than to DOHA. Applicant followed up this initial hard-\ncopy response with email correspondence to Department Counsel on June 6, 2022, and again on \nJune 22, 2022. That email correspondence, however, did not contain any supporting documents \nfrom the initial hard-copy response. In other words, the FORM was submitted to the Judge with \nthe email correspondence sent to Department Counsel, but lacking the documents sent to Fort \nMeade. The Judge issued his decision on December 19, 2022.1 In his appeal, Applicant requests \nthat his FORM response be taken into consideration. \nGiven these circumstances, we conclude the best solution is to remand the case to the \nJudge so that he may reopen the record to correct this error. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.35 requires the \nJudge to issue a new decision on remand. The Board retains no continuing jurisdiction over a \nremanded decision. However, a decision issued after remand may be appealed pursuant to \nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 to E3.1.35. \n1 Although the Judge states in his decision that Applicant did not respond to the FORM, he later cites to items that \nApplicant submitted by email correspondence to Department Counsel. From our review, it appears that the Judge \nreceived and considered the matters that Applicant submitted by email to Department Counsel. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nOrder \nThe Decision is REMANDED. \nSigned: James F.

Applicant\u2019s annual income is approximately $100,000, and his monthly net \nremainder after expenses is approximately $3,600. \nThe Judge noted that Applicant provided inconsistent statements regarding the status of his \nstudent loans over the course of his clearance investigation and hearing.

In his October 2021 response to interrogatories, Applicant asserted that his \nstudent loans were deferred under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act. \nDecision at 2-3; GE 3 at 7. At the March 8, 2023, hearing, Applicant first testified that his loans \nwere placed into forbearance in about 2016 and, while he understood he would have to reapply for \nforbearance when the initial term expired in about two years, he \u201cassumed the loans were still in \nforbearance because he had never received any notification from the student loan creditor that the \nforbearance term had ended.\u201d Decision at 3; Tr. at 18-19, 25-27. He realized he needed to pay his \nstudent loans at some point but had not prioritized it. Decision at 3.

As \nof the hearing, Applicant had not contacted the creditor to request another loan forbearance. \nDecision at 4. \nApplicant testified and his post-hearing documentation supports that he contacted the \nDepartment of Education (ED) on February 23, 2023, about two weeks before the hearing, and \napplied for a program to assist him in getting his student loans out of default. Id. On March 3, \n2023, ED confirmed receipt of the application and notified Applicant that his loans would be \ntransferred to another loan creditor in about 15 days; however, as of the close of the record, \n\u201cApplicant had not yet been contacted by the new loan creditor or notified of the specific amount \nof his monthly loan payments.\u201d Id. \nThe Judge found that over the course of his security clearance investigation, which began \nwhen he completed his application in January 2020, Applicant \u201chad plenty of opportunities to take \nresponsible action to begin repaying his delinquent loans;\u201d however, he did not initiate contact \nwith ED until after the Judge contacted him in February 2023 to schedule his hearing. Id. at 7. The \nJudge found that Applicant\u2019s financial problems did not result from conditions beyond his control \nand that he \u201cdid not act responsibly because he failed to dutifully address his delinquent student \nloans earlier.\u201d Id. In finding against Applicant on all three SOR allegations, the Judge concluded \nthat Applicant\u2019s \u201cconduct demonstrates a lack of fiscal responsibility and raises unmitigated \nquestions about his reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information.\u201d Id. at \n8. \nOn appeal, Applicant makes no assertion of error on the part of the Judge. Rather, he \nsubmits new evidence in the form of a narrative update on the status of his student loans. The \nAppeal Board does not review cases de novo and is prohibited from considering new evidence on \nappeal. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29. The Board\u2019s authority to review a case is limited to matters in which \nthe appealing party has alleged that the Judge committed harmful error. Applicant has not alleged \nany such harmful error and therefore the Judge\u2019s decision denying Applicant a security clearance \nis sustainable. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOrder \nThe decision is AFFIRMED. \nSigned: Jennifer I.

On \nFebruary 11, 2022, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for \nthat decision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) of Security Executive Agent Directive 4 \n(effective June 8, 2017) and DoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). \nApplicant requested a hearing. On April 14, 2023, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \nAdministrative Judge Pamela C. Benson denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. \nApplicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nThe SOR alleged two consumer debts charged off for approximately $53,000. The Judge \nfound against Applicant on both allegations. On appeal, Applicant asserts that the Judge failed to \nproperly consider all available evidence, rendering her adverse decision arbitrary, capricious, or \ncontrary to law, and failed to properly apply the mitigating conditions and whole-person analysis. \nConsistent with the following, we affirm. \nJudge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis \nApplicant, in her mid-50s, has been married for over 40 years and has four adult children. \nShe has been employed by a federal contractor since 2010 and her annual salary is approximately \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n$51,600. Applicant\u2019s husband, who was previously employed as an aircraft electrician, started his \nown day trading business in about 2006. He has been unemployed since late 2017 when he became \na full-time caregiver for his disabled mother. \nApplicant denied liability for both delinquent credit cards alleged in the SOR. Although \nthe debts were opened jointly with her husband in 1986, she explained that she did not authorize \nthe charges. Rather, Applicant asserted that her husband began to finance his business with the \ncards in about 2016 and she only became aware of the debts in 2017. Applicant disputed the debts \nwith the credit reporting agencies, citing her state\u2019s statute of limitations as additional reason to \nremove the accounts from her reports. She has made no payments on the delinquent accounts and \ndid not intend to contact the creditors because she is nearing the end of the seven-year credit \nreporting period and did not want to restart that timeframe. Applicant admitted that there were \nabout six other credit cards with similar delinquent balances that have dropped off her credit report \nwithout being paid. As of her August 2021 personal financial statement, Applicant had over \n$210,000 in savings, made monthly contributions of over $400 to her retirement account, and had \na net monthly remainder of over $700 after all other expenses were paid. \nThe Judge found that Applicant \u201chas not made an effort to responsibly repay the \noutstanding joint accounts she is legally responsible for despite the ample financial resources in \nher savings account that could easily pay the debts in full.\u201d Decision at 8. While her husband\u2019s use \nof the funds to pay for his failing business amounts to a condition beyond Applicant\u2019s control, she \nfailed to reasonably explain why she was unable to make more progress resolving the accounts in \nlight of said financial resources. The Judge concluded that Applicant\u2019s \u201cactions demonstrate a lack \nof fiscal responsibility and good judgment, and raise unmitigated questions about her reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information.\u201d Decision at 9. \nDiscussion \nApplicant has not challenged any of the Judge\u2019s specific findings of fact. On appeal, she \nargues that the Judge erred in failing to comply with the provisions in Executive Order 10865 and \nthe Directive by not considering all the evidence and by not properly applying the mitigating \nconditions and Whole-Person Concept. For example, Applicant argues that the Judge failed to \nconsider Applicant\u2019s husband\u2019s explanation for the origin of the delinquencies and that Applicant \ndisputed the accounts with the credit reporting agencies. Appeal Brief at 5-6. These arguments are \nmeritless. The Judge\u2019s decision acknowledged that \u201cApplicant\u2019s husband\u2019s attempt to refinance \nlosses from his failed business is a condition beyond her control and contributed to her financial \nproblems,\u201d but still concluded that \u201cboth parties are legally responsible for debt repayment on joint \naccounts, even if only one incurred the debt,\u201d and that Applicant made no effort to repay the \naccounts despite having the financial means to do so. Decision at 8. Indeed, despite Applicant\u2019s \nrepeated assertion that she did not incur the debts directly, her lack of awareness about her \nsignificant financial problems, even when caused by her spouse, raise serious questions about her \nattention to detail regarding important matters and thereby also about her security clearance \nworthiness. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 13-00786 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 28, 2014). The Judge also \nnoted Applicant\u2019s attempted reliance on credit report disputes to address the delinquent accounts, \nbut correctly concluded that, even if she had been successful in removing the accounts, such \nremoval is not meaningful evidence of debt reduction. Decision at 8. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant also argues that the Judge \u201cdid not place appropriate weight on the recency of \n[Applicant\u2019s] conduct,\u201d because \u201cthe debts arose around 2017 when unbeknownst to her that her \nhusband\u2019s day trading failed.\u201d Appeal Brief at 6. The record reflects that the two credit cards, \nwhich Applicant acknowledged were opened jointly with her husband in 1986, became delinquent \nin August 2016 and were charged off at the beginning of 2017. Government Exhibit (GE) 2 at 8; \nApplicant Exhibit (AE) D at 8, 12. She learned that the accounts were delinquent in mid-2017 and \nsubsequently received notices from collection agencies. Tr. at 34; GE 2 at 8. In her August 2021 \nresponse to Government interrogatories, Applicant provided documentation reflecting that she had \n\u2013 that same day \u2013 sent letters to the credit reporting agencies to dispute eleven debts, including the \ntwo alleged in the SOR, on the basis that each was an \u201cunverified account.\u201d GE 3 at 11-19. She \nnever contacted the creditors directly and made no payments on the delinquent balances. Tr. at 34, \n41, 45. As of February 2023, the accounts continued to report as charged off and unresolved. AE \nD at 8, 12. The record supports that the debts remain outstanding and unaddressed, and therefore \nrepresent a continuing course of conduct, which undermines any argument that her debts are not \nrecent or are unlikely to recur. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 09-01309 at 4 (App. Bd. Apr. 29, 2010). \nApplicant\u2019s arguments on appeal simply advocate for an alternative weighing of the evidence, \nwhich is not enough to show that the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a \nmanner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007). \nApplicant has not established that the Judge\u2019s conclusions were arbitrary, capricious, or \ncontrary to law. In the instant case, the Judge examined the relevant evidence, weighed the \ndisqualifying and mitigating evidence, and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision. \nThe record is sufficient to support that the Judge\u2019s findings and conclusions are sustainable. \u201cThe \ngeneral standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests \nof the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v.

The Judge found in favor of Applicant on three of the allegations, but against \nhim on SOR \u00b6 1.a, an account charged off for about $48,000.

When questioned \nabout his delay in resolving the debt, Applicant testified that he was working under the assumption \nthat his ex-wife was making the payments, even though he was the responsible party, because they \nhad spoken about it and because he was paying her alimony and child support.

For example, Applicant \nargues that the Judge \u201cdid not place appropriate weight on . . . the good faith efforts made and [the] \narticulated plan to pay off underlying delinquencies.\u201d Appeal Brief at 5. However, the Judge\u2019s \ndetermination that it was \u201cclear [Applicant] was aware of [SOR \u00b6 1.a], but only began to address \nit . . . after the issuance of the SOR\u201d is supported by the record, as is his conclusion that Applicant\u2019s \nresponse to the debt was insufficient to mitigate the financial concern. Decision at 2. Applicant\u2019s \narguments on appeal advocate for an alternative weighing of the evidence, which is not enough to \nshow that the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, \ncapricious, or contrary to law. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd.

Serving in either an \nactive duty or reserve military status from 1978 to 1983 and 1990 to 1996, he has held a security \nclearance since 2016. \nIn early 2020, Applicant\u2019s employer sent him for a fitness for duty examination because he \nreported break-ins to his residence and truck that were unsubstantiated. A doctor of osteopathic \nmedicine (Dr. K) conducted the fitness for duty examination, opined that Applicant suffered from \nminor post-traumatic stress disorder and mild paranoid/compulsive thought process without \npsychiatric illness, and concluded he was fit for duty. \nApplicant claimed employees of a local security company broke into his truck and were \nharassing, bullying, tormenting, threatening, and terrorizing him daily. He also accused the \ncompany of sending someone to scare his elderly mother who lived in another state. He believed \nneighbors who lived above him worked for the company and were conducting surveillance on him \nand breaking into his apartment and truck. Police officers questioned the neighbors but found \nnothing to support Applicant\u2019s claims. Applicant provided no proof supporting his beliefs. At the \nhearing, he testified that his truck was broken into every day for two years because he had noticed \nsmall differences in the positioning of a handicap placard or the truck\u2019s mirrors and visor. \nPursuant to a DoD request, Dr. S, a licensed psychologist, evaluated Applicant in late 2021. \nDuring the evaluation, Applicant related the details of his concerns, including that he was being \ninvestigated and harassed by the IRS or its agents. Dr. S diagnosed Applicant with Delusional \nDisorder, Persecutory Type, which impaired his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. Dr. S \nrecommended he undergo a thorough personality assessment or neuropsychological evaluation to \ndetermine the specific mental health condition likely contributing to his paranoid thinking and \nfixed belief structure. At the hearing, Applicant denied that he told Dr. S certain items in the \nreport, claimed the interview only lasted about 15 minutes, but also acknowledged he did not file \na complaint against Dr. S for lying on her report. \nIn late 2022, Applicant\u2019s Counsel referred Applicant for a psychological assessment with \nDr. T who has a Ph.D. in counseling and is a licensed marriage and family therapist. Dr. T opined \nthat Applicant did not appear to present with psychological symptoms that would impair judgment. \nShe noted that Applicant denied a history of delusional or psychotic processes and concluded none \nwas evident. Dr. T further concluded that, although Applicant appeared na\u00efve concerning his \nbeliefs about being surveilled, his mental state was healthy, and he did not fit the diagnosis for \nparanoia because he only expressed his paranoia about the IRS and not everything else in his life. \nOf the three medical assessments presented, the Judge indicated that he was giving the \ngreatest weight to Dr. S\u2019s diagnosis and opinions. He concluded Dr. S\u2019s opinion that Applicant \n2 \n\n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhas a mental health condition that impairs his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness was not \nmitigated by the evidence presented. \nDiscussion \nDue Process \nDr. S\u2019s evaluation indicated that she was basing her opinion on an interview, self-reported \nquestionnaires, a structured personality assessment, and medical records. Government Exhibit \n(GE) 7 at 1. In an email dated November 7, 2022, Applicant\u2019s Counsel requested a complete copy \nof all documents in possession of Dr. S. Correspondence File at 2. That same day, Department \nCounsel provided the following response: \nDoD Directive 5220.6, para E3.1.11 lay out the discovery rules: \u201cDiscovery by the \napplicant is limited to non-privileged documents and materials subject to control \nby the DOHA. Dr. [S\u2019s] files are not subject to control by the DOHA, so they are \nnot available through discovery.  [Id.] \nOn appeal, Applicant notes his discovery request and contends that the lack of the requested \ndocuments prevented his expert from being able to interpret the results of Dr. S\u2019s tests. To the \nextent that he is now claiming that his right to discovery was violated, Applicant waived this issue \nbecause he did not raise a motion at the hearing challenging the Government\u2019s response and the \nJudge did not have an opportunity to rule on this issue. See, e.g., DISCR OSD Case No. 90-0926 \nat 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 23, 1991) (failure to raise an abridgement of a discovery right at the hearing \nresulted in waiver of that issue). \nDr. T\u2019s Testimony and Report \nThe Judge concluded that AG \u00b6 29(c) \u2013 \u201crecent opinion by a duly qualified mental health \nprofessional employed by, or acceptable to and approved by, the U.S. Government that an \nindividual's previous condition is under control or in remission, and has a low probability of \nrecurrence or exacerbation\u201d \u2013 was partially applicable. Regarding this mitigating condition, the \nJudge also stated: \nApplicant presented the opinion of Dr. T, who performed a psychosocial \nassessment in December 2022. While Dr. T is a duly qualified mental-health \nprofessional (she is a licensed marriage and family therapist with a Ph.D. in \ncounseling, with years of counseling experience), there is no evidence that she is \nacceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government. I will take this qualifier into \nconsideration as to the weight I give to Dr. T\u2019s testimony and report. Dr. T \nconcluded that Applicant did not appear to present psychological symptoms that \nwould impair his judgment.  [Decision at 7.] \nOn appeal, Applicant contends the Judge erred in concluding that there was no evidence \nthat Dr. T was acceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government. He argues that the admission \nof Dr\u2019s T\u2019s report and her testimony into evidence without any Government objection \u201cwas \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nacceptance and approval by the U.S. government.\u201d Appeal Brief at 4. Based on the facts in this \ncase, this argument is not convincing. Applicant cites no authority in support of this contention. \nA party\u2019s decision not to object to evidence merely means that party has no opposition to the Judge \nadmitting the evidence into the record and considering it. A \u201cno objection\u201d assertion by an \nopposing party does not equate to approving, accepting, or otherwise validating that evidence. In \nthe present case, Department Counsel\u2019s \u201cno objection\u201d assertion to Dr. T\u2019s report did not establish \nthat Dr. T was \u201cacceptable to and approved by\u201d the U.S. Government. We find no error in the \nJudge\u2019s analysis of Dr. T\u2019s testimony and report.1 \nError in the Findings of Fact \nApplicant contends that the Judge erred in making two findings. First, Applicant claims \nthe Judge erred in finding he reported to his employer that the break-in of his truck in March 2020 \noccurred at a grocery store, while he told Dr. K it happened at a casino. A review of Applicant\u2019s \nletter to his employer (GE 4) and Dr. K\u2019s evaluation (GE 5 at 1) supports this challenged finding.  \nApplicant has failed to establish the Judge erred in making that finding. \nThe second purported error involves a finding that police officers questioned Applicant\u2019s \nupstairs neighbors about the break-ins. Applicant argues that police officers asked the neighbors \none question and \u201c[t]hat is hardly a \u2018questioning\u2019 by Police.\u201d Appeal Brief at 5. On this issue, Dr. \nK\u2019s report indicated that a police detective investigated Applicant\u2019s claim in March 2020. GE 5 \nat 1.  At the hearing, Applicant testified: \nTwo police officers came to my door at first and questioned me about it. But they \ndid not conduct any kind of investigation other than they went upstairs, they spoke \nto the individual that answered the door, and the question that I heard as I stood by \nthe door, my own door, was \u201cDo you have anything against the guy downstairs?\u201d \nAnd the individual said, \u201cNo.\u201d \nThe police officer proceeded to come downstairs and tell me to stay away from \nthese guys and then they left.  [Tr. at 132-133.] \nApplicant testified about what he heard of the exchange between the police officers and \nneighbor(s) from a different floor. It is unclear whether the police asked other questions that he \ndid not hear. Even if the Judge erred in making this finding, it was harmless because it did not \n1 The Appeal Board is cognizant of the possible predicament that an applicant may face regarding AG \u00b6 29(c). The \nBoard is aware of no designation of \u201cduly qualified mental health professionals [as] acceptable to and approved by\u201d \nthe U.S. Government, except for those who are employed by, or under contract with, the U.S. Government. We are \naware of no process for designating mental health professionals as \u201cacceptable to and approved by\u201d the U.S. \nGovernment. Nevertheless, some affirmative statement or action by a Government representative (not merely a \u201cno \nobjection\u201d assertion by Department Counsel to a proffered document) is needed to meet the \u201cacceptable to and \napproved by\u201d requirement. Absent the promulgation of regulations or procedures regarding this issue, it would appear \nthe best approach is for applicants or their representatives to coordinate first with Department Counsel about how to \nobtain such \u201cacceptance\u201d and \u201capproval\u201d prior to submitting evidence from a mental health professional. If that step \ndoes not lead to a successful resolution, the matter may be raised as a due process issue for the Administrative Judge \nto consider. Based on the record before us, this issue is not ripe for the Board\u2019s consideration. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nlikely affect the outcome of the case.

In doing so, he notes \nthe Judge concluded that \u201cthe record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance.\u201d Decision at 8. Applicant argues \n\u201c[q]uestions and doubts hardly meet any burden of proof.\u201d Appeal Brief at 5. This argument is \nnot persuasive. The Judge\u2019s conclusion regarding \u201cdoubts\u201d is based on well-established principles \nin security clearance adjudications. \nThe adjudicative guidelines address \u201csecurity concerns,\u201d which in the personnel security \ncontext are doubts about an applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility. AG \u00b6 2(b) specifically \nprovides, \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security eligibility will \nbe resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d Emphasis added. The U.S. Supreme Court \neffectively recognized the validity of the \u201cdoubt\u201d concept when it stated that the grant of a security \nclearance is a \u201c[p]redictive judgement . . . committed to the broad discretion of the agency \nresponsible\u201d and that \u201c[t]he clearly consistent standard indicates that security-clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 529 and 531 (1988). See also Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F.2d 1399, 1403 (9th Cir. \n1990) (\u201cthere is a strong presumption against the issuance or continuation of a security clearance\u201d). \nFurthermore, Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 provides that an applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of persuasion \nas to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Applicant\u2019s challenge to the Judge\u2019s \u201cdoubt\u201d \nconclusion does not establish any error. \nRegarding the Government\u2019s burden of proof, Dr. S\u2019s evaluation (GE 7) was sufficient \nsubstantial evidence to prove the facts alleged in the sole SOR allegation and to establish AG \u00b6 \n28(b), \u201can opinion of a duly qualified mental health professional that the individual has a condition \nthat may impair judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness.\u201d See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1 (setting forth \nthe substantial evidence standard). Once that disqualifying condition was proven, the burden of \nproduction shifted to Applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the resulting security \nconcerns.  Id. at E3.1.15. \nEvidence Did Not Support the Judge\u2019s Findings or Conclusions \nOn appeal, Applicant challenges Dr. S\u2019s evaluation. He notes that she did not testify, \ncontends that her report contains \u201cstatements which are either outright false or perversions of what \n[Applicant] told her in the 15 minutes she spent with him,\u201d and identifies the purportedly false or \ninaccurate statements. Appeal Brief at 6-7. These assertions amount to a disagreement with the \nJudge\u2019s weighing of the evidence. \u201cDetermining the weight and credibility of the evidence is the \nspecial province of the trier of fact.\u201d Inwood Laboratories, Inc. v. Ives Laboratories Inc., 456 U.S. \n844, 856 (1982). None of Applicant\u2019s arguments are sufficient to rebut the presumption that the \nJudge considered all of the record evidence or to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or \nreached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 19-01400 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 3, 2020).

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nBrittany D. Forrester, Esq. \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nMay 4, 2022, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that \ndecision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the National \nSecurity Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) of Security Executive Agent Directive 4 (effective June 8, \n2017) and DoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). The Government \nsubsequently amended the SOR to include cross-alleged security concerns under Guideline J \n(Criminal Conduct) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct). Applicant requested a hearing. On March \n27, 2023, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals Administrative Judge Roger C. Wesley denied \nApplicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 \nand E3.1.30. \nThe SOR alleged sixteen financial concerns totaling approximately $49,000, including \ndelinquent consumer and utility debt and a child support arrearage. The Judge found in favor of \nApplicant on six of the Guideline F allegations and against him on the remaining ten alleged \naccounts. The Judge also found in favor of Applicant on the Guideline J and Guideline E \nallegations, which are not at issue on appeal. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOn appeal, Applicant asserts that the Judge failed to properly consider all available \nevidence, rendering his adverse decision arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law, and failed to \nproperly apply the mitigating conditions and whole-person analysis. Consistent with the following, \nwe affirm. \nJudge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis \nApplicant is in his mid-40s. He served in the military from 1995 until his honorable \ndischarge in 2015. Applicant is twice divorced and has one adult child from his first marriage for \nwhom he provides support. He divorced his second wife in late 2015, was remarried in 2020 and \nhas a minor child and minor stepchild from his current marriage. Tr. at 36-41. Applicant has held \na security clearance since 2014, granted in conjunction with his former military service, and has \nbeen employed as a Reserve Officers Training Corps instructor since late 2019. Applicant\u2019s \nmonthly net income from all sources is approximately $7,300 and his wife\u2019s is approximately \n$4,000. Applicant also has over $20,000 in assets. \nThe Judge was unable to reconcile Applicant\u2019s minor progress in resolving his delinquent \naccounts with his available financial resources. Decision at 4. He concluded that mitigating \ncondition AG 20(b) was only partially applicable because, although Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems could \u201cbe attributed to extenuating circumstances,\u201d including \u201cproblems in finding work, \nhis increased family burdens, and his strained marriage that ultimately ended in divorce,\u201d \nApplicant failed \u201cto make more concerted efforts to address his debt delinquencies . . . with the \nassortment of monetary resources available to him.\u201d Decision at 9. Similarly, as of the close of the \nrecord, Applicant had \u201cnot made enough progress in addressing his delinquent debts to enable him \nto avail himself of the mitigating benefits of [AG] 20(d).\u201d Decision at 10. \nApplicant\u2019s Appeal \nChallenges to Findings of Fact \nOn appeal, Applicant challenges several of the Judge\u2019s factual findings. For example, \nApplicant takes issue with the Judge\u2019s calculations regarding the family\u2019s monthly income and \nexpenses, arguing that the Judge \u201cfailed to properly calculate the amount owed and [Applicant\u2019s] \nability to repay his creditors.\u201d Appeal Brief at 4. It appears that the Judge correctly assessed the \nfamily\u2019s combined monthly net income at approximately $11,300, but incorrectly assessed their \nmonthly expenses and thereby also incorrectly calculated their monthly net remainder. Based on \nApplicant\u2019s budget, his family\u2019s combined monthly expenses are approximately $9,000,1 and \ntherefore their combined net remainder is about $2,300, not $5,500 as calculated by the Judge. AE \nB. While the Judge\u2019s findings regarding Applicant\u2019s monthly expenses and remainder are \nerroneous, the error was harmless because it did not likely affect the outcome of the case. See, e.g., \nISCR Case No. 10-01021 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 18, 2011).

Indeed, the record supports that Applicant made few payments,2 and that \nhis remaining outstanding debts ranged from amounts as small as about $230 to as large as over \n$11,000. The record evidence therefore supports the Judge\u2019s conclusion that, \u201c[w]ith ample \nresources at his disposal to pay off the smaller debts and negotiate settlement arrangements with \nthe larger accounts, he has simply not been active enough about working with his creditor[s].\u201d \nDecision at 9-10. \nApplicant next argues that the Judge \u201coverlooked evidence that [he] paid off [an account] \nthat had a balance of $1,027.82.\u201d Appeal Brief at 4. The debt was not alleged in the SOR, and we \ninterpret Applicant\u2019s argument as seeking whole-person credit for resolving an additional debt. \nWhile this evidence was not, in fact, overlooked, we agree that the Judge misapplied it. \nSpecifically, the Judge found that Applicant had addressed SOR 1.a, a note loan placed for \ncollection for about $10,500. See GE 3 at 2.3 The Judge found favorably on this allegation, noting \nthat Applicant established a payment agreement for the debt and had \u201cmade three payments of \n$342 . . . in compliance with the agreement\u2019s terms.\u201d Decision at 4. The Judge appears to have \ninadvertently associated Applicant\u2019s post-hearing evidence regarding the non-alleged debt4 with \nthe $10,500 debt alleged at SOR 1.a. The Judge\u2019s favorable finding on SOR 1.a appears to rest on \nthe mistaken belief that Applicant had begun to address the debt; however, Applicant testified at \nhearing that he had not yet contacted the creditor or made any payments on the debt. Tr. at 49-50. \nThe Judge\u2019s favorable finding regarding SOR 1.a was therefore questionable and the total debt \nstill outstanding as of the hearing was approximately $42,700. Because this error inured to \nApplicant\u2019s benefit, it too is harmless. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-06259 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 8, \n2016). \nThe remainder of Applicant\u2019s challenges to the findings fail to establish any harmful error. \nThe Judge\u2019s material findings of security concern are \u201cbased upon substantial evidence or \nconstitute reasonable inferences or conclusions that could be drawn from the evidence.\u201d ISCR \nCase No. 12-03420 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 25, 2014). \nChallenges to Weighing of the Evidence \nApplicant also contends that the Judge erred in failing to comply with the provisions in \nExecutive Order 10865 and the Directive by not considering all the evidence and by not properly \napplying the mitigating conditions and Whole-Person Concept. For example, Applicant argues that \nthe Judge \u201cdid not place appropriate weight on the recency of [Applicant\u2019s] conduct,\u201d because he \n\u201cexperienced financial hardship due to his divorce from his ex-wife which created a snowball \neffect, starting in November 2016.\u201d Appeal Brief at 8. Applicant reiterates this argument \nthroughout his appeal, later asserting that MC 20(a) is \u201centirely applicable as the debt arose in \n2016 which is remote in time and under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur.\u201d Appeal \nBrief at 12. Contrary to Applicant\u2019s argument, however, the eleven debts that remain outstanding \n2 Applicant settled the debt alleged at SOR 1.j for $600, paid the debts alleged at SOR 1.m and 1.n for $214 and $156, \nrespectively, and brought his $2,955 child support arrearage current. \n3 As of January 2023, the debt remained in collection and the balance had increased to $11,792. See GE 5 at 7. \n4 Applicant\u2019s post-hearing documentation reflects a July 2022 payment confirmation from a different and unrelated \ncreditor, with payments of about $342 scheduled to be made in July, August, and September 2022.

See ISCR Case No. 09-01309 at 4 (App. Bd. Apr. \n29, 2010). \nApplicant\u2019s arguments on appeal advocate for an alternative weighing of the evidence, \nwhich is not enough to show that the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a \nmanner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007).

In the decision, the Judge noted Applicant \ndid not submit a response to the FORM. On appeal, Applicant indicates that he moved to a new \nlocation on August 1, 2022, and claims that he did not receive the FORM but would have replied \nhad he received it.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nChristopher Snowden, Esq. \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nApril 1, 2022, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis of that \ndecision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the National \nSecurity Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) in Appendix A of Security Executive Agent Directive 4, \neffective June 8, 2017, and DoD Directive 5220.6 (January 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). \nApplicant requested a hearing. On March 27, 2023, after close of the record, Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals Administrative Judge Darlene D. Lokey Anderson denied Applicant\u2019s \nrequest for a security clearance. Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nThe SOR alleged five delinquent debts. The Judge found favorably for Applicant on three \nand adversely on the other two, which total about $25,900. Applicant raises the following issue on \nappeal\u2014whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  \nConsistent with the following, we affirm. \nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis \nApplicant is in his mid-thirties. A high school graduate, he is seeking a security clearance \nfor the first time. Applicant earns $25 an hour and provides all financial support for his three \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nchildren and his girlfriend, who stays at home with their children. Applicant has financial \ndifficulties \u201ccaused by his impulsive and irresponsible purchases and not living within a budget.\u201d \nDecision at 2. For a fee of about $2,000, Applicant recently hired a credit repair agency to help \nhim settle and pay his delinquent debts. Applicant put an initial deposit of $200 towards this fee \nwith monthly payments to follow for 12 months. \nApplicant resolved three alleged debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b \u2013 d) in May and September 2022, after \nthe SOR was issued. Each of the three debts was below $1,000. The two remaining debts are both \nfor deficiency balances on auto loans. The first (SOR \u00b6 1.a) is for an electric vehicle that Applicant \npurchased in 2016. Within a few months of purchase, Applicant recognized that he could not afford \nthe monthly payments and that his access to a charging station was inadequate. He attempted to \nreturn the car to the creditor and was instructed to stop making payments. The car was then \nrepossessed and sold at auction, resulting in a deficiency of approximately $17,700. That debt is \nunresolved. Applicant then purchased a used car in March 2017, but was in an accident shortly \nthereafter. He was not insured. The vehicle was sold at auction for scraps, and Applicant owed the \ndeficiency of about $8,000. The creditor intends to send Applicant a Form 1099-C, and his credit \nreport indicates that the account was \u201clegally paid in full for less than the full balance.\u201d Id. at 3, \nciting Applicant Exhibit D. \nApplicant did not make efforts to resolve his debts until after receiving the SOR. Although \nhe recently hired a credit repair agency, Applicant still owes a significant sum to one creditor and \nhas not started to resolve that debt. \u201cNone of the mitigating conditions are applicable.\u201d Id. at 6. \nDiscussion \nIn his appeal brief, Applicant argues that the Judge erred in several findings of fact and \nthen relied upon those erroneous findings in her mitigation analysis. As one example, Applicant \nchallenges the Judge\u2019s finding that he began to resolve his debts only after he received the SOR in \nApril 2022. Applicant argues that he resolved the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b in September 2020, \nwell before issuance of the SOR, and that the Judge\u2019s erroneous finding permeated her mitigation \nanalysis. Appeal Brief at 5, 11, 12-13. The record, however, supports the Judge\u2019s finding that the \ndebt in question was paid in September 2022 and her conclusion that Applicant addressed the \nallegations only after issuance of the SOR. Applicant Exhibit B; Tr. at 39. Having examined the \nrecord and decision, we find no merit in any of Applicant\u2019s allegations of factual error. \nApplicant also argues that the Judge did not properly apply the mitigating conditions. He \nargues, for example, that the Judge \u201cmakes no finding on the recency of the debts\u201d and \u201cdoes not \nprovide a rational basis for how two auto loans from over six (6) years ago are indicative on the \n[Applicant] today.\u201d Appeal Brief at 11. It is well established, however, that an applicant\u2019s ongoing, \nunpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and can be viewed as recent for purposes of \nthe Guideline F mitigating conditions. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 13, \n2016). \nAdditionally, Applicant argues that the Judge failed to recognize his good-faith efforts to \nresolve the two auto loans, noting that he has started payments to a credit relief agency for the debt \nalleged at SOR \u00b6 1.a and will receive a FORM 1099-C for the debt alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.e.

Mar. 1, 2007). The Board declines to find that either an initial \npayment towards a credit repair agency\u2019s fee or the pending receipt of a FORM 1099-C for a \ncharged-off debt constitutes a good-faith effort to resolve debts. Id. \nThe debt alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.e is arguably resolved, as Applicant testified that he is pending \nreceipt of a FORM 1099-C and submitted a credit report supporting that assertion. Even assuming \nthat the deficiency was recently forgiven by the creditor, the Judge is not obligated to find \nfavorably for Applicant on the debt, as she may consider all the circumstances surrounding the \ndebt, including how it became delinquent and the manner in which it was ultimately resolved. See, \ne.g., ISCR Case No. 03-04704 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2005). \nNone of Applicant\u2019s arguments are sufficient to rebut the presumption that the Judge \nconsidered all of the evidence in the record nor are they enough to show that the Judge weighed \nthe evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. See, e.g., ISCR Case \nNo. 19-01400 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 3, 2020). Applicant failed to establish that the Judge committed \nany error or that he should be granted any relief on appeal. The Judge examined the relevant \nevidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision. His decision is sustainable on \nthe record. \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent \nwith national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nChristopher Snowden, Esq. \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nApril 5, 2022, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that \ndecision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) of the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG) of Security Executive Agent Directive 4 (effective June 8, 2017) \nand DoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). Applicant requested a hearing. \nOn April 25, 2023, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals Administrative Judge Ross D. Hyams \ndenied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 \nE3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant\u2019s mother and six siblings are resident citizens of Iraq and \nthat four of his siblings are employed either directly by the Iraqi government or by entities owned \nand operated by the same. The SOR further alleged that Applicant and his siblings have a financial \ninterest in real property located in Iraq. The Judge found in favor of Applicant with respect to the \nfinancial interest allegation, but against him on the remaining Guideline B concerns. \nOn appeal, Applicant asserts that the Judge failed to properly consider all available \nevidence, rendering his adverse decision arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law, and failed to \nproperly apply the mitigating conditions and whole-person analysis. For the reasons set forth \nbelow, we affirm. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nJudge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis \nApplicant, in his early 40s, was born, raised, and educated in Iraq. He earned his bachelor\u2019s \ndegree in 2005, and in 2008 started working for a company that serviced coalition military bases \nin Iraq. Due to his work on coalition bases, Applicant was threatened twice in 2010 and had to take \nsafety precautions. He was granted a special immigrant visa (SIV) by the United States in 2012. \nFrom his entry into the U.S. until 2018, Applicant worked for construction companies that sent \nhim on various overseas assignments, including in Iraq, for periods usually less than six months. \nHe worked in the U.S. from 2018 to 2021 and became a U.S. citizen in 2019. Since 2021, Applicant \nhas been employed by a government contractor and lives and works overseas. \nApplicant does not own a home in the U.S. He claimed to rent a room from a friend when \nvisiting the U.S. but had no lease and did not know his friend\u2019s last name. He maintains few close \ncontacts and modest financial assets in the U.S. \nApplicant\u2019s mother and his siblings and their families are Iraqi resident citizens. Four of \nhis siblings have jobs connected with the Iraqi Government. In his February 2020 security \nclearance application (SCA), Applicant disclosed regular and frequent contact with almost all of \nhis immediate family members; however, he testified at hearing to having reduced his contact with \nthem after applying for a security clearance because he thought it would assist his obtaining one. \nThe Judge took administrative notice of facts regarding Iraq including, among others, that \nthe U.S. Department of State has assessed Iraq as being a high threat, \u201cLevel 4: Do not travel\u201d \nlocation due to terrorism, kidnapping, armed conflict, civil unrest, and limited ability to assist U.S. \ncitizens in country; anti-U.S. sectarian militias threaten U.S. citizens and Western companies \nthroughout Iraq; and Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), militia groups, and criminal gangs \ntarget U.S. citizens for attacks and hostage-taking. A heightened security risk in Iraq was \nestablished by these facts. \nThe Judge found that Applicant\u2019s deep and longstanding connection to Iraq, including \nthrough close and continuing contact with his family, presents a conflict of interest and establishes \ndisqualifying conditions AG \u00b6 7(a) and AG \u00b6 7(b). In concluding that none of the mitigating \nconditions fully applied, the Judge noted that Applicant has spent a significant portion of his life \nin Iraq, including after immigrating to the United States, and his ties to the U.S. are comparatively \nlimited. Applicant also initially reported frequent contact with most of his family members, and \nhis \u201ctemporary limitation of communications with [them] during the processing of his security \nclearance\u201d failed to alleviate concerns about the associated risk for foreign influence or \nexploitation. Decision at 7-8. \nDiscussion \nApplicant\u2019s arguments on appeal can be parsed into three assignments of error, including \nthat the Judge failed to consider that: 1) Applicant\u2019s family themselves do not create a vulnerability \nof foreign pressure or coercion; 2) Applicant has limited contact with his family and therefore has \nno potential conflict of interest; and 3) Applicant was previously threatened while working on \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nbehalf of the U.S.1 As discussed more thoroughly below, Applicant\u2019s arguments amount to a \ndisagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, which is not sufficient to demonstrate \nthat the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, \ncapricious, or contrary to law. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007). \nPosition of Family in Iraq \nApplicant argues that the Judge failed to consider favorable evidence, including that his \nIraqi relatives do not ask him about his job and that those employed by entities associated with the \nIraqi Government work in professions, such as schoolteacher, accountant, and boat captain, that \nmake it unlikely that they will attempt to gain information related to Applicant\u2019s work. Appeal \nBrief at 9. Similarly, Applicant asserts that the Judge\u2019s analysis regarding mitigating condition AG \n\u00b6 8(a) is defective because it \u201cdoes not indicate whether [Applicant\u2019s] family members would be \ninterested in classified information, [or] whether they have sought classified information (or any \ninformation about [Applicant\u2019s] job).\u201d Appeal Brief at 11. \nIt is well-established that the Government is not required to prove an actual threat of \nespionage. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-13696 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 9, 2009). Rather, there is a \nrational connection between an applicant\u2019s family ties in a hostile country, even if that family has \nno connection with the foreign government, and the risk that the applicant might fail to safeguard \nclassified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-26893 at 7 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002) (\u201c[H]uman \nexperience shows that people have engaged in espionage or committed deliberate security \nviolations for a broad range of reasons, including succumbing to threats made by a foreign entity \nagainst a third party for whom the target has ties of love or affection.\u201d). Here, the Judge reasonably \nfound that Applicant has longstanding personal and family connections to Iraq, which given \ncurrent geopolitical circumstances presents a heightened risk,2 and concluded that Applicant failed \nto show it is unlikely he will be placed in a position of having to choose between those connections \nand the interests of the U.S. \nCommunication with Family in Iraq \nTurning to his communication with his family in Iraq, Applicant takes issue with the \nJudge\u2019s conclusion that his more limited contact is only \u201ctemporary.\u201d Appeal Brief at 10, 13. We \nagree that the record does not explicitly reflect that Applicant\u2019s reduced contact will change in the \nfuture;3 however, we do not find Applicant\u2019s challenge persuasive. The concern in Foreign \nInfluence cases arises from the nature of an applicant\u2019s foreign ties, which is not evinced by the \ncurrent state of communications in a vacuum. While frequency of contact is a factor to be \n1 Applicant claims to challenge several of the Judge\u2019s factual findings as \u201cwholly unsupported by the record.\u201d Appeal \nBrief at 8. These purported factual errors are merely disagreements with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence and are \ntherefore examined with his other arguments. \n2 In Foreign Influence cases, the nature of the foreign government involved, including its intelligence gathering history \nand human rights record, as well as the presence of terrorist activity in the country, provide context for the other record \nevidence and are among the important considerations for the Judge, including as part of the whole-person analysis. \nSee ISCR Case No. 05-03250 at 5 (App. Bd. Apr. 6, 2007). \n3 When asked if he intends to resume his prior level of contact with family if he is granted a security clearance, \nApplicant testified, without elaborating, that \u201cit depends.\u201d Tr. at 37. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconsidered in evaluating the concern, it alone is not dispositive. This leads to Applicant\u2019s next \nargument \u2013 that the Judge improperly relied on evidence about his contact with family members \nas drawn from his SCA instead of his hearing testimony. Appeal Brief at 8-9, 10, 12, 15. He \nappears to argue that his current reduced contact should be given greater weight than the more \nsignificant contact disclosed in his three-year-old SCA. We disagree. \nAn applicant\u2019s actions prior to the initiation of the security clearance process are \nilluminating of his or her unmotivated conduct and should be given weighty consideration. Indeed, \nthe Appeal Board has routinely held that the timing of an applicant\u2019s action in resolving security \nconcerns is relevant in evaluating its mitigative value. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-01911 at 6 \n(App. Bd. Nov. 4, 2020). At the start of his clearance process, Applicant reported having contact \nwith his mother and five of his siblings on at least a monthly, but more typically a weekly basis. \nSee Government Exhibit 1 at 31-41. This regular and frequent level of communication is indicative \nof the depth of Applicant\u2019s affection for his family in Iraq. His reduction in communication was \nnot due to any weakening of those bonds, but rather to improve his chances of obtaining a \nclearance. Tr. at 37. Further still, he maintains regular contact with one sister who facilitates his \ncontinued communication with his mother. Tr. at 23, 43. The evidence supports that Applicant\u2019s \nbonds of affection for his family in Iraq are ongoing, even where his communications are not. The \nJudge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant\u2019s family in Iraq create an unmitigated potential conflict of \ninterest is consistent with the record evidence. \nPrior Threats \nApplicant next contends that the Judge failed to consider that he previously received \ncredible threats related to his support of the U.S. and, despite having not yet received SIV status \nor being naturalized, he reported the threats and continued to work on behalf of the U.S. \ngovernment. Appeal Brief at 9, 12. This argument is without merit, as the Board has held that an \napplicant who has already been threatened by a foreign entity may encounter similar threats in the \nfuture and be pressured to compromise national security information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No 17\u00ad\n01981 at 5 (App. Bd. Dec. 17, 2019). \nFinally, Applicant argues that, considering his prior reporting of threats made against him, \nthe Judge erred in failing to analyze mitigating condition AG \u00b6 8(e). Appeal Brief at 14. A Judge \nneed not discuss all the potentially applicable analytical factors set forth in the Directive, including \nthe mitigating conditions and whole-person factors.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nPro se \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nApril 19, 2022, DoD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis of that \ndecision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the National \nSecurity Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) in Appendix A of Security Executive Agent Directive 4 \n(effective June 8, 2017) and DoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). On July \n7, 2023, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals Administrative Judge Roger C. Wesley denied \nApplicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility. Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and \nE3.1.30. \nThe SOR, as amended, alleged seven financial concerns, including two delinquent federal \nstudent loans, credit card debt, and a minor medical account, all totaling approximately $56,000. \nThe Judge found favorably on one credit card debt, but against Applicant on the remaining six \nallegations. \n\n \n \n \n \n            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nJudge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis \nApplicant is in his early 60s. He has been married since 1982 and has two adult children. \nApplicant earned an associate degree in 1993. He has worked for his current employer since 2007 \nand has held a security clearance since 2010. As of the hearing, Applicant\u2019s annual income was \napproximately $148,000 and he had a monthly net remainder of about $3,000 after all other \nexpenses were paid. \nThe Judge found that none of the mitigating conditions were fully applicable. Applicant \ndisplayed \u201cno well-developed financial plan or refined budget in place to aid him in mitigating the \nGovernment\u2019s financial concerns over his delinquent student loans,\u201d and that, with the exception \nof one consumer debt resolved for under $2,000 (SOR \u00b6 1.f), Applicant had \u201cmade no concerted \nefforts to resolve any of his delinquent consumer and medical debts with the ample resources \navailable to him over the past three years.\u201d Decision at 7. The Judge concluded that, in \nconsideration of the foregoing, Applicant had not mitigated the security concerns raised by his \nfinancial delinquencies. \nDiscussion \nOn appeal, Applicant first challenges the amount alleged as delinquent for his student loan \nat SOR \u00b6 1.c and asserts that the correct balance is about $10,455. Indeed, when the SOR was \noriginally issued, a typographical error inaccurately alleged that this debt carried a balance of about \n$16,309. In recognition of this, the Government moved to amend SOR \u00b6 1.c to reflect the correct \namount of $10,455, and that motion was granted. Applicant\u2019s challenge in this regard is therefore \nmoot. Applicant also asserts that the debt alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.f has been paid; however, the Judge \nfound favorably on this allegation and therefore this challenge is also moot. \nApplicant next takes issue with the Judge\u2019s finding that his annual income was $148,000, \narguing that this amount includes benefits paid by his employer and that his annual income is \nactually only about $138,000. When asked about his income and expenses at hearing, Applicant \ntestified that his annual salary was $148,000 and that his monthly net income was roughly $8,000. \nTr. at 38, 51. The findings regarding Applicant\u2019s income and available financial resources were \ntherefore based on substantial evidence, namely Applicant\u2019s own unrebutted testimony. To the \nextent that Applicant is attempting to revise that amount on appeal, such a revision amounts to \nnew evidence and fails, as set forth further below. \nFinally, Applicant submits new evidence in the form of a narrative and documentary update \non the status of his student loans and other debts. The Appeal Board does not review cases de novo \nand is prohibited from considering new evidence on appeal. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29. \nApplicant has not established that the Judge committed harmful error. Our review of the \nrecord reflects that the Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory \nexplanation for the decision, which is sustainable on this record. \u201cThe general standard is that a \nclearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d \nDepartment of the Navy v.

For the reasons stated below, we reverse the Judge\u2019s decision. \nBackground and Analysis \nApplicant is in his mid-30s and has earned both bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees. He was \ngranted a security clearance in 2011 while employed with a previous defense contractor and has \nworked for his current defense contractor employer since 2015. \nAs part of his periodic reinvestigation, Applicant completed a new security clearance \napplication (SCA) on March 8, 2021, wherein he disclosed that he started using marijuana in or \naround April 2017 and last used the drug the month prior to completing his SCA. Applicant \nacknowledged that his use occurred while possessing a security clearance and indicated that he \nintended to use the drug in the future, noting that he \u201canticipate[d] THC to be removed from [the] \nlist of controlled substances in the near future.\u201d Government Exhibit (GE) 1 at 38. \nDuring the corresponding interview three weeks later, Applicant explained that he used \nmarijuana at home and \u201cwould take THC in the form of a tablet . . . about 2-3 nights a week.\u201d GE \n2 at 8. He had used marijuana again since completing his latest SCA, and he expressed it was \n\u201clikely\u201d that he would continue to use the drug in the future to help regulate his sleep, but he was \nwilling to abstain if that was \u201ca requirement to maintain a clearance.\u201d Id. \nIn a subsequent response to interrogatories, Applicant disclosed that he last used marijuana \nin approximately June 2021, three months after his aforementioned clearance interview. Id. at 4. \nHe again acknowledged that his use occurred while possessing a security clearance, but averred \nthat he had stopped using marijuana and had no intention to use again in the future. Id. \nThe Judge found that Applicant used marijuana about 50 times \u201cfrom approximately mid\u00ad\nto-late 2017 to August 2018, and again from November 2020 to June 2021,\u201d and that his clearance \nwas active during the time he was using the drug. Decision at 3, 5. From August 2018 to November \n2020, Applicant resided in a state where marijuana was illegal under state law, and he abstained. \nDecision at 2-3. The Judge found that \u201cApplicant has abstained from any marijuana use since [June \n2021] and evinced a credible intent not to use marijuana in the future.\u201d Decision at 3. Relying on \nGuideline H mitigating conditions 26(a) and 26(b), the Judge concluded that Applicant\u2019s \u201cconduct \nwas in the past and he stated convincingly that it will not be repeated.\u201d Decision at 6. He reached \na similar conclusion in applying Guideline E mitigating conditions 17(c) and 17(d). Decision at 7. \nThese conditions address similar concepts \u2013 that the concerning behavior was so minor or \nhappened so long ago, so infrequently, or under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur; and \nthat the applicant acknowledged the concerning behavior and provided evidence of actions taken \nto overcome the problem. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDiscussion \nThere is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance. See \nDorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After \nthe Government produces evidence raising security concerns, an applicant bears the burden of \npersuasion concerning mitigation. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The standard applicable in security \nclearance decisions is that a clearance may be granted only when \u201cclearly consistent with the \ninterests of the national security.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). \n\u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security eligibility will be resolved \nin favor of the national security.\u201d AG \u00b6 2(b). \nA Judge\u2019s decision can be found to be arbitrary or capricious if it \u201cfails to examine relevant \nevidence, fails to articulate a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made, \nfails to be based on a consideration of relevant factors, involves a clear error of judgment, fails to \nconsider an important aspect of the case, or is so implausible as to indicate more than a mere \ndifference of opinion.\u201d ISCR Case No. 94-0215 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Apr. 13, 1995) (citing Motor \nVehicle Mfr. Ass\u2019n v. State Farm Mut. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)). On appeal, the \nGovernment argues that the Judge\u2019s treatment of the Guideline H and E mitigating conditions was \nnot supported by the totality of the record evidence. We find this argument to be persuasive. \nThe Judge appears to have reached his favorable decision by leaning heavily on Applicant\u2019s \npositive attributes, such as being \u201cviewed as a solid performer by his employer\u201d and \u201crespected by \nhis coworkers and supervisors,\u201d and having \u201crepeatedly received recognition for his job \nperformance.\u201d Decision at 3, 6. In doing so, however, the Judge failed to meaningfully address \nhow Applicant\u2019s decision to start and continue using marijuana while holding a security clearance \nwas mitigated other than by asserting that Applicant\u2019s use, which last occurred only about 15 \nmonths prior to the hearing, was \u201cin the past.\u201d Decision at 6, 7. While a Judge may conclude that \nthe record supports a favorable decision through the whole-person analysis (see, e.g., ISCR Case \nNo. 16-02243 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Nov. 30, 2018)), such analysis requires \u201cconsideration of the \nevidence as a whole, not just those pieces of evidence that support a Judge\u2019s final decision.\u201d ISCR \nCase No. 94-1213 at 4 (App. Bd. Jun. 7, 1996). \nThere is no question that Applicant understood that his marijuana use was inconsistent with \nholding a security clearance. Indeed, Applicant testified at hearing that he was aware that \nmarijuana is illegal under Federal law. Tr. at 42. When asked why he continued to use marijuana \nnot only after he completed his 2021 SCA, but also after the subsequent clearance interview despite \nunderstanding throughout that time that the drug is a violation of Federal law, Applicant replied, \n\u201cIt was working. It was helpful for my sleep. As much as I did understand that it was illegal under \nFederal Law, I was benefitting from it.\u201d Tr. at 46-48. The Appeal Board has \u201clong held that \napplicants who use marijuana after having been placed on notice of the security significance of \nsuch conduct may be lacking in the judgment and reliability expected of those with access to \nclassified information.\u201d ISCR Case No. 20-01772 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 14, 2021). See also ISCR \nCase No. 21-02534 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 13, 2023) (\u201c[A]fter applying for a security clearance and \nbeing adequately placed on notice that such conduct was inconsistent with holding a security \nclearance, an applicant who continues to use marijuana demonstrates a disregard for security \nclearance eligibility standards, and such behavior raises substantial questions about the applicant\u2019s \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \njudgment, reliability, and willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\u201d). The Judge\u2019s \nanalysis failed entirely to address the substantial questions raised by Applicant\u2019s conduct. \nThe record reflects that Applicant knew at the time he was using marijuana that it was \nprohibited by Federal law. He began purchasing and using marijuana while holding a security \nclearance and continued to do so well into his current reinvestigation, despite having been \nrepeatedly placed on notice that such conduct was inconsistent with holding a security clearance. \nWe note that, in rendering his favorable decision, the Judge took notice of the Security Executive \nAgent\u2019s December 2021 Clarifying Guidance Concerning Marijuana for Agencies Conducting \nAdjudications of Persons Proposed for Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position, which instructs that \u201cprior recreational marijuana use by \nan individual may be relevant to [security clearance] adjudications but not determinative.\u201d \nNotwithstanding this clarifying guidance, Applicant\u2019s conduct \u2013 including his marijuana use while \nholding a security clearance and continuing well into his latest clearance reinvestigation, all of \nwhich was in knowing violation of Federal law and security clearance standards \u2013 raises \nunmitigated security concerns. \nConsidering the record as a whole, we conclude that the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary and \ncapricious. The decision fails to consider important aspects of the case and runs contrary to the \nweight of the record evidence and is not sustainable. \nOrder \nThe Judge\u2019s favorable security clearance decision is REVERSED. \nSigned: James F.

On \nSeptember 7, 2023, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals Administrative Judge Philip J. \nKatauskas denied Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility. Applicant appealed pursuant to \nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nThe SOR alleged four financial concerns, including that Applicant failed to file her Federal \nincome tax return for tax year 2013, that she was indebted to the Federal Government and her state \ntax authority for delinquent taxes beginning in 2009 for approximately $35,000 and $37,000, \nrespectively, and that she had one minor delinquent consumer debt. Noting that Applicant had \nresolved the consumer and state tax debts, and had filed her 2013 Federal tax return, the Judge \nfound favorably for her on those allegations.

Accordingly, the \nJudge found against Applicant regarding her Federal tax debt and concluded that the security \nconcerns raised thereby were not mitigated. \nOn appeal, Applicant challenges the Judge\u2019s analysis under the Whole-Person Concept, \narguing that the adverse decision focused solely on financial considerations, but the totality of her \npersonal and professional history demonstrates that she meets the standards necessary to be granted \neligibility for access to classified information.

Dorsey denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  \nApplicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. For reasons stated below, we \naffirm the decision. \nThe Judge found in favor of Applicant on the Guideline G allegations. In responding to \nthe SOR, Applicant admitted the Guideline E and J allegations with explanations. However, his \nresponse to a domestic abuse allegation amounts to a denial because he claimed he did not commit \nany abuse. The Judge found against Applicant on the Guideline E and J allegations, concluding \nthat none of the potentially applicable mitigating conditions applied and that the record evidence \nraised doubts about his security clearance eligibility \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn his appeal brief, Applicant presents new evidence, which the Appeal Board is prohibited \nfrom considering.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.  Applicant also presents arguments challenging aspects of \nthe Guideline E and J allegations that are addressed below. \nFraudulently Obtaining a Professional Certification and Employment Resignation \nRegarding these allegations, the Judge stated: \nApplicant paid another individual to take a certification exam for him that \nwas either required by his employer or would benefit his standing with his \nemployer. He gained the certification under false pretenses. He then resigned from \nhis employment [in April 2021] based upon this untrustworthy behavior. [Decision \nat 5.] \nIn his brief, Applicant contends the Judge found \u201cthat I did not self-report\u201d this conduct. \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant \u201cself-reported\u201d this fraudulent behavior. Furthermore, the Judge \nfound that, \u201cApplicant reported this conduct to his employer, apologized for his behavior, . . . [but \nit] is unclear from the record whether he reported this conduct prior to being confronted with it.\u201d \nDecision at 2. To the extent that Applicant is challenging the Judge\u2019s finding regarding the timing \nor sequencing of the self-reporting, he has failed to identify any evidence in the record to show the \nJudge erred in that finding. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.30 requires that an appeal brief state the specific \nissues being raised and cite specific portions of the record supporting any alleged error. \nAdditionally, there is no presumption of error below, and the appealing party has the burden of \ndemonstrating that the Judge committed factual or legal error. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 00-0339 \nat 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 22, 2001). In this case, Applicant has failed to meet that burden regarding the \nGuideline E allegations.  \nDomestic Abuse Incident \nRegarding this allegation, the Judge found: \nIn about September 2017, Applicant physically assaulted his ex-spouse after \ngetting into an argument with her. Applicant\u2019s ex-spouse alleged that he body-\nslammed her, causing her to strike her arm heavily on a dresser and the floor. \nApplicant claimed that he did not touch his ex-spouse, and that she struck him.  \n[Decision at 2.] \nOn appeal, Applicant again contends that he never assaulted his ex-spouse and argues that \nshe assaulted him. In doing so, he highlights that he was never charged with any offense due to \nthis incident and states that his ex-spouse was having an intimate relationship with the military \npolice officer who arrested him. In the findings of fact, the Judge noted that, when the military \npolice arrived at the scene, they noticed bruising on the ex-spouse\u2019s arm and scratches on \nApplicant\u2019s arm, that he told the police that he and his ex-spouse did not have domestic abuse \nissues in the past but contradicted that statement during his counseling with a social worker, and \nthat a military \u201cFamily Advocacy Program Case Review Committee determined that Applicant\u2019s \n2 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nex-spouse qualified as a victim of physical abuse based on this incident\u201d and that she was \nauthorized compensation as a family member who was physically abused by a military member. \nDecision at 3. The Judge concluded that the evidence corroborated the spouse\u2019s version of the \nevents and that Applicant was not truthful about the incident, which undercut his mitigating \nevidence. Decision at 7. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1 requires the Appeal Board to give deference to a \nJudge\u2019s credibility determinations. We find no basis for not giving such deference in this case. \nFrom our review of the record, the Judge\u2019s material findings and conclusions of a security concern \nregarding the domestic abuse allegation are based on substantial evidence or constitute reasonable \ninferences that could be drawn from the evidence. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-02225 at 2-3 (App. \nBd. Jun. 25, 2019). \nDriving While Intoxicated \nIn 2017, Applicant drove a vehicle while intoxicated by alcohol. He was stopped on post \nby military police and breathalyzer tests registered blood alcohol content levels of .116, .102, and \n.092. At a nonjudicial punishment proceeding, he was reduced in rank and was awarded 45 days \nof extra duty and restriction. In 2018, he was administratively separated from the military with a \ngeneral discharge under honorable conditions.  Decision at 2. \nApplicant\u2019s brief highlights that these events occurred five years ago, that he has attended \ncounseling, including mental-health counseling, and that he now drinks responsibly. A security \nclearance decision must be based upon consideration of all the relevant and material information.  \nDirective \u00b6 6.3. Applicant\u2019s arguments fail to establish that the Judge weighed the evidence in a \nmanner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.3.  \nConclusion \nApplicant\u2019s brief states that revoking his security clearance will negatively impact not only \nhim but also his family. The Directive, however, does not permit us to consider the impact of an \nunfavorable decision. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-03024 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 9, 2020).  \nApplicant failed to establish that the Judge committed any harmful error or that he merits \nany relief. The Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation \nfor the decision. The decision is sustainable on the record. \u201cThe general standard is that a \nclearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with national security.\u2019\u201d Department of \nthe Navy v.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nAlan V. Edmunds, Esq. \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nJuly 20, 2022, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that \ndecision\u2015security concerns raised under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption) and Guideline J \n(Criminal Conduct) of the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) in Appendix A of \nSecurity Executive Agent Directive 4 (effective June 8, 2017) and DoD Directive 5220.6 (January \n2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). On August 30, 2023, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \nAdministrative Judge Edward W. Loughran denied Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility. \nApplicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nThe SOR alleged five alcohol-related arrests, and cross alleged the same allegations under \nGuideline J. The SOR was amended on December 22, 2022, to allege under Guideline J that \nApplicant was separated from the military for misconduct (drug abuse); and under Guideline H \n(Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse) that Applicant used synthetic marijuana in 2010 while \ngranted access to classified information. The Judge found in favor of Applicant on the drug abuse \nallegation, and against him on the alcohol and criminal conduct allegations. On appeal, Applicant \nasserts that the Judge failed to properly consider all available evidence and applied facts not in \nevidence rendering his adverse decision arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law; and failed to \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nproperly apply the mitigating conditions and whole-person analysis. Consistent with the following, \nwe affirm. \nJudge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis \nApplicant is in his mid-thirties, has been employed by a defense contractor since 2020, and \npreviously served on active duty in the military from 2007 to 2011. He is currently pursuing a \nsecond master\u2019s degree. He is unmarried and does not have any children. The Judge found that \nApplicant has a history of substance abuse, alcohol-related incidents, and criminal conduct. In \n2011, he received non-judicial punishment while on active duty for his use of synthetic marijuana \nknown as \u201cspice.\u201d \nApplicant was arrested and convicted of driving under the influence in 2013. He was \ndrinking in a bar/restaurant when he attempted to drive home. The manager called a taxi and \nencouraged Applicant not to drive or he would call the police. Applicant refused the taxi and drove \nanyway. The police stopped him after seeing his erratic driving and noted a strong odor of alcohol \nand signs of intoxication. Applicant stumbled out of the car with his zipper down and refused field \nsobriety, breath, and blood tests. He pleaded guilty or no contest and received a deferred sentence, \na fine, and one year of unsupervised probation. In testimony, he did not recall details of the incident \nor if he was intoxicated when he left the restaurant. \nIn 2014, Applicant was arrested, charged, and pled guilty to public drunkenness. He could \nrecall few details of what occurred during the incident. In 2016, he was charged and convicted of \npublic intoxication. He gave inconsistent testimony in his attempts to explain his actions that night \nthat resulted in him walking from a bar/restaurant after drinking, in 44-degree temperatures, \nshoeless, and with mud around his legs to his knees. Applicant was again arrested for driving while \nintoxicated (with a blood alcohol concentration of .15% or greater) in 2017. He pleaded guilty to \na lesser offense and was sentenced to 180 days confinement that was suspended, one year of \nprobation, and fined. \nIn 2020, Applicant was arrested for public intoxication after being involved in a fight \noutside a bar. An acquaintance was trying to prevent Applicant from driving while intoxicated. \nApplicant admitted to police that he had \u201ca lot to drink, he was intoxicated, and he planned to drive \nhome until he was stopped by the other individual,\u201d but denied in his response to the SOR that he \nwas \u201cbinge drinking or drinking to excess.\u201d He pleaded no contest or guilty to the charge and was \nfined, but in testimony he had little memory of the incident. \nApplicant admitted to drinking issues but said he did not believe he is an alcoholic and \ndoes not believe he currently has a drinking problem. He signed a statement of discontinued \ndrinking and intended to abstain from alcohol use in the future. He said he maintained sobriety for \nmore than a year, which he described as not drinking to intoxication. However, in May 2023, he \nhad three beers at a baseball game. The Judge noted that he did not find Applicant to be credible, \nand that the reports of his conduct were more reliable than his explanations. \nThe Judge found under Guideline G that Applicant\u2019s drinking and poor judgment exhibited \nwhile drinking were not sufficiently mitigated to overcome concerns about his alcohol use, \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, and honesty. The Judge noted that Applicant\u2019s alcohol-\nrelated misconduct is serious, and it would be difficult to find such conduct mitigated, even if he \nbelieved Applicant. The Judge used the same analysis under Guideline J. Although he found that \nApplicant will not likely use illegal drugs again, it falls into his pattern of substance abuse and \ndisregard for the law. He also said he did not believe Applicant\u2019s testimony and found that \nApplicant\u2019s criminal conduct including his illegal drug abuse, continues to cast doubt on his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. He found the mitigating conditions, individually or collectively, were insufficient \nto alleviate the Guideline J concerns. Finally, the Judge held that Applicant\u2019s drug involvement \nunder Guideline H was mitigated because it occurred more than 12 years ago, and that he has \nabstained from illegal drug use for an appropriate period. \nDiscussion \nOn appeal, Applicant first alleges the Judge failed to consider all relevant evidence and \nerroneously applied the mitigating factors. Specifically, he claims the Judge did not consider the \n\u201cvast circumstances relating to the [Applicant\u2019s] positive steps that have been taken to ensure that \nthe security concerns against him were mitigated,\u201d and the Judge \u201cimproperly considered the \nApplicant\u2019s lack of [m]emory surrounding the events as the deciding factor in deciding that the \nApplicant was not suitable for clearance.\u201d Appeal Brief at 7. He argues that \u201c[w]hile the encounters \nwith the law due to intoxication raise concerns under alcohol use (Guideline G) and criminal \nconduct (Guideline J); it is the Administrative Judge\u2019s position to consider the record evidence as \na whole and not view the information in a fragmented piecemeal fashion.\u201d Appeal Brief at 8. \nApplicant points to his negative Phosphatidyl Ethanol (PETH) alcohol tests as evidence of \nthe positive steps he has taken since the 2020 incident to show he has learned habits to assist with \npositive outlets for his stress, grief, and PTSD that has triggered his alcohol abuse. Id. Applicant \nalso argues that his lack of \u201cincidents\u201d since 2020, academic and professional achievements over \nthe past three years, modified consumption and positive support network mitigated the Guideline \nG concerns. Applicant also argues that the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary and capricious because it \nfails to \u201cproperly\u201d account for mitigating evidence such as Applicant\u2019s \u201crehabilitation efforts, \ncounseling, evaluation, favorable prognosis, [Applicant\u2019s] remorse, [Applicant\u2019s] testimonial \ncandor, and the Administrative Judge\u2019s clear disregard for the record as a whole.\u201d Id. at 10. \nApplicant\u2019s three negative PETH tests from February, June, and July 2023 were admitted \ninto the record (Applicant Exhibits (AE) J and O). There is a rebuttable presumption that the Judge \nconsidered all of the record evidence, and that presumption is not rebutted merely because the \nappealing party can point to information in the record that was not mentioned in the Judge\u2019s \ndecision. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-09781 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 25, 2002). It is also well-\nestablished that \u201c[d]etermining the weight and credibility of the evidence is the special province \nof the trier of fact.\u201d Inwood Labs., Inc. v. Ives Labs., Inc., 456 U.S. 844, 856 (1982). \nIn addition to the evidence discussed above that reflects on Applicant\u2019s candor, the record \ncontains numerous conflicts between Applicant\u2019s accounts and other record evidence. The Judge \nnoted Applicant\u2019s two alcohol-related driving offenses, refusal of assistance from his friend and \nthe staff at the bar on two other occasions, and apparent intent to drive intoxicated if not arrested. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDecision at 7. Applicant also stated in his response to the SOR that \u201cit was in his best interest to \nrefrain from alcohol consumption entirely\u201d and signed a statement of intent in August 2022 to \ndiscontinue drinking and abstain from alcohol use in the future. See, AE D. He thereafter testified \nthat he maintained sobriety for more than a year but admitted to drinking three beers at a baseball \ngame in 2023. The Judge found it difficult to find Applicant credible. When conflicts exist within \nthe record, a judge must weigh the evidence and resolve conflicts \u201cbased upon a careful evaluation \nof factors such as the comparative reliability, plausibility and ultimate truthfulness of conflicting \npieces of evidence.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-06723 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 14, 2007). Here, the Judge\u2019s \nresolution of conflicts between Applicant\u2019s account and official records was reasonable and \nsustainable. We find no reason not to give deference to the Judge\u2019s negative credibility \ndetermination regarding Applicant. \nApplicant\u2019s assertion that the Judge\u2019s factual findings are unsupported by the record is \nunfounded. He claims that the Judge \u201cimproperly broadly applied that the [Applicant\u2019s] lack of \ncredibility equated to an unfavorable adjudication of alcohol-related allegations.\u201d Appeal Brief at \n8. Specifically, Applicant takes issue with the Judge\u2019s comment with respect to Applicant\u2019s poor \nmemory and argues that \u201cit is reasonable to have poor memory and recollection of events that \ntranspired while the Applicant was drinking.\u201d Id. This appears to be additional argument \nchallenging the Judge\u2019s interpretation and weight of the evidence, and his creditability \ndeterminations that are well-reasoned and consistent with the AG and Directive. As we have \nexplained before, there is a difference between errors in a judge\u2019s findings of fact and errors in the \nconclusions drawn therefrom. See ISCR Case No. 22-00822 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 5, 2023). Findings \nof fact must be supported by substantial evidence, while conclusions are reasonable inferences \ndrawn from the evidence. See ISCR Case No. 18-00496 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 8, 2019), citing \nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.32.1 and E3.1.32.3. \nFinally, Applicant argues the Judge\u2019s analysis of the mitigating conditions and whole-\nperson analysis are unsupported by the record evidence and were analyzed in an unreasonable and \nfragmented manner. Appeal Brief at 10. Applicant\u2019s arguments regarding the Judge\u2019s application \nof mitigating and whole-person factors amounts to a disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of \nthe evidence, which is not sufficient to demonstrate that the Judge weighed the evidence or reached \nconclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007). \nApplicant has not established that the Judge committed harmful error. The Judge examined \nthe relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision, and the record \nevidence supports that the Judge\u2019s findings and conclusions are sustainable. \u201cThe general standard \nis that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national \nsecurity.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). \u201cAny doubt concerning \npersonnel being considered for national security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d AG \u00b6 2(b). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOrder \nThe decision is AFFIRMED. \nSigned: James F.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nRyan C. Nerney, Esq. \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nSeptember 30, 2022, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for \nthat decision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) of Security Executive Agent Directive 4 \n(effective June 8, 2017) and DoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). On July \n12, 2023, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals Administrative Judge Edward W. Loughran \ndenied Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility. Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 \nE3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nThe SOR alleged five tax liens filed against Applicant, including three Federal liens filed \nin August and December 2012 totaling approximately $84,000 and two state liens filed in April \n2011 and September 2012 totaling approximately $69,000. The SOR further alleged that Applicant \nreceived a Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge in 2013. The Judge found against Applicant on the \nthree Federal tax liens, and in favor of her on the remaining allegations. On appeal, Applicant \nasserts that the Judge failed to properly consider all relevant evidence and failed to properly apply \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n            \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe mitigating conditions, rendering his adverse decision arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. \nConsistent with the following, we affirm. \nJudge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis \nApplicant is in her mid-50s. She is married and has one adult child. She has worked for her \ncurrent employer or a predecessor company since 2012. \nIn 2008, Applicant purchased a restaurant, where she had previously worked as a waitress \nand manager, for about $1.2 million. She paid $150,000 down and financed the balance for about \n$10,000 per month. Applicant began having difficulty maintaining the restaurant due to the \nrecession and because a highway bypass diverted drivers around her small town. She stopped \npaying the restaurant\u2019s property taxes, and she also stopped paying the Internal Revenue Service \nand state taxing authority the payroll taxes she withheld from her employees\u2019 wages. Applicant \nreturned the restaurant to its prior owners after they threatened to foreclose in 2012. \nApplicant retained an attorney, who negotiated an offer-in-compromise with her state \ntaxing authority to address the state tax liens. She completed payments on the negotiated amount \nin 2016, and the state liens were released in December 2020. With respect to the Federal liens, \nApplicant contacted the IRS several times and was told in 2017 and 2018 that she owed so much \nin comparison to her income that the IRS considered the liens uncollectable. The IRS indicated \nthat it would maintain the liens on Applicant\u2019s property so that it could collect the profit from any \nsale, and it would withhold any refunds she would otherwise receive, but that it would not actively \ncollect on the liens unless Applicant\u2019s income significantly increased. She was also told that the \nIRS could not collect taxes after ten years, and she decided to not make any payments and wait \nuntil the debts were more than ten years old and uncollectable. \nThe Judge found that the failure of Applicant\u2019s restaurant was a circumstance beyond her \ncontrol and left her in a difficult situation, but her not paying payroll taxes was not an acceptable \noption. Moreover, \u201cApplicant has done nothing to resolve the federal payroll taxes . . . except to \nwait until they become more than ten years old and uncollectable.\u201d Decision at 6. The Judge was \ntherefore unable to find that Applicant acted responsibly under the circumstances, nor that she \nmade a good-faith effort to pay the payroll taxes. Because no mitigating conditions could be \napplied to the unpaid payroll taxes, the Judge concluded that Applicant\u2019s financial issues continue \nto case doubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nDiscussion \nOn appeal, Applicant contends that the Judge erred in failing to apply mitigating conditions \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), and 20(g). Applicant\u2019s arguments, as discussed more below, amount to a \ndisagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, which is not sufficient to demonstrate \nthat the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, \ncapricious, or contrary to law. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007). \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant first asserts that the Judge erred in declining to apply mitigating condition AG \u00b6 \n20(a), arguing that the \u201cevidence establishes that there were unique circumstances that heavily \ncontributed to the outstanding tax debt, such as the recession and the failure of [Applicant\u2019s] \nrestaurant in 2012.\u201d Appeal Brief at 11. A judge need not discuss all potentially applicable \nanalytical factors set forth in the Directive, including the mitigating conditions. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 12-05512 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2017) (citation omitted). Additionally, AG \u00b6 20(a) was \nof limited application because Applicant\u2019s Federal tax liens, all of which were entered in 2012, \nremained unresolved as of the hearing. The liens therefore represented a continuing course of \nconduct, which undermines any argument that Applicant\u2019s tax debts are not recent or are unlikely \nto recur. See ISCR Case No. 09-01309 at 4 (App. Bd. Apr. 29, 2010). \nApplicant next challenges the Judge\u2019s finding that mitigating condition AG \u00b6 20(b) did not \napply to her Federal tax debt. AG \u00b6 20(b) applies when 1) the conditions that resulted in the \nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control, and 2) the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances. The Judge acknowledged that the \u201cfailure of Applicant\u2019s restaurant was \nbeyond her control,\u201d satisfying the condition\u2019s first prong. Decision at 5. The Judge went on to \nfind, however, that Applicant\u2019s initial decision to not pay payroll taxes, and her subsequent \ninaction in resolving the Federal liens other than through waiting until they became more than ten \nyears old and uncollectable, were insufficient to invoke the second, \u201cresponsible action\u201d prong of \nAG \u00b6 20(b). \nApplicant argues that \u201cdespite the Administrative Judge\u2019s erroneous assertions to the \ncontrary, [Applicant] acted reasonably and responsibly under the circumstances to resolve the \noutstanding debts.\u201d Appeal Brief at 12. Throughout her appeal, Applicant repeatedly emphasizes \nthat she contacted the IRS several times in hopes of resolving the Federal tax liens but was told \nthat the IRS considered the debt uncollectable. See Appeal Brief at 4-5, 12. Beyond that, she took \nno other action to resolve the liens. She appears to contend that these IRS contacts amount to \nresponsible action under AG \u00b6 20(b)\u2019s second prong, warranting full application of the mitigating \ncondition. Applicant simply disagrees with the weight that the Judge placed on her limited \nresolution efforts, which, as previously stated, is insufficient to demonstrate that the Judge\u2019s \ndecision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. \nFinally, Applicant contends that the Judge erred by not applying AG \u00b6 20(g), which affords \nmitigation when \u201cthe individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority to . . . \npay the amount owed and is in compliance with those arrangements.\u201d While acknowledging that \nshe has made no such repayment arrangements with the IRS, Applicant contends that she should \nreceive credit under AG \u00b6 20(g) because her inability to resolve the Federal tax debt was \u201cthrough \nno fault of her own.\u201d Appeal Brief at 13. Applicant\u2019s argument is without merit. The plain language \nof the mitigating condition would require in this case demonstrated compliance with repayment \narrangements that have actually been established, not just attempted. Neither an actual repayment \narrangement nor compliance therewith exist in this case. \nApplicant\u2019s brief relies on hearing-level decisions in unrelated Guideline F cases to argue \nthat the Judge erred in his analysis of this case. Her reliance on those decisions is misplaced. The \nfacts and concerns at issue in the cited cases are easily distinguishable from the instant case. \nMoreover, how particular fact scenarios were decided at the hearing level in other cases is \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ngenerally not a relevant consideration in the Board\u2019s review of a case.

The SOR further alleged under Guideline E that Applicant \ndeliberately failed to disclose the foregoing marijuana use on her 2017 and 2021 security clearance \napplications (SCAs) and failed to disclose her use while possessing a security clearance on the \nlatter SCA.

In completing her 2017 SCA, Applicant answered \u201cNo\u201d to the \nquestion seeking disclosure of any drug use in the prior seven years. Decision at 3.

During her subject interview later in March 2021, \nhowever, Applicant disclosed that she had continued to use marijuana, including into the current \nmonth during a hike on a family trip. She explained that she had not disclosed the information in \nher SCA three weeks earlier because it was discussed during her prior clearance investigation and \nbecause she did not realize that marijuana use was prohibited because she resided in California at \nthe time.

Applicant asserted that she \u201crarely consumed [marijuana] for recreational purposes,\u201d \nbut it was usually for \u201crelief from intense menstrual cramps.\u201d Id. \nApplicant\u2019s Appeal: Guideline E \nThe Judge found Applicant\u2019s responses to all three of the SCA questions to be willful \nfalsifications and concluded that none of the relevant Guideline E mitigating conditions applied. \nDecision at 2, 6. On appeal, Applicant contends that the Judge erred by not properly applying the \nmitigating conditions and Whole-Person Concept. \nApplicant\u2019s arguments on appeal amount to a disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of \nthe evidence, which is not sufficient to demonstrate that the Judge weighed the evidence or reached \nconclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007). For example, Applicant argues that Mitigating Condition \n17(a) applies because she \u201cvoluntarily self-reported marijuana use during [her] interview \nimmediately upon receiving clarification from the interviewer.\u201d Appeal Brief at 1.

Jul. 26, 2005). \nHere, the Judge was not swayed by Applicant\u2019s explanation that she \u201cdidn\u2019t understand marijuana \nto be an illegal drug\u201d when completing her 2017 SCA, or that she still \u201cdidn\u2019t understand . . . that \n[marijuana use] was illegal and something to report\u201d when she completed her 2021 SCA.

Instead, the Judge concluded that Applicant \u201cfalsified her [SCA] in 2017 as to her past drug \ninvolvement, and continued this ruse by falsifying her 2021 [SCA].\u201d Decision at 6. \nThe Appeal Board gives deference to a Judge\u2019s credibility determination (Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.32.1), and we find no reason to disturb the Judge\u2019s unfavorable credibility determination in \nconcluding that Applicant deliberately falsified her SCAs. The Judge\u2019s material Guideline E \nfindings are based upon substantial record evidence or constitute reasonable inferences or \nconclusions that could be drawn from the evidence. \nApplicant has not established that the Judge committed harmful error. The Judge examined \nthe relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision under Guideline \nE, and the Judge\u2019s ultimate adverse decision is sustainable on this record. \u201cThe general standard \nis that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national \nsecurity.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v.

Decision at 4. Thereafter, the burden shifted to Applicant to present \nevidence of refutation, extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances sufficient to overcome \nthe case against her. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-30587 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 15, 2005) (citing \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15). Applicant explained that she used marijuana beginning in 2008 recreationally \nand to treat menstrual pain, but asserted that she last used the drug in March 2021. At hearing, she \nprovided a Statement of Intent against future illegal drug use and submitted three negative drug \ntest results from June and September 2022. Decision at 2. Relying on mitigating conditions 26(a) \nand 26(b), the Judge concluded that Applicant\u2019s past marijuana use was \u201cnot of present security \nsignificance\u201d because the \u201clast marijuana usage was . . . 14 months prior to the issuance of the \nSOR\u201d and Applicant \u201cprovided a signed statement of intent to abstain from future drug \ninvolvement and three negative drug tests.\u201d Decision at 5. On cross-appeal, the Government argues \nthat the Judge\u2019s analysis under Guideline H, and specifically his application of the mitigating \nconditions, did not consider significant contrary evidence. Cross-Appeal Brief at 9-10. We agree. \nA Judge\u2019s decision can be found to be arbitrary or capricious if it \u201cfails to examine relevant \nevidence, fails to articulate a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made, \nfails to be based on a consideration of relevant factors, involves a clear error of judgment, fails to \n1 Applicant attached to her appeal two documents that were submitted at hearing as Applicant Exhibits K and L, which \nshe believes may have been overlooked by the Judge in his whole-person analysis.

Apr. 13, 1995) (citing Motor \nVehicle Mfr. Ass\u2019n v. State Farm Mut. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)). \nIn reaching his favorable decision under Guideline H, the Judge failed to address several \nconcerning and conflicting aspects of the case. For instance, the Judge failed to address how \nApplicant\u2019s continued marijuana use after completing her initial SCA and while holding a security \nclearance was mitigated, other than by generally citing the 14 months of abstinence that Applicant \nclaimed prior to the SOR being issued. The Appeal Board has \u201clong held that applicants who use \nmarijuana after having been placed on notice of the security significance of such conduct may be \nlacking in the judgment and reliability expected of those with access to classified information.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 20-01772 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 14, 2021). See also ISCR Case No. 21-02534 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Feb. 13, 2023) (\u201c[A]fter applying for a security clearance and being adequately placed \non notice that such conduct was inconsistent with holding a security clearance, an applicant who \ncontinues to use marijuana demonstrates a disregard for security clearance eligibility standards, \nand such behavior raises substantial questions about the applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\u201d). Here, Applicant\u2019s marijuana use \ncontinued not only after completing her 2017 SCA and being placed on notice that such use was \ninconsistent with holding a security clearance, but it continued during the intervening four years \nwhen she was granted her clearance and when she began her 2021 reinvestigation. \nMoreover, Applicant\u2019s marijuana use continued despite her pervious assertion that she had \nno intent to use illegal drugs in the future. To that end, the Judge\u2019s analysis also failed to address \nwhy he found Applicant\u2019s recent Statement of Intent to abstain from future drug use credible \nconsidering the similar broken promise Applicant made during her 2017 investigation. See, e.g., \nISCR Case No. 19-02499 at 5 (App. Bd.

As already stated, the Board typically gives deference to a Judge\u2019s credibility \ndetermination (Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1); however, that deference is not without limits. When the \nrecord contains a basis to question an applicant\u2019s credibility, the Judge \u201cshould address that aspect \nof the record explicitly,\u201d explaining why he finds an applicant\u2019s explanation to be trustworthy. \nISCR Case No. 07-10158 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 28, 2008). Here, the basis to question Applicant\u2019s \ncredibility rested in the Judge\u2019s unfavorable findings under Guideline E. It is well settled that \nfalsification of a security questionnaire constitutes misconduct that casts serious doubt on an \napplicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-06852 at 3 (App. \nBd. Aug. 21, 2002); ISCR Case No. 02-07555 at 4 (App. Bd.

Having found that Applicant deliberately falsified not one, but \ntwo security clearance applications, the Judge implicitly opined about Applicant\u2019s lack of \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ntrustworthiness and should have explained his reasons for believing her most recent claim of \nabstinence and the promises advanced in her Statement of Intent. \nConsidering the record as a whole, we conclude that the Judge\u2019s Guideline H decision is \narbitrary and capricious. The Judge\u2019s Guideline H analysis fails to articulate a rational connection \nbetween the facts found and the choice made, fails to consider important aspects of the case, and \nruns contrary to the weight of the record evidence.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nPro se \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nJuly 5, 2022, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that \ndecision\u2015security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of DoD Directive \n5220.6 (January 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). Applicant requested a decision on the written \nrecord. On March 21, 2023, after considering the record, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) Administrative Judge Candace Le\u2019i Garcia concluded that it is not clearly consistent with \nthe national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Applicant appealed \npursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether he was denied due process and \nwhether the Judge\u2019s decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. Consistent with the \nfollowing, we affirm. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant had 14 delinquent debts, including four student loans \ntotaling about $11,000, seven consumer debts totaling about $6,500, a child support arrearage of \nabout $250, and two judgments totaling about $17,700. The Judge found in favor of Applicant on \nthe child support arrearage, noting he had been making payments on that debt for several months, \nand found against him on the remaining debts. In her analysis, the Judge found that Applicant \nindicated he paid the student loans and two other debts but did not provide documentation to \ncorroborate those claims, that he did not provide any information about three other debts, and that \nhe indicated that he did not feel obligated to resolve two older debts and intended to wait for them \nto fall off his credit report. After first citing Appeal Board decisions holding that it is reasonable \nfor a judge to expect an applicant to present documentation showing resolution of specific debts \nand that merely waiting for debts to fall off a credit report is not favorable mitigating evidence of \ndebt resolution, the Judge concluded that Applicant\u2019s debts continue to cast doubt on his current \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nJurisdiction and Due Process \nCiting to Directive \u00b6 2.6, Applicant asserts that the Directive did not apply to him because \nhe has access to sensitive compartmented information. Under the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 2.3 and 3.1, \nhowever, DOHA has jurisdiction over security clearance determinations that the Defense \nCounterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA) Consolidated Adjudication Services (CAS)1 \nforwards to it involving applicants who hold or require access to classified information in \nconnection with their employment in the private sector.  Applicant\u2019s adjudication falls under such \nauthority. Said differently, DOHA has jurisdiction under the Directive to determine Applicant\u2019s \nsecurity clearance eligibility.    \nApplicant\u2019s appeal brief essentially claims that he was denied due process. In general, he \ncontends that he was not given adequate notice of the reasons for revoking his security clearance \nand was not given an adequate opportunity to respond to those reasons. More specifically, he \nclaims he was not given an opportunity to respond to Department Counsel\u2019s File of Relevant \nMaterial (FORM).  We do not find these arguments persuasive. \nAs noted above, the SOR was issued in July 2022. It adequately placed Applicant on notice \nof the reasons why the DoD Consolidated Adjudication Facility (now DCSA CAS) was unable to \nfind that it was clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him access to classified \ninformation; advised him that his case would be submitted to an Administrative Judge for a \ndetermination as to whether his security clearance should be granted, denied, or revoked; and \nforwarded to him a copy of the Directive, which sets forth the security clearance adjudication \nguidelines and procedures. On September 28, 2022, Applicant responded to the SOR by admitting \nor denying the Guideline F allegations with comments and by providing one corroborating \ndocument that showed payments on the child support arrearage. FORM Item 2. In responding to \nthe SOR, he was also provided the opportunity to request either a hearing before an Administrative \nJudge or a decision by the Administrative Judge based on the written record. He elected the latter \noption. Id. \n1 The personnel security clearance adjudication functions that were previously performed by the Defense Industrial \nSecurity Clearance Office (referenced in Directive \u00b6 2.3) are now performed by DCSA CAS. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOn November 4, 2022, Department Counsel\u2019s FORM was mailed to Applicant. It \ncontained Department Counsel\u2019s arguments regarding Applicant\u2019s security clearance worthiness \nand a copy of all relevant and material supporting evidence, including four credit reports produced \nbetween October 2020 and October 2022, court records regarding the judgments, and Applicant\u2019s \nresponses to interrogatories. The FORM and its forwarding letter advised Applicant that he had \n30 days from its receipt to file objections or submit any additional evidence in rebuttal, \nexplanation, extenuation, or mitigation, and, in the absence a response, the Judge\u2019s decision would \nbe \u201cbased solely on [the] FORM.\u201d \nIn his brief, Applicant appears to claim that he did not receive the FORM and was not given \nan opportunity to respond to it.  He states, \u201cI recently started the position [at a defense contractor] \nand was still in processing with the contractor at this time and I was not onsite. I was not physically \nonsite until around Nov[ember] 14, 2022, so this is likely part of the reason I was not able to \nrespond if any notifications were sent to my prior email on my previous contract with the \n[military].\u201d Appeal Brief at 2. However, on November 30, 2022, Applicant signed a receipt for \nthe FORM in which he provided his mailing address as well as work and alternate email addresses \nand telephone numbers. Correspondence File at 4. Having received the FORM on that date, he \nwas required to submit his response to DOHA no later than December 30, 2022. Applicant did \nnot submit any information within 30 days of receiving the FORM. DOHA Director Memorandum \nof January 20, 2023. \nIn short, Applicant was provided adequate notice of, and opportunity to be heard on, the \nreasons for revoking his security clearance eligibility. There is no basis to conclude that he was \ndenied any due process rights afforded under the Directive. We resolve these assignments of error \nadversely to Applicant. \nNew Evidence \nApplicant\u2019s brief contains documents and assertions that were not presented to the Judge \nfor consideration. The Appeal Board is prohibited from receiving or considering such new \nevidence.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.  \nAnalytical Issues \nIn his appeal brief, Applicant argues that his student loans were paid, and his other debts \nwere either minor or were incurred more than seven years ago. He contends that the Judge\u2019s \ndecision does not properly account for such matters. However, as noted above, the FORM apprised \nApplicant of the documents and information that would be submitted to the Judge for a clearance \ndetermination. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the burden was on Applicant to submit rebuttal, \nmitigation, or any other evidence that he wanted the Judge to consider that was not in the FORM, \nand he failed to submit such a response. We find no error in the Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant \nfailed to submit sufficient evidence of debt resolution to mitigate the security concerns arising \nfrom the alleged debts. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant contends that the Judge failed to consider all the relevant factors in making her \ndecision and misapplied the adjudicative guidelines.

None of his arguments are enough to rebut \nthe presumption that the Judge considered all of the record evidence or to demonstrate the Judge \nweighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. See, e.g., \nISCR Case No. 21-01169 at 5 (App. Bd. May 13, 2022). Applicant states that holding a clearance \nis critical to his livelihood.

Although the \nJudge found against Applicant on both allegations, he determined that Applicant timely filed his \n2017 Federal income tax return.

Judge\u2019s Findings and Analysis Applicant is in his late-30s and has been employed by a defense contractor since April 2020. He graduated from a military academy and served on active duty until November 2012. He has been offered employment by a defense contractor contingent on verification of his security clearance. He was married in 2009 and divorced in 2013. His only child lives with his ex-wife. In 2003, while Applicant was attending a military academy preparatory school, he was disciplined by his military supervisor for underage drinking.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nWilliam H. Miller, Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nChristopher Snowden, Esq. \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nAugust 3, 2022, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that \ndecision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption) and Guideline J \n(Criminal Conduct) of the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) in Appendix A of \nSecurity Executive Agent Directive 4 (effective June 8, 2017) and DoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, \n1992, as amended) (Directive). Applicant requested a hearing. On June 6, 2023, Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals Administrative Judge LeRoy F. Foreman granted Applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility. The Government appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nThe SOR alleged eight alcohol-related incidents; a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder-\nmoderate; four criminal charges not involving alcohol-related conduct; and cross-alleged four \nGuideline G allegations under Guideline J. The Judge found in favor of Applicant on each of the \nallegations. On appeal, the Government argues the Judge improperly weighed the evidence; failed \nto consider relevant evidence in applying mitigation; and ignored relevant facts in the whole-\nperson analysis. Consistent with the following, we reverse the Judge\u2019s decision. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nJudge\u2019s Findings and Analysis \nApplicant is in his late-30s and has been employed by a defense contractor since April \n2020. He graduated from a military academy and served on active duty until November 2012. He \nhas been offered employment by a defense contractor contingent on verification of his security \nclearance. He was married in 2009 and divorced in 2013. His only child lives with his ex-wife. \nIn 2003, while Applicant was attending a military academy preparatory school, he was \ndisciplined by his military supervisor for underage drinking. While Applicant was on active duty, \nhe became intoxicated between missions once or twice a month but had no alcohol-related \ndisciplinary actions. \nIn 2012, Applicant was arrested for assault and battery on a family member and violating \nprotective orders. These incidents resulted from disputes over their divorce. He said his spouse \nscreamed at him and tried to hit him, but he fended her off. His spouse called police and he left the \nhome. His spouse filed charges for assault and battery and obtained a protective order, which he \nviolated. However, the charges were dismissed. Alcohol was not involved in these incidents. \nIn January 2013, Applicant was again charged with violating the protective order. His \nspouse called police when Applicant sent a friend to her home to retrieve items. Applicant was \nconvicted and sentenced to 30 days confinement; 28 days suspended. \nIn March 2013, Applicant was convicted of driving while intoxicated (DWI), first offense. \nHe drove a vehicle from a tow-away zone to another parking area, after drinking. He was arrested \nand registered a blood-alcohol level of .14% on a breathalyzer. He was sentenced to confinement \nfor one year, suspended, and unsupervised probation for 12 months. His driver\u2019s license was \nsuspended for one year, and he was required to install an ignition interlock on his vehicle and \nattend an alcohol safety action program. \nIn March 2014, Applicant had a positive reading on his ignition interlock resulting in \nreferral for substance abuse treatment and counseling and extended breathalyzer testing. He \nattributed the positive reading to using mouthwash at work before driving home. He was required \nto attend weekly group therapy and Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings. He completed the \nprogram in June 2014. \nIn July 2015, Applicant was charged with being drunk in public. He said he consumed \nabout four drinks with friends and was \u201cslightly buzzed\u201d at the time he was arrested. Someone \naccused him of trying to break into cars, and the police found him arguing with a group of people. \nHe was found not guilty of the charge but ordered to seek counseling and treatment. He attended \nweekly counseling for one year until August 2016 and completed the program. \nIn March 2017, Applicant was charged with being drunk in public. He was riding a bicycle \nin a park with friends when he was stopped by police because he and his friends were loud. He \ntestified that he had consumed \u201cone or two drinks.\u201d Decision at 3, citing Tr. at 37. He was found \nguilty in general district court, but appealed to the circuit court, pleaded not guilty, and the charge \nwas dismissed. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nIn November 2017, Applicant was charged with DWI, second offense, after drinking at his \ngirlfriend\u2019s apartment and sleeping in his car because he was too intoxicated to drive. He was \nfound not guilty of the offense. \nIn March 2019, Applicant was charged with being drunk in public and fleeing from law \nenforcement officers after drinking about six beers at a bar with friends. He testified that he did \nnot believe he was \u201coverly intoxicated.\u201d As they were walking to their bicycles, they were \napproached by police. He ran but was tackled and arrested. He was found not guilty of fleeing \nfrom police, and the drunk in public charge was dismissed. \nIn December 2019, Applicant was again charged with DWI, second offense. He was \nstopped by police for a taillight violation, and a field sobriety test was performed. Applicant \nrefused the breathalyzer test and was charged with refusing to do so. He testified that he had \nconsumed three drinks. He was held in confinement for a week before being released on bail. \nWhile awaiting trial, he was required to abstain from alcohol and seek counseling. Both charges \nwere disposed of by nolle prosequi.1 \nIn March 2020, Applicant was charged with assault and battery on a family member. He \nwas sitting in his car with his girlfriend, now his fianc\u00e9e, who accused him of cheating on her. She \nstarted screaming and hitting herself in the face. At the hearing, his fianc\u00e9e testified that she suffers \nfrom anxiety and depression and hurts herself when upset. She said Applicant was shouting at her \nand trying to get her to stop. Witnesses to the incident saw her bleeding and concluded that \nApplicant had injured her. The charge was disposed of by nolle prosequi in January 2021. While \nawaiting trial on this charge, Applicant attended AA meetings in 2020 and had a sponsor but \nstopped all counseling or treatment thereafter. \nApplicant testified that he stopped associating with his \u201cbar-hopping\u201d friends, and focuses \non his cybersecurity career, working out, and adopting healthier habits. He is supported by a former \nsupervisor and his direct supervisor. Additionally, his fianc\u00e9e\u2019s mother, a practicing physician for \n30 years who is familiar with his past alcohol problems, testified to his sobriety and said he has \nturned his life around. \nIn February 2022, Applicant was evaluated by a government-approved psychologist while \nthe DWI and breathalyzer refusal charges were pending. Applicant was diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder \u2013 moderate. The psychologist concluded that he had not been able to abstain from \nalcohol for more than six months at any time in his adult life, despite DWI charges, alcohol \neducation courses, treatment programs, a requirement for monthly urinalysis tests, and a court \norder to abstain from alcohol until his court date for the charges of assaulting his girlfriend. In \ntestimony, Applicant disagreed that he continued drinking, and testified that he stopped drinking \nin early 2020 except for a champagne toast at a New Year\u2019s Day celebration for an unrecalled year \nor years. The Judge took administrative notice of the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for alcohol use \ndisorder. He said the psychologist did not specifically identify which diagnostic criteria he relied \non to make his diagnosis. \n1 Notably, the arresting officer resigned during the pendency of the case.

In addition, the Judge concluded that Applicant has significantly curtailed his use \nof alcohol, there have been no similar incidents since December 2019, and he is supported by his \nfuture mother-in-law. \nRegarding the 2017 DWI charge and the 2020 domestic assault charge, the Judge \nconcluded there was no reliable evidence to support those allegations. In his whole person analysis, \nthe Judge noted Applicant\u2019s sincerity and candor, the change to his social life since his arrest in \nDecember 2019, his involvement in a serious relationship, and the support of his former supervisor \nand his fianc\u00e9e\u2019s mother, who was a compelling witness in favor of Applicant\u2019s rehabilitation. \nDiscussion \nA judge has broad discretion in weighing evidence, and the Appeal Board is required to \ngive deference to a Judge\u2019s credibility determinations. However, such discretion or deference is \nnot unlimited. A judge is not free to draw whatever inferences and conclusions he wants and \n\u201ccannot simply ignore, disregard, or fail to discuss significant record evidence that a reasonable \nperson could expect to be taken into account in reaching a fair and reasoned decision.\u201d ISCR Case \nNo. 02-22603 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Sep. 3, 2004). See also ISCR Case No. 99-0511 at 13-14 (App. Bd. \nDec. 19, 2000) (citations omitted). \nIn deciding whether rulings or conclusions are erroneous, we will review the judge\u2019s \ndecision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a \nsatisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts \nfound and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of \njudgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the \ndecision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed \nto a mere difference of opinion. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 97-0435 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 14, 1998) \n(citing Motor Vehicle Mfr. Ass\u2019n v. State Farm Mut. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)). On appeal, \nthe Government contends that, under Guideline G and J, the Judge erred in applying mitigating \nconditions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law, and unsupported by the \ntotality of the evidence. \n2 We note that Applicant\u2019s ex-wife has custody of his minor child, so the opportunity for future interactions with her \nare likely more than minimal. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRecency of Alcohol Consumption \nIn analyzing the Guideline G allegations, the Judge concluded two mitigating conditions \napplied. These are AG \u00b6 23(a), \u201cso much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on \nthe individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment;\u201d and AG \u00b6 23(d), \u201cthe individual \nhas successfully completed a treatment program along with any required aftercare, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance \nwith treatment recommendations.\u201d The Government challenges the Judge\u2019s application of those \nconditions. We agree the Judge erred in his analysis of these conditions. \nApplication of both mitigating conditions is largely based on the Judge\u2019s key conclusion \nthat Applicant \u201chas not consumed alcohol since his arrest for DWI in December 2019, more than \nthree years ago, except for one or more isolated incidents involving a New Year\u2019s champagne \ntoast.\u201d Decision at 8. In reaching that conclusion, however, the Judge did not make specific \nfindings about, or appropriately analyze, the contradictory evidence in the psychologist\u2019s \nevaluation of February 2022. Specifically, the evaluation contains the following statements: \n1. \u201cSubject currently drinks approximately once per month, usually on special \noccasions. He admitted that his drinking has reduced recently due to his legal issues \n. . . . However, he admitted that \u201cwhen I drink, I may drink a lot\u201d. GE 7 at 2. \n2. \u201cBy report, Subject\u2019s longest period of abstinence was 4-6 months within a \ncontrolled environment (deployment) and he has continued to consume alcohol, \ndespite his latest DWI in 2019 and the instructions that he should stay sober until \nhis adjudication.\u201d Id. at 4. \n3. \u201cWhile no legal consequences were formalized against him for [some] incidents, \nhe does not deny that he had been drinking when the incidents occurred. Of greater \nconcern, is the fact that the Subject has not been able to achieve a period of \nabstinence greater than 6 months at any point in his life despite completing alcohol \neducational courses, attending treatment programs, and being charged with his \nDWIs. The Subject admitted that he still drinks despite being required to take \nmonthly uranalysis tests and being ordered by the court to remain abstinent until \nhis court date. As such, this Evaluator cannot provide a favorable recommendation \nas he meets criteria for an [Alcohol Use Disorder] which inherently presents a threat \nto his judgment and reliability.\u201d Id. at 5. \nAs a related matter, the psychologist also stated: \nThe results of the personality assessment indicated that the Subject answered the \nquestions in a manner that presented himself in a consistently favorable light. He \nmay be reluctant to admit to minor faults or personal problems. This type of \ndefensiveness did not invalidate the assessment but indicated that attention should \nbe directed toward the possibility of denial in areas of alcohol/drug use.

When asked \nwhether he continued to drink alcohol as stated in the evaluation, Applicant responded, \u201cThat is \nincorrect, actually. I mentioned that I was not drinking alcohol because I was not allowed to, but I \nconsidered having a champagne toast on New Year\u2019s, and that would be about it, and that\u2019s what \nI was referring to.\u201d Tr. at 49. Applicant was not asked if he had an explanation, nor did he provide \none, for the discrepancy between the amount of his alcohol consumption reported in the \npsychologist\u2019s evaluation and the amount he stated during his testimony at the hearing. Id. at \n49-50. The Judge accepted Applicant\u2019s claim that the psychological evaluation was incorrect \nwithout addressing the specific statements in the evaluation. More specifically, in making a finding \nthat Applicant \u201cdisagreed\u201d with the psychologist\u2019s statement about his continued drinking, the \nJudge neither made findings about the details of Applicant\u2019s continued alcohol consumption as \nreflected in the psychological evaluation nor conducted any analysis of this significant discrepancy \nin the evidence.  Decision at 5. \nIn conducting mental health evaluations of individuals with possible alcohol use disorders, \npsychologists are likely to focus on the individual\u2019s current rate of alcohol consumption and the \nlength of any periods of abstinence. The amount of Applicant\u2019s then-level of alcohol consumption \nwas a focal point in his 2022 psychological evaluation. The psychological report is quite specific \non that issue, indicating that Applicant \u201ccurrently drinks approximately once per month, usually \non special occasions,\u201d that his \u201clongest period of abstinence was 4-6 months with a controlled \nenvironment (deployment),\u201d and that he has continued to drink alcohol \u201cdespite being required to \ntake monthly uranalysis tests and being ordered by the court to remain abstinent until his court \ndate.\u201d Such details reflect that the psychologist was cognizant of legal restrictions and other \npertinent circumstances regarding Applicant\u2019s alcohol consumption. These details provide indicia \nof reliability to the evaluation\u2019s statements about Applicant\u2019s alcohol consumption and also make \nit unlikely the psychologist may have mistakenly interpreted or reported what Applicant told him \nregarding such consumption. A reasonable person would expect the Judge to address this \nsignificant discrepancy as a key issue. The Judge erred in failing to conduct such an analysis, which \nundermines his application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 23(a) and 23(d). \nSuccessfully Completed a Treatment Program \nIn applying AG \u00b6 23(d), the Judge also concluded that Applicant completed a treatment \nprogram in 2016, which was apparently based on an estimated date in Applicant\u2019s security \nclearance application. GE 1 at 45. This, however, is not the correct year. Regarding alcohol \ntreatment, the Judge found Applicant was required to attend an Alcohol Safety Action Program \nafter his 2013 DWI conviction and to attend weekly group therapy and bimonthly AA meetings \nfollowing his 2014 ignition interlock violation. Decision at 3; GE 5 at 3; Tr. at 29, 51-52. The \nJudge also found that Applicant \u201cattended weekly counseling from August 2015 to August 2016 \nand completed the treatment program\u201d after a 2015 drunk in public charge. Decision at 3. However, \nApplicant testified that he did not attend alcohol treatment counseling after the 2015 drunk in \npublic charge. Tr. at 51-52. Applicant further testified that, other than attending AA meetings in \n2020, he had no other alcohol treatment or counseling besides that mentioned above. Id. at 51-52. \nEven if the finding that Applicant completed a treatment program in 2016 had not been rebutted \nby his own testimony, a conclusion that Applicant successfully completed a treatment program in \n2016 is dubious because he had four alcohol-related arrests between 2017 and 2019.   \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRecency of Criminal Conduct \nIn analyzing the Guideline J allegations regarding Applicant\u2019s 2019 DWI charge and 2020 \nAssault and Battery-Family charge, the Judge applied AG \u00b6 32(d), \u201cno reliable evidence to support \nthat the individual committed the offense.\u201d These charges were significant in the mitigation \nanalysis because they were the most recent and, if established, would undermine a conclusion that \nso much time has passed to make it unlikely such conduct will recur. The Government contends \nthat Judge erred in concluding there was no reliable evidence supporting these charges. We agree. \nRegarding Applicant\u2019s 2019 DWI charges, the Judge placed significant weight on the fact \nApplicant\u2019s level of intoxication was not established and the charges were nolle prosequi. Decision \nat 8. However, the Judge did not fully address that Applicant (1) admitted to drinking and driving \non that occasion, testifying that he had three drinks before he was stopped by police (Tr. at 42); \n(2) that he failed at least some aspects of the field sobriety tests (Id.; GE 2 at 11; GE 7 at 3); (3) \nthat he refused take a breathalyzer test (GE 2 at 11) and was charged with refusing to do so (GE 8 \nat 13); and (4) that he was arrested and incarcerated for about a week on these charges (Tr. at 41). \nAt the time of his psychological evaluation in 2022, these charges were still pending, and Applicant \nreportedly told the psychologist that \u201c[h]e intends to take a plea deal which will likely result in \nfines and alcohol education.\u201d GE 7 at 3; Tr. 42-43. The court record for the DWI charge reflects \nthe Judge ordered \u201ca nolle prosequi on prosecution\u2019s motion . . . officer resigned.\u201d GE 4 at 2 \n(emphasis added). Considering the record as a whole, there is substantial evidence to establish that \nApplicant committed the 2019 DWI offense. The Judge erred in applying AG \u00b6 32(d) to the 2019 \nDWI charge. \nAs for the 2020 domestic violence charge, the Judge made findings about Applicant\u2019s then-\ngirlfriend, now fianc\u00e9e, testifying about her finding a condom wrapper in his car, suspecting him \nof cheating on her, and experiencing an emotional breakdown in which she started screaming and \nhitting herself in the face, scratching her face, and pulling out her hair. Her testimony, however, \nvaries significantly from the police report of the incident, which states: \n[The police officer] responded to . . . Starbucks for an assault and battery between \nthe victim . . . and boyfriend suspect . . . . On scene, the victim was found in the \nStarbucks bathroom bleeding from the head. The victim stated she found an empty \ncondom wrapper in [Applicant\u2019s] vehicle, when she asked him why it was there a \nphysical altercation ensued. The suspect from the passenger seat struck the victim \n. . . in the forehead & mouth 5-7 times with a closed fist. The victim balled up \nbefore [/] until the altercation stopped. Suspect left scene shortly after, prior to PD \narrival.  [GE 3 at 3.] \nFirst, it merits noting that the above quote was a sworn statement of the police officer, and \nhe also stated, \u201cBy swearing to these facts, I agree to appear in court and testify if a warrant or \nsummons is issued.\u201d Id. Second, Directive \u00b6 6.3 provides that \u201c[e]ach clearance decision must be \na . . . common sense determination based upon consideration of all the relevant and material \ninformation . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Victims of domestic violence have been known to change \ntheir stories or to decide not to cooperate with authorities after considering potential legal, \neconomic, and domestic consequences that may arise if their partners are prosecuted. In this case, \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nthe victim signed a document that she did not want to press charges before the criminal trial, and \nshe testified at the DOHA hearing that she told the police that she hurt herself even though the \npolice report only reflects Applicant assaulted her. Tr at 61; GE 3. It is fair to say that the victim\u2019s \nstatement to the police was taken immediately after the event, while she was still suffering from \nthe effects of the injuries incurred during that event. The brief period between the incident and the \nvictim\u2019s statement to the police are indicia that the statement was reliably remembered and that \nthere was little time for fabrication. Third, Applicant departed the scene before the police arrived \ndespite claiming his girlfriend had an emotional breakdown and injured herself. In this \ncircumstance, his departure from the scene may be evidence of consciousness of guilt. See, e.g., \nUnited States v. Schepp, 746 F.2d 406, 409-410 (8th Cir. 1984) (\u201cIt is well settled that flight of the \naccused subsequent to the commission of a crime is, in certain instances, a circumstance proper to \nbe laid before a jury as having a tendency to prove guilt.\u201d).3 Finally, this is not the first time \nApplicant was charged with domestic violence. In 2012, he was arrested and charged with Assault \nand Battery-Family for an alleged assault on his then-wife. In his background interview, Applicant \nclaimed that his ex-wife instigated that incident when she started screaming at him, pushed the \ntelevision over while he was playing video games, and was trying to fight with him when he \nknocked a cup out of her hand. GE 2 at 16. In essence, Applicant has been charged with assaulting \ntwo different domestic partners and, in both instances, he essentially claimed it was his domestic \npartner\u2019s fault. The police report regarding the 2020 Assault and Battery-Family charge was \nsufficient substantial evidence to establish that Applicant committed this offense. The Judge erred \nin concluding otherwise. \nConclusion \nApplicant has a recent history of alcohol-related and criminal conduct charges. From 2012 \nto 2020, he had three DWI arrests, three drunk in public arrests, an ignition interlock violation, \ntwo domestic violence arrests, and two violating protective order arrests. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n13-00596 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Jun. 26, 2015) (multiple nature of criminal charges is a reason to doubt \nan applicant\u2019s claims of innocent behavior). In 2022, a psychologist diagnosed Applicant with \nalcohol use disorder, moderate, and concluded that he could not provide a favorable clearance \nrecommendation because Applicant\u2019s condition \u201cinherently presents a threat to his judgment and \nreliability.\u201d GE 7 at 5. As discussed above, the Judge erred in failing to examine relevant evidence, \nwhich resulted in him discounting the psychologist\u2019s evaluation as well as Applicant\u2019s 2019 DWI \narrest and 2020 domestic violence arrest when conducting a recency analysis under Guidelines G \nand J. \nFrom our review of the record, there was insufficient evidence for the Judge to conclude \nthat \u201cApplicant has mitigated the security concerns raised by his alcohol consumption and criminal \nconduct.\u201d Decision at 10. The Judge\u2019s decision runs contrary to the weight of the record evidence, \nand was therefore arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law. The record, viewed as a whole, is not \nsufficient to mitigate the Government\u2019s security concerns under Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cThe standard applicable in security clearance decisions is that a \nclearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national \nsecurity.\u2019\u201d). Therefore, the decision is not sustainable. \n3 Of note, Applicant was charged with fleeing from police during a drunk in public arrest in 2019. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOrder \nThe decision is REVERSED. \nSigned: James F.

Applicant did not submit a response to the FORM. On January 31, 2023, after \nconsidering the record, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge \nCharles C. Hale denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. Applicant appealed pursuant \nto Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nThe SOR alleged eight financial concerns totaling approximately $378,000, including six \nconsumer, utility, and medical debts that were placed for collection or charged off, and two past-\ndue mortgage accounts.

In 2012, he began his current job as a Defense contractor and \nfound he had significantly less time to spend on the LLC. Then, in 2014, Applicant asserts that a \nlender\u2019s erroneous action resulted in the LLC being unable to secure financing to buy new \nproperties and make necessary repairs to others. As a result, the LLC dissolved in 2017. Decision \nat 3. The Judge found that Applicant\u2019s debts are recent, numerous, and ongoing, and that he failed \nto demonstrate responsible action regarding the debts or that he is pursuing a course of action that \nhas a reasonable chance of successfully resolving them. Decision at 6. \nOn appeal, Applicant argues that the Judge erred because the record contained no evidence \nthat Applicant has ever been alleged to be negligent in safeguarding classified information, or that \nhe has \u201cever demonstrated poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by the \nrules and regulations\u201d while employed by his security clearance sponsor. Appeal Brief at 1. \nSecurity clearance adjudications are predictive in nature, and it is foreseeable that individuals with \nprior good records may nevertheless engage in conduct or undergo circumstances that raise doubts \nabout their future judgment or reliability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-04927 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. \n4, 2005) (citing Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528-529 (1988)). The Government \nneed not wait until an individual mishandles classified information before it can make an \nunfavorable security clearance decision. Id. (citing Adams v. Laird, 420 F.2d 230, 238-239 (D.C. \nCir. 1969), cert. denied, 397 U.S. 1039 (1970)). Rather, an unfavorable clearance decision can be \nbased on circumstances that raise security concerns sufficient to preclude a determination that it is \nclearly consistently with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for a given \napplicant, and a history of financial problems is a circumstance that raises such concerns. See, e.g., \nISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004) (citing Egan, 484 U.S. at 528-529). \nThe remainder of Applicant\u2019s appeal amounts to a disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing \nof the evidence. For example, Applicant argues that the Judge erred in finding that the debts are \nrecent and ongoing, citing one lender\u2019s litigation timeline for prolonging Applicant\u2019s resolution of \nthe debt. Appeal Brief at 1-2. These arguments, however, are not sufficient to demonstrate that the \nJudge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or \ncontrary to law. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007). \nApplicant has not established that the Judge committed harmful error. The Judge examined \nthe relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision, and the record \nevidence is more than sufficient to support that the Judge\u2019s findings and conclusions are \nsustainable. \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent \nwith the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 528. \u201cAny doubt concerning \npersonnel being considered for national security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6 2(b). \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOrder \nThe decision is AFFIRMED. \nSigned: James F.

Although he consumed \nalcohol prior to 2018, in that year he became stressed due to his impending retirement and the need \nto find post-military employment. He began drinking heavily, and by early 2019 he was \nconsuming a bottle of wine a night and two bottles each weekend night. His drinking began to \naffect his family, and, upon the advice of a physician, he voluntarily entered into a private-sector \ntreatment program in February 2019, which diagnosed him as suffering from Alcohol Use Disorder \n(Severe).  \nAt the time of his discharge from the outpatient program in April 2019, Applicant reported \nthat he was experiencing tremors and cravings for alcohol. In the initial stages of the program, \nApplicant had been prescribed a drug to reduce these cravings. His discharge documents state that \nhe was encouraged to continue in an aftercare program, to abstain from alcohol, and to maintain \nattendance at a recovery group such as AA. Applicant\u2019s prognosis was characterized as \u201cFair.\u201d \nDecision at 3. Applicant discontinued aftercare in early 2020, by which point he was no longer \nabstaining from drinking. Additionally, he never filled the prescription for the drug that would \nreduce his cravings for alcohol. Applicant claimed that he continued with AA for a period, had \ncompleted the 12 steps, and had a sponsor.  \nApplicant testified that he now consumes alcohol only at social events, limiting himself to \nno more than three drinks. He has promised his family never to return to his old drinking habits. \nThe drug and alcohol program advisor (DAPA) for Applicant\u2019s former command submitted a \ncharacter reference. This official stated that he saw no reason to be concerned that Applicant\u2019s \ndrinking habits would affect his job performance. His current supervisor lauded his duty \nperformance. The record contains no evidence of a professional opinion regarding Applicant\u2019s \nuse of alcohol. \nIn the Analysis portion of the Decision, the Judge concluded that too little time had passed \nsince his security-significant conduct to conclude that Applicant has shown rehabilitation. The \nJudge cited to evidence that Applicant continues to consume alcohol despite a recommendation \nthat he abstain, that he is not currently participating in programs such as AA, and that Applicant \nhad not provided a professional opinion as to the current applicability of the diagnosis and opinions \ncontained in the record. He also stated that there is no evidence other than Applicant\u2019s own \ntestimony regarding his current levels of alcohol consumption. The Judge concluded that \nApplicant had not met his burden of persuasion as to mitigation. \nDiscussion \nApplicant contends that the Judge made errors in his findings of fact. For example, he \nstates that at the time he was discharged from the alcohol treatment program he was no longer \nsuffering from tremors. Government Exhibit 4, Discharge Summary at 2, appears to state that \ntremors were symptomatic at the time Applicant entered the program, making no reference to such \na condition at the time of discharge. This finding is erroneous. Applicant also contends that the \nJudge erred in finding that a letter was submitted from a DAPA official at a former command. The \nrecord does not support that finding. The letter states, \u201c[Applicant] worked directly for me for the \nduration of my time here at [the organization] from June 2019 to current date.\u201d Applicant Exhibit \nC at 1.

The Judge\u2019s material findings of security \nconcern are supported by substantial evidence.  See ISCR Case No. 18-01564 at 3 (App. Bd. May \n30, 2019). \nApplicant\u2019s brief consists in large measure of a challenge the Judge\u2019s weighing of the \nevidence. However, a disagreement with the weight the Judge assigned to the record evidence is \nnot sufficient to show that the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, \ncapricious, or contrary to law. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 18-02872 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 15, 2020). \nThe Judge\u2019s findings and the record evidence underlying those findings show that Applicant was \ndiagnosed with Alcohol Use Disorder (Severe), with symptoms including tremors; that treatment \nproviders recommended that Applicant abstain from consuming alcohol; that despite this \nrecommendation Applicant continues to consume alcohol; and that there is no corroborating \nevidence supporting his testimony about his current levels of consumption. It is reasonable for a \nJudge to expect an applicant to corroborate his claims regarding efforts at mitigation. See, e.g., \nISCR Case No. 17-01193 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan 22, 2019).

The Judge concluded that \nApplicant failed to address his student loans responsibly because, although his plan to resolve the \nloans by refinancing his mortgage was not unreasonable, it \u201ccomes too late to show responsible \naction.\u201d Id. at 5-6. \nOn appeal, Applicant first contends that, despite having answered the SOR in May 2022, \nhe did not know what the case was about or else he would have acted on his loans. The SOR: 1) \ninformed Applicant that DoD was unable to find that it was clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant him access to classified information based on concerns under Guideline F of the \nDirective; 2) provided the overarching concern raised under Guideline F;1 and 3) specifically \nalleged that Applicant was indebted to the Department of Education for two student loans, each \nidentified by account number and approximate outstanding balance, that were placed for collection \nand remained delinquent as of the date of the SOR. Applicant admitted both allegations in his May \n23, 2022, response to the SOR. An applicant is entitled to receive reasonable notice of the \nallegations being made against him so that he can have a meaningful opportunity to respond \nthereto. See ISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004). The concern set forth in the \nSOR and the specificity of the two allegations sufficiently placed Applicant on notice that his \ndelinquent student loans formed the basis for the Government\u2019s concerns in this matter. We find \nno error based on Applicant\u2019s first argument. \nApplicant also challenges the Judge\u2019s findings that Applicant was unable to satisfy his \ndebts and has a history of not meeting financial obligations, arguing that his student loans are the \nonly obligation that have been delinquent. Applicant testified that his student loan delinquencies \nwere initially the result of inconsistent employment, and he has never been on a repayment plan \nfor the loans. Tr. at 28-29, 37-38. He further testified that he procrastinated and took no action to \naddress the debts until several weeks prior to his security clearance hearing. Tr. at 38-42. Contrary \nto Applicant\u2019s contention, the Judge\u2019s application of disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and \n19(c) was reasonable and based on record evidence. \nFinally, Applicant submits new evidence in the form of a documentary update on the status \nof his student loans. The Appeal Board does not review cases de novo and is prohibited from \nconsidering new evidence on appeal. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29. \nApplicant has not established that the Judge committed harmful error. Our review of the \nrecord reflects that the Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory \nexplanation for the decision, which is sustainable on this record. \u201cThe general standard is that a \nclearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d \nDepartment of the Navy v.

The Judge \nfound in favor of Applicant on the CBD allegation and against him on the other allegations. \nOn appeal, Applicant raises procedural due process challenges pertaining to his right to be \nrepresented by counsel and his failure to object to a motion to amend the SOR. He also includes \nnew evidence with his appeal and argues why he should be granted security eligibility. These \narguments are without merit. \nFirst, Applicant contends he attempted to contact an attorney or personal representative to \nassist him at his hearing but was unable to find someone in time and he did not know how to ask \nfor a continuance so that he could engage an attorney. He said he \u201cdid [his] best to handle [his] \nhearing but obviously failed,\u201d and had he been able to present his case \u201ccompletely and with proper \nprocedure, it would prove that [he was] an asset and not a liability.\u201d Appeal Brief at 1. He also \nbelieves that had he presented additional evidence that he included in his appeal, he would have \nprevailed. Id. Applicant does not dispute the Judge\u2019s findings or conclusions and praises the Judge \nand DC\u2019s respectful attitude and help they gave him during the hearing.1 Appeal Brief at 2. Rather, \nhe argues that had he been represented or was better able to present facts and argue his case, he \nwould have had a favorable outcome. \nThe Appeal Board does not review cases de novo and is prohibited from considering new \nevidence on appeal. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29. In general, Applicant\u2019s substantive arguments regarding \nthe unfavorable decision amount to a disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, \nwhich is not sufficient to demonstrate that she weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a \nmanner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007). \nApplicant\u2019s procedural due process challenges are neither persuasive nor supported by \nrecord evidence. Regarding these claims, it should be noted that, while pro se applicants cannot \nbe expected to act like lawyers, they are expected to take timely, reasonable steps to protect their \nrights under the Directive. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-02196 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Apr. 27, 2018). \nFurthermore, having decided to represent themselves during the proceedings below, pro se \napplicants cannot fairly complain about the quality of their self-representation or seek to be \nrelieved of the consequences of their decision to represent themselves. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n11-08118 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Aug. 12, 2013). \nApplicant\u2019s claim that he did not understand hearing procedures was not the result of any \nfailure on the part of the Government or the Judge. Rather, Applicant was provided adequate \ninformation about hearing procedures. First, when he received the SOR, Applicant was provided \na copy of the Directive, which sets forth detailed procedural rules for conducting hearings, \nincluding an applicant\u2019s right to be represented by counsel or a personal representative and the \nstandard for granting continuance requests. Directive \u00b6\u00b6 4.3 and E3.1.8. In September 2022, \nDepartment Counsel sent Applicant a letter that contained the DC\u2019s contact information, advised \n1 \u201cThe judge and defense attorney were respectful and helped me to the limit of their ability.\u201d \u201cJudge Ricciardello was \nrespectful and as helpful as she was allowed to be.\u201d Appeal Brief at 2. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhim to contact DC with any questions, and again informed him of his representational rights at the \nhearing. When he received the notice of hearing, Applicant was also provided the Chief \nAdministrative Judge\u2019s prehearing guidance. This guidance advised that the hearing was an \nadversarial proceeding, the Government would be represented by counsel, his right to counsel or \na non-lawyer representative, how to request a postponement of a scheduled hearing, and other \ninformation about hearing procedures, including the right to present and object to evidence. \nDuring the hearing, Applicant acknowledged receiving the Chief Judge\u2019s letter and \nindicated that he intended to represent himself. Tr. at 5. The Judge painstakingly explained the \nhearing procedures with Applicant, instructed him on objections, requesting clarifications or \naddressing questions, and made substantial efforts to ensure his testimony was clear and complete. \nSee, e.g., Tr. at 6-15. During the hearing, Applicant did not request an opportunity to retain counsel \nor request additional time to find someone to represent him or prepare his case. He knew how to \ncontact DC as he testified that he had sent him evidence. Tr. at 14. He noted his past mistakes in \nhis opening statement, and said, \u201c\u2026obviously, I\u2019ve had plenty of time to think about it and also \ntime to speak with my \u2013 with counsel [providing representation in other matters], and I\u2019ve \nsubmitted those documents of all my evaluations, all my mental evaluations, and continuing \u2013 \ncontinue speaking with the counsel, and also the drug test that I sent in since all that took place \nshould prove that there are not issues with illegal drug use, and it was a bad mistake one time, and \nit hasn\u2019t happened again.\u201d Id. At one point while trying to explain his past court proceedings to \nthe Judge, he noted he \u201cdid try to . . . retain counsel, but . . .\u201d before being cut off with the Judge\u2019s \nattempt to clarify her question. Tr. at 22. However, at no time did Applicant explain that he wanted \ncounsel or a personal representative or request a continuance in order to obtain representation. \nBased on our review of the record, we conclude that Applicant was fully apprised of the \nadversarial nature of the hearing, his right to counsel, and his other rights. Applicant voluntarily \ndecided to represent himself. We find no reason to conclude that Applicant was deprived of the \nrights afforded him by the Directive to a fair hearing and due process. Applicant received sufficient \nnotice to apprise a reasonable person of his right to counsel. The record provides no reason to \nconclude that Applicant\u2019s decision to represent himself was other than knowing and intelligent. \nISCR Case No. 12-08972 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 25, 2016). Moreover, there was no reason for the \nJudge to conclude that Applicant was incompetent or unable to represent himself. \nApplicant further argues that he did not understand his right to object to DC\u2019s motion to \namend the SOR to add language to the two Guideline H allegations to allege use of drugs while \nholding a \u201csensitive position\u201d so as to invoke AG \u00b6 25(f).2 Tr. at 100-103. In his appeal, Applicant \nsaid \u201cI had no idea that I could object to this motion or even what I was objecting about.\u201d Appeal \nBrief at 2. The hearing transcript shows a different story. Department Counsel explained the \nmotion, and the Judge summarized it for Applicant and explained his right to object. Applicant \nthen appropriately objected to the amendments; however, the Judge overruled the objection. \nThe Judge explained the Applicant\u2019s right to object to testimony or documents during the \nhearing, the relaxed rules of evidence, and Applicant\u2019s obligation to \u201cspeak up\u201d if he did not \nunderstand something during the proceeding.

Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. For reasons stated \nbelow, we affirm the Judge\u2019s decision. \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant had 27 delinquent debts totaling about $45,000. In \nresponding to the SOR, Applicant admitted all but one of the allegations.

The Judge noted that \nhe marked the post-hearing exhibits and entered them into the record. The Judge\u2019s error regarding \nthe timeliness of the post-hearing submission was harmless because it did not likely affect the \noutcome of the case.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nChristopher Snowden, Esq. \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nMay 20, 2022, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that \ndecision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline I (Psychological Conditions) of the National \nSecurity Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) of Security Executive Agent Directive 4 (effective June 8, \n2017) and DoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). Applicant requested a \nhearing. On May 4, 2023, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals Administrative Judge Wilford \nH. Ross denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. Applicant appealed pursuant to \nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nThe SOR alleged concerns stemming from Applicant\u2019s arrest and hospitalization in early \n2020 and her mental health evaluation conducted in late 2021, both of which are addressed in more \ndetail below. The Judge found against Applicant on all concerns. On appeal, Applicant asserts that \nthe Judge failed to properly consider all available evidence, rendering his adverse decision \narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law, and failed to properly apply the mitigating conditions and \nwhole-person analysis. For the following reasons, we affirm. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nJudge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis \nApplicant is in her early 60s and holds both bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees. She has been \nemployed in the defense industry since the late 1980s and has held a security clearance since the \nlate 1990s. \nApplicant has been engaged in mental health treatment for at least 30 years, since she was \nin college, which consisted of both medication management and therapy. The record contained \nlimited information regarding the extent of Applicant\u2019s treatment before 2020.1 \nIn January 2020, Applicant was arrested and involuntarily hospitalized because she was \n\u201cknocking on random peoples\u2019 doors attempting to gain entry,\u201d and was \u201cthreatening to \u2018stomp\u2019 \nthe wife of an ex-boyfriend of hers from 40 years before and teach that person a lesson.\u201d Decision \nat 3. At the end of the two-week hospitalization, during which she was diagnosed with \nSchizoaffective Disorder, Bipolar Type, Applicant was discharged in fair condition. She testified \nthat she had little to no memory of the incident leading to the hospitalization, that it was a \u201cone\u00ad\ntime thing,\u201d and that nothing like it had occurred before or after the incident. Id. at 3, 5. \nFollowing her discharge, Applicant began seeing a psychiatric nurse practitioner (the \n\u201cPNP\u201d) on about a monthly basis for medication management and therapy. In a statement \nsubmitted prior to the hearing, the PNP expressed that Applicant has maintained psychiatric \nstability on the current medication regiment and provided a working diagnosis of Post-Traumatic \nStress Disorder. In a supplemental statement, the PNP expressed that Applicant\u2019s psychiatric \nsymptoms have remained well controlled and in remission. Based on Applicant\u2019s progress over \nthe prior two and a half years, the PNP did not believe that Applicant would experience a relapse \nof symptoms if she maintained medication and mental health treatment compliance. \nIn November 2021, Applicant was evaluated by a DoD mental health consultant (the \n\u201cMHC\u201d) and again diagnosed with Schizoaffective Disorder. The MHC concluded that Applicant \npresents with \u201ca significant mental health history with active indications of delusional ideation and \ndisorganization in thinking,\u201d and that \u201cthere are considerable concerns about her judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness at this time, as well as her long-term prognosis.\u201d Decision at 4 \n(quoting Government Exhibit (GE) 2 at 10). \nThe Judge found that Applicant has suffered from severe and chronic mental health issues \nfor decades, that the MHC found that Applicant has a condition that may impair her judgment, \nstability, reliability, and trustworthiness, and that Applicant was involuntarily hospitalized after \nengaging in violent and bizarre behavior. He concluded that disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 28(a), \n(b), and (c) applied. The Judge concurred with the MHC\u2019s concern about Applicant\u2019s \u201capparent \ninability to rationally discuss her situation and treatment in depth,\u201d noting that the majority of her \nresponses at hearing were monosyllabic and she was unable to answer specific questions about \nproviders predating the PNP. Decision at 8. Moreover, the PNP\u2019s statement that Applicant\u2019s \nsymptoms are well controlled by medication was conclusory and insufficient in light of the lack \n1 Notably, although she testified at hearing that she has engaged in mental health treatment for over 30 years, Applicant \ndisclosed no mental health counseling in the preceding seven years in her 2016 security clearance application.

In weighing the evidence \npresented by the mental health professionals, the Judge found that the PNP\u2019s favorable statements \nwere insufficient to overcome the MHC\u2019s conclusions, which were supported by an \u201cextensive \nreport that discussed several issues concerning Applicant\u2019s mental health.\u201d Decision at 9. \nDiscussion \nOn appeal, Applicant contends that the Judge erred in failing to comply with the provisions \nin Executive Order 10865 and the Directive by not considering all the evidence, by applying facts \nthat were not supported by the record evidence, and by not properly applying the mitigating \nconditions and Whole-Person Concept. \nChallenge to Findings of Fact \nApplicant first asserts that several of the Judge\u2019s factual findings are \u201cunsupported by the \nrecord.\u201d Appeal Brief at 8. There is a difference between errors in a judge\u2019s findings of fact and \nerrors in the conclusions drawn therefrom. Applicant\u2019s purported factual errors are more accurately \nchallenges to the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence and are therefore addressed along with her \nother arguments. \nChallenge to Diagnosis \nApplicant next argues that the record is insufficient to support her diagnosis of \nSchizoaffective Disorder because: 1) the 2020 diagnosis was based on a deficient and flawed \nmethodology; and 2) the 2021 diagnosis relied \u201cexclusively\u201d on the allegedly defective 2020 \ndiagnosis. Appeal Brief at 9, 10. Neither of these arguments has merit. \nApplicant\u2019s original diagnosis resulted during an involuntary hospitalization in 2020 after \npolice found her \u201cknocking on a random person\u2019s door and saying that she wanted to \u2018stomp\u2019 his \nwife.\u201d GE 3 at 1. During her admission, Applicant made strange statements and was observed to \nbe \u201chyperverbal, quite disorganized with labile mood, laughing inappropriately, [and] continued \nto make threatening remarks to others.\u201d Id. It was noted that Applicant had poor insight and \njudgment and was confused and uncooperative. Id. at 2. Contrary to Applicant\u2019s assertion on \nappeal, her differential diagnosis at admission included Bipolar Affective Disorder with Psychosis \nor Schizoaffective Disorder, while the provider explored ruling the latter out. Id. During her two-\nweek treatment, Applicant underwent physical and neurological examinations, engaged in \nindividual and group counseling, and began psychotropic medications. Id. at 3-4, 5. Upon her \ndischarge, Applicant\u2019s diagnosis of Schizoaffective Disorder, Bipolar Type was formalized. Id. at \n5. Applicant has provided no authority, either at hearing or on appeal, for why this methodology \nwas flawed, why the diagnosis was erroneous, or why the Judge should have discounted either. \nThe 2021 diagnosis followed an evaluation conducted by a licensed clinical psychologist, \nwhich considered Applicant\u2019s 2020 treatment records, a personality assessment, and a clinical \ninterview. GE 2 at 8, 9. The personality assessment revealed \u201clongstanding patterns of instability \nin mood, distortions in perception, and interpersonal issues for [Applicant].\u201d Id. at 10. Applicant \nreported a long history of outpatient psychotherapy but could not provide details about providers \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \nor estimated dates of treatment. Id. at 6. The MHC affirmed Applicant\u2019s Schizoaffective Disorder \nand concluded that \u201cthere are considerable concerns about her judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness at this time, as well as her long-term prognosis.\u201d Id. at 10. \nApplicant contends that, despite the foregoing evidence, \u201cthe record does not have an \nindependent basis for the diagnosis of Schizoaffective Disorder.\u201d Appeal Brief at 10. She attempts \nto create a requirement on the Government to present evidence underlying a diagnosis, such as the \ncriteria set forth in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, in addition to \nevidence of the diagnosis itself. No such requirement exists. Applicant\u2019s diagnoses were \nestablished by medical records, which were admitted into evidence without objection. See Tr. at \n10. She had the opportunity to challenge the sufficiency of those records and diagnoses at hearing; \nhowever, aside from addressing the limited time spent with her during the 2021 evaluation \ninterview (Tr. at 27-28), she made no such challenge. \nMoreover, Applicant\u2019s emphasis on the diagnosis is somewhat misplaced as the Guideline \nI concern specifically states that a \u201cformal diagnosis of a disorder is not required for there to be a \nconcern under this guideline.\u201d See AG \u00b6 27. Although the Judge identified the diagnoses in his \nfactual findings, his Guideline I analysis does not address the diagnosis at all. Rather, the Judge \nfocused on the duration and severity of Applicant\u2019s mental health issues, including the \ncircumstances surrounding her 2020 hospitalization, her inability to provide details about her \nlengthy treatment history, and the concerns set forth by the MHC about Applicant\u2019s current mental \nhealth status and prognosis. We find no error in the Judge\u2019s analysis. \nChallenge to Weighing of Evidence and Application of Mitigating Conditions \nAs an initial matter, Applicant asserts that the Judge found that all five Guideline I \nmitigating factors were potentially applicable and therefore erred by not providing a specific \nanalysis of each factor. Appeal Brief at 10. This misrepresents the language in the Judge\u2019s decision, \nwhich simply acknowledges that the Guideline I concern contains five potential mitigating \nconditions. Decision at 8. Moreover, a judge need not discuss all the potentially applicable \nanalytical factors set forth in the Directive, including the mitigating conditions. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 12-05512 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2017) (citation omitted). \nThe crux of Applicant\u2019s remaining appeal argument is that the Judge failed to duly consider \nand give adequate weight to her favorable evidence, namely the PNP\u2019s two statements, and \nconsequently committed harmful error by not applying mitigating conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 29(a) and \n29(b). Appeal Brief at 11-12. \nThe Judge found that the Government presented substantial evidence via Applicant\u2019s \nhospitalization records and the MHC evaluation to establish the SOR concerns. Decision at 8. It \nwas then Applicant\u2019s responsibility to present evidence in rebuttal, explanation, extenuation, or \nmitigation sufficient to overcome the case against her. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. Her evidence \naddressing the Guideline I concern consisted of two single-page statements from the PNP dated \nabout one week before and one week after the hearing.

A judge is compelled neither to accept a DoD mental health consultant\u2019s diagnosis, \nnor to reject it simply because conflicting evidence exists in the record. Rather, he must consider \nthe record evidence as a whole in deciding what weight to give the conflicting opinions. See, e.g., \nISCR Case No. 99-0288 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 18, 2000). \nIn discussing the potential mitigating conditions, the Judge acknowledged the PNP\u2019s \nstatements and her representation that Applicant\u2019s symptoms are well controlled with medication. \nDecision at 9. Conversely, he found that the \u201cMHC wrote an extensive report that discussed several \nissues concerning Applicant\u2019s mental health, in particular her history of disorganized thinking and \ndistortions in perception.\u201d Id. The Judge weighed the foregoing evidence and found the former to \nbe conclusory and, without more, insufficient to overcome the more robust information and \nanalysis presented by the MHC. Id. Given the totality of the record, the Judge\u2019s acceptance of the \nMHC\u2019s diagnosis and prognosis is sustainable. \nApplicant\u2019s arguments on appeal amount to a disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of \nthe evidence, which is not sufficient to show that the Judge weighed the psychological evaluation \nor any other record evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. See, \ne.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007). The Judge examined the relevant \nevidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision, and the record evidence is \nsufficient to support that the Judge\u2019s findings and conclusions are sustainable. \u201cThe general \nstandard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the \nnational security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v.

With minor modifications, the Judge found against \nApplicant on five of those allegations, i.e., that Applicant had a Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharged \nin 2021; that he owed over $21,000 in past due Federal income taxes for 2016-2018; and that he \nfailed to file his Federal income tax returns for 2019-2020 in a timely manner.
