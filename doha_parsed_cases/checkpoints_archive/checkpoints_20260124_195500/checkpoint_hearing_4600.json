On April 2, 2024, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was scheduled to be \nconducted by video teleconference on April 22, 2024. The administrative judge convened \nthe hearing as scheduled. The administrative judge continued the hearing because it \nappeared that Applicant had not received the government exhibits. The transcript of this \nabbreviated session was received on May 2, 2024, and it is attached to the record as \nHearing Exhibit I. \nThe case was reassigned to me on May 2, 2024. On May 17, 2024, DOHA notified \nApplicant that the case was scheduled to be conducted by video teleconference on June \n6, 2024. Applicant indicated that he wanted an in-person hearing, and the hearing notice \nwas amended on June 3, 2024, to provide for an in-person hearing on the same date and \nat the same time. I convened the hearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 \nthrough 12 were admitted in evidence without objection. Department Counsel requested \nthat I take administrative notice of a fact sheet pertaining to the timeline for detectability \nof tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) metabolites. (GX 13) Applicant did not object, and I took \nadministrative notice as requested. Applicant testified, presented the testimony of one \nwitness, and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through F, which were admitted \nwithout objection. I kept the record open until June 6, 2024, to enable Applicant to submit \nadditional evidence. He submitted AX G through K, which were admitted without \nobjection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on June 20, 2024. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 2.b-\n2.f, 2.h-2.l, and 2.n, with explanations. He denied the allegations n SOR \u00b6 1.a, 1.c. 2.g, \nand 2.m. He did not admit or deny SOR \u00b6 2.a. His admissions are incorporated in my \nfindings of fact.  \nApplicant is a 38-year-old armed security officer employed by a federal contractor \nsince April 2022. He has a long and checkered employment history. His first employment \nas federal contactor employee was as a mail clerk from May 2009 to March 2010. He was \nemployed by a state government as a passport specialist from July 2010 to May 2011, \nwhen he left because of illness. He was employed as an armed security officer from \nFebruary 2009 to October 2013, when his contract ended.1 He was employed by a federal \ncontractor as a research analysist from April 2014 to February 2015, when his \nemployment ended because the processing of his application for the required clearance \nwas not completed. He was unemployed from February to November 2015. He voluntarily \nleft two jobs between February 2017 and September 2018, looking for better jobs. He \nworked for a state contractor as an administrative support technician from September \n1  This period employment overlaps his employment as a mail clerk from May 2009  to March 2020 and as \na passport specialist from July 2020 to May 2011.

He worked for a federal contractor in an access control position from \nDecember 2020 to March 2021, when he left by mutual agreement after a coworker \nreported that she was afraid to work with him. He worked for a non-government employer \nas an information technology technician from November to December 2021, when he was \nfired. In his e-QIP, he stated that he was fired for no reason. (GX 1 at 13). He began \nworking for his current employer as an armed security officer in April 2022. \nApplicant graduated from high school in June 2004. He attended college from May \n2004 to December 2005, June to August 2015, and March and April 2018, but he has not \nreceived a degree. \nIn connection with Applicant\u2019s employment by federal contractors, he submitted e-\nQIPs in January 2009 (GX 4), April 2014 (GX 3), September 2018 (GX 2), and April 2022 \n(GX 1) He received his first security clearance in 2009. (GX 5 at 29) \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges that Applicant used marijuana on various occasions \u201cat least \napproximately May 2017 and November 2020.\u201d Applicant denied this allegation in his \nanswer to the SOR, admitting that he used marijuana in June 2017 and asserting that he \nhas not used or possessed any illegal substance since that date. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleges that Applicant was charged with possession of marijuana in \napproximately June 2017. He admitted this allegation, explaining that he possessed a \ncigar containing marijuana. He received deferred disposition and was placed on \nsupervised probation for 12 months. He completed the period of supervised probation, \nduring which he was subjected to random drug testing on five occasions, and the charges \nwere dismissed. (Tr. 20-21; GX 8 at 6) When Applicant was interviewed by a security \ninvestigator in January 2019, he told the investigator that he used marijuana for relaxation \nand that he had used it once a day for about 30 days in April 2017. (GX 5 at 21) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c alleges that in November 2020, Applicant failed a urinalysis test by \ntesting positive for marijuana. He denied this allegation, asserting that his supervisor told \nhim that the urinalysis test results were inconclusive. However, the laboratory report \nreflects that the results were positive for marijuana metabolites, and the letter of \ntermination from his employer states that the results were positive. (GX 6; AX H at 2) \nApplicant obtained another urinalysis test at his own expense in December 2020, which \ntested negative for marijuana. (AX K) I have taken administrative notice that a single use \nof marijuana can be detected by marijuana use for up to three days, heavy daily marijuana \nuse can be detected by urinalysis for up to ten days, and chronic heavy use can be \ndetected for up to 30 days. Because there is no evidence that Applicant was a heavy user \nof marijuana in November 2020, his negative test results in December 2020 do not refute \nthe positive results in November 2020. Applicant testified that he resigned from his job \nbecause of the urinalysis results, but he was rehired by the same employer a year later. \n(Tr. 24) \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.a cross-alleges the conduct in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c.

He partially admitted this allegation in his \nanswer to the SOR. He admitted that he had an argument with his cohabitant about \nunpaid bills, and that he destroyed some of her clothing in a closet. (AX A) At the hearing, \nhe denied that he assaulted his cohabitant, but he admitted that he destroyed some \nclothing that he had purchased for her by pouring bleach on it. (Tr. 26, 86) The charges \nwere nolle prosequi. (GX 8 at 4). \nSOR \u00b6 2.c alleges that Applicant was charged with assault on a family member in \nJanuary 2011. He admitted this allegation but denied putting his hands on the alleged \nvictim, with whom he was living at the time. At the hearing, he testified that he had an \nargument with her because she caught him talking on the phone with another woman he \nwas dating. (Tr. 27) The charges were nolle prosequi. (GX 8 at 4) \nSOR \u00b6 2.d alleges that Applicant falsified his April 2014 e-QIP by deliberately \nfailing to disclose that he was terminated from a job as a mail clerk on a military installation \nfor giving mail to an unauthorized person. In his e-QIP, he stated that he left this job \nbecause the contract ended. (GX 3 at 16) He gave the same explanation in his 2018 e-\nQIP and 2022 E-QIP. (GX 1 at 29; GX 2 at 23) In his answer to the SOR, he admitted \nbeing terminated for not delivering the mail as required. (AX A) At the hearing, he testified \nthat he did not deliver the mail because he was informed that someone was coming to \nget the incoming mail and deliver it. He testified that he was later invited to return to the \nsame job but did not accept the offer because he had accepted another job. (Tr. 28-29) \nSOR \u00b6 2.e alleges that Applicant falsified his April 2014 e-QIP by deliberately \nfailing to disclose that he was charged with assault on a family member and destruction \nof property in June 2008. In his answer to the SOR, he stated that he thought being \n\u201ccharged\u201d meant being convicted. At the hearing, he testified that he did not disclose the \ncharges because he was not convicted. (Tr. 29) \nSOR \u00b6 2.f alleges that in October 2014, Applicant was charged with felony \nabduction by force, obstruction of communication through wireless means to prevent help, \nand assault on a family member. At the hearing, he admitted that he was charged but \ndenied the basis for the charge. He stated that he and a girlfriend had an angry argument \nwhen another girlfriend called him on his cellphone.

In his answer to the SOR, he admitted this allegation, \nstating that he did not read his answer carefully. \nSOR \u00b6 2.i alleges that Applicant falsified his September 2018 e-QIP by failing to \ndisclose the conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 2.f, and 1.g, all of which occurred within the \nlast seven years before the date of the e-QIP. In his answer to the SOR and at the hearing, \nhe admitted the allegation but explained that he thought more than seven years had \nelapsed and that he had forgotten about the marijuana charge. \nSOR \u00b6 2.j alleges that Applicant falsified his September 2018 e-QIP by failing to \ndisclose his use of marijuana in May or June 2017.

During cross-\nexamination at the hearing, he repeated his assertion that he had forgotten about the \nmarijuana charge.

He was fired without an opportunity to explain himself. At \nthe hearing, he admitted that the fellow employee told him that she was scared to work \nwith him and accused him of being lazy. (Tr. 37-39) \nSOR \u00b6 2.l alleges that Applicant falsified his April 2022 e-QIP by admitting his \nmarijuana use in May 2017 but not disclosing his marijuana use in November 2020. In his \nanswer to the SOR, he stated that he did not use marijuana in November 2020. At the \nhearing, he denied that he used marijuana in November 2020, notwithstanding the \npositive urinalysis results.

The summary of an earlier security \ninterview in January 2019 reflects that Applicant volunteered the information about his \nmarijuana use and stated that he used it one time per day for about thirty days. (GX 5 at \n21) At the hearing, he denied telling the investigator that he used marijuana 30 times. (Tr. \n42-44) However, when he responded to DOHA interrogatories in March 2023 and was \nasked to authenticate the record of his security January 2019 interview, he pointed out \nsome errors within the summary but did not challenge the accuracy of the part of the \nsummary reflecting his admission that he used it once a day for about 30 days in May \n2017.

An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan at 531. Substantial \nevidence is \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to \nsupport a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d See ISCR \nCase No. 17-04166 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 21, 2019) It is \u201cless than the weight of the \nevidence, and the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence \ndoes not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d \nConsolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966). \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d \nis \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area \nTransit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a nexus or \nrational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed therein and \nan applicant\u2019s security suitability. ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan at 531.  \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b, alleging possession of marijuana in June 2017, duplicates the \nallegation in SOR \u00b6 1.a, alleging use of marijuana between May 2017 and November \n2020. When the same conduct is alleged twice in the SOR under the same guideline, one \nof the duplicative allegations should be resolved in Applicant's favor. See ISCR Case No. \n03-04704 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2005). Accordingly, I have resolved SOR \u00b6 1.b for \nApplicant. \nThe following disqualifying conditions under this guideline are potentially \napplicable: \nAG \u00b6 25(a): any substance misuse (see above definition); \nAG \u00b6 25(b): testing positive for an illegal drug;  \nAG \u00b6 25(c): illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug \nparaphernalia; and. \nAG \u00b6 25(f): any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nApplicant admitted that he used marijuana in June 2017. He denied using it in \nNovember 2020, even though he tested positive after undergoing urinalysis testing. His \nadmission and the evidence submitted at the hearing are sufficient to establish AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n25(a), 25(b), and 25(c). \nApplicant\u2019s drug use in June 2017 occurred after he received a security clearance. \nHowever, there is no evidence that he had actual access to classified information. To the \ncontrary, he was terminated from a position as a research analyst for a federal agency \nbecause he lacked required clearance. However, the record reflects that he testified \npositive for marijuana use in November 2020 while he was an armed security officer, \nwhich was a sensitive position. Nevertheless, Applicant\u2019s drug use while holding a \nsensitive position was not alleged in the SOR and may not be an independent basis for \nrevoking his security clearance. Therefore, I have considered it only for the limited \npurposes of considering Applicant's credibility; to evaluate his evidence of mitigation, and \nin my whole-person analysis. See ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006). \nThe following mitigating condition is potentially applicable: \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 26(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment. \nThis mitigating condition is not established. Applicant used marijuana frequently in \n2017. He was not truthful during the clearance adjudication process and was not truthful \nat the hearing. He has a long history of irresponsible behavior. Although his most recent \nmarijuana use was more than three years ago, I am not satisfied that it will not recur if the \npressure of keeping his security clearance is removed. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \nSOR \u00b6 2.a, cross-alleging the conduct in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c, is established by the \nevidence establishing those allegations. The destruction of property in SOR \u00b6 2.b is \nestablished by Applicant\u2019s admission that he poured bleach on his girlfriend\u2019s clothing, \nbut the other criminal activity in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b, 2.c, and 2.f, is not established. Applicant \nadmitted having arguments with his girlfriends caused by his boorish practice of talking \non the cellphone with one girlfriend in the presence of another girlfriend. However, there \nis no evidence that he assaulted, abducted or obstructed the wireless communications of \nany of them. All the complaints by girlfriends were disposed of by nolle prosequi. \nThe complaint of Applicant\u2019s coworker, alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.k, that she was afraid \nto work with Applicant, was not supported by any evidence of conduct causing her fear. \nHowever, the falsifications alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.d, 2.e, 2.g, 2.h-1.j, and 2.l-1.n are \nestablished by Applicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence submitted at the hearing.. \nThe following disqualifying conditions under this guideline are potentially \napplicable: \nAG \u00b616(a): deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, \nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security eligibility \nor trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b616(b): deliberately providing false or misleading information; or \nconcealing or omitting information, concerning relevant facts to an \nemployer, investigator, security official, competent medical or mental health \nprofessional involved in making a recommendation relevant to a national \nsecurity eligibility determination, or other official government representative; \nAG \u00b6 16(c): credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas \nthat is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information; and \nAG \u00b6 16(e): personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's \nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress \nby a foreign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes . . . engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \nAG \u00b6 16(a) is established. Applicant falsified his 2014 e-QIP regarding the basis \nfor his termination of employment in March 2010, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.d, and repeated \nthe same falsification in his 2018- e-QIP, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.h. He failed to disclose \nhis drug use in his 2018 and 2022 e-QIPs, as alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.j and 2.l. This \ndisqualifying condition is not established for the falsification alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.e, alleging \nfailure to disclose that he was charged, convicted, or sentenced for a crime in any court, \nbecause he was charged but not convicted of the offenses alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 2.b, \n2.c, and 2.f, and his explanation that he misunderstood the term \u201ccharged\u201d was credible. \nHowever, his explanation does not mitigate his failure to disclose his conviction and \nsentence for violating a protective order, alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.g. \nAG \u00b6 16(b) is established. Applicant failed to disclose his November 2020 \nmarijuana use during his security interview in October 2022 and his responses to \ninterrogatories in March 2023. \nAG \u00b6 16(c) is established. Applicant\u2019s conviction of violating a protective order, \nstanding alone, would not support a revocation of his clearance, but when considered in \ncombination with his record of marijuana use and multiple falsifications during the \nadjudication of his security clearance application, there is sufficient evidence of \nquestionable judgment to establish this disqualifying condition. \nAG \u00b6 16(e) is established by Applicant\u2019s violation of protective order and marijuana \nuse, which adversely affect his professional and community standing. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially relevant: \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17(a): the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the \nomission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the \nfacts; \nAG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances \nthat it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nAG \u00b6 17(d): the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained \ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate \nthe stressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; \nAG \u00b6 17(f): the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of \nquestionable reliability. \nAG \u00b6 17(a) is not established. Applicant made no efforts to correct his omissions \nbefore the hearing. \nAG \u00b6 17(c) is not established for Applicant\u2019s falsifications. Falsification if an e-QIP \nis a serious offense that undermines the integrity of the clearance adjudication process. \nHis falsifications, alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.d, 2.e, 2.h-2.j, and 2.l-2.n are not mitigated by the \npassage of time, because they reflect a continuing pattern of undermining the security \nclearance adjudication process. It is established for Applicant\u2019s destruction of property as \nalleged in SOR 2.b, which happened in 2008 and is mitigated by the passage of time. It \nis established for the violation of a protective order alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.g, which occurred \nalmost ten years ago and has not been repeated. \nAG \u00b6 17(f) is established for the conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b, 2.c, 2.f, and 2.k, \nwhich were unsubstantiated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines H and E in my whole-person \nanalysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions under those guidelines and evaluating all the evidence in the \ncontext of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns \nraised by his drug involvement and personal conduct. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H (Drug Involvement):  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E (Personal Conduct):  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.c: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.d:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.e and 2.g: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.g-2.j: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.k:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.l-2.n: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation or to hold a sensitive national security position is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn May 30, 2023, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA) \nConsolidated Adjudication Service (CAS) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to \nApplicant detailing reasons why under the criminal conduct guideline the DCSA CAS \ncould not make the preliminary affirmative determination of eligibility for granting a \nsecurity clearance, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine \nwhether a security clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.

The \ncase was assigned to me on October 24, 2023. A hearing was scheduled for December \n7, 2023, and heard as scheduled. At the scheduled hearing, the Government\u2019s case \nconsisted of four exhibits (GEs 1-4) that were admitted without objection. Applicant \nrelied on one witness (herself) and 12 exhibits (AEs A-K) that were admitted without \nobjection. The transcript (Tr.) covering the scheduled hearing was received on \nDecember 23, 2023. \nProcedural Issues \nBefore the close of the hearing, Applicant requested the record be kept open to \npermit her the opportunity to supplement the record with updated medical health \nrecords covering the mental health counseling service she received and a curriculum \nvitae (CV) of her counselor. For good cause shown, she was granted 30 days to \nsupplement the record. Department Counsel was afforded two days to respond. (Tr. 59) \nWithin the time permitted, Applicant supplemented the record with certificates of \ncompletion of course she completed while incarcerated and a CV of her mental health \ncounselor. Applicant\u2019s submissions were admitted without objection as AEs L-M. \nSummary of Pleadings \nUnder Guideline J, Applicant allegedly (a) was arrested and charged in 2008 in \nfederal court with kidnapping (use of facility by offender) and interference with \ncommerce by threat or violence (Hobbs Act violation) and (b) pled guilty to a kidnapping \ncharge. Allegedly, she was sentenced to eight years in prison, followed by five years of \nsupervised release, and ordered to pay $29,281 in restitution. \nIn Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, she admitted the allegations without \nexplanations. She attached nine character references and requested that they be \nconsidered. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 40-year-old employee of a defense contractor who seeks a security \nclearance. The admitted allegations are incorporated and adopted as relevant and \nmaterial findings. Additional findings follow. \nBackground \nApplicant has never married and has no children. (GE 1; Tr. 79) She earned a \nhigh school diploma in June 2002. Between August 2002 and August 2004, she \nattended college classes. She completed additional college classwork between January \n2016 and August 2016 without earning a degree or diploma. Applicant earned an \nassociate\u2019s degree in May 2019 and a bachelor\u2019s degree in fine arts with honors in \nDecember 2021. (GE 1; Tr. 78-79) Currently, she is exploring options of returning to \ncollege to pursue a master\u2019s degree in leadership.

Since August 2022, she has worked for her current \nemployer as an aircraft maintenance mechanic. (GE 1) She reported unemployment \nbetween October 2021 and August 2022. (GE 1) Applicant has never held a security \nclearance. \nApplicant\u2019s criminal history \nIn December 2007, Applicant forced a realtor at gunpoint in her state of \nresidence to withdraw money from her business bank account. (GEs 2 and 4) At the \ntime, she was living in the home she purchased sometime in 2007 with the aid of \nsupplied financial information from her parents. (GE 4; Tr. 42, 45) From the outset, \nApplicant struggled with making her monthly mortgage payments and was working three \njobs as a server and receptionist to make ends meet. (GE 4) Stressed and unable to \nfind help from her mortgage company or other sources (even, reaching out to potential \nroommates), Applicant panicked and turned to exploring illegal alternatives. \nPosing as a foreign person looking to purchase a new home, Applicant enlisted a \nrealtor in December 2007 to take her through a listed home for sale. (GE 4) While in the \nhome, Applicant pulled out a toy gun and told the realtor \u201cthat she was going to die.\u201d \n(GE 4) According to Applicant and supporting investigation records, the realtor initially \nstruggled with Applicant before relenting and accompanying Applicant to the realtor\u2019s \nbank. (GE 4) Once inside the bank, the realtor (within sight of Applicant) instructed the \nteller to release $8,000 from the realtor\u2019s bank account, to which the teller complied. \n(GE 4) With the $8,000 of the realtor\u2019s withdrawn bank funds in hand, Applicant drove \nhome. (GE 4) \nClaiming she was too overcome with financial stress over her mortgage-related \nstruggles to recall the details of the banking incident and timely report them, she \n\u201ccarried on with life\u201d until she was identified by federal investigators as the assailant. \n(GE 4) Once identified, Applicant claims to have become horrified at what she had done \nand feigned disbelief of the incident. (GEs 1 and 4; Tr. 43-45, 49, and 67) Considering \nall of the facts and circumstances surrounding her reported preparations and execution \nof the incident, Applicant\u2019s claims of surprise and anguish are more reconcilable with \ncalculated memory suppression than spontaneous inability to recall the motivational \ndetails that prompted her kidnapping actions. Without documented evidence of \ncognitive-related memory breakdown associated with her actions, her claims can be \nafforded little substantive weight. \nIn April 2008 (four months after her kidnapping offense), Applicant was charged \nwith kidnapping under the Hobbs Act (federal kidnapping statute) and interference with \ncommerce by threat or violence. (GEs 1-4) Court records confirm that she was \nevaluated by a court-appointed mental health professional before being determined by \nthe court to be mentally competent to stand trial. (GE 2) \nIn December 2009, Applicant entered into a plea agreement with federal \nprosecutors. (GE 2) Because the terms of her plea agreement remained sealed, they \nare not available for external review. (GE 2).

(GEs 1-4; Tr. 41) The court\u2019s docket text confirmed the entry of judgment \nagainst Applicant with the incorporated sentence in May 2010 (revised in July 2012). \n(GE 2) Court records document mental health treatment while incarcerated. (GE 2) As a \npart of her supervised release conditions, Applicant, inter alia, was directed to \nparticipate and successfully complete substance abuse and mental health treatment \nprograms. (GEs 2 and 4) \nApplicant reported no court-ordered mental health counseling in the electronic \nquestionnaires for investigations processing (e-QIP) she completed in August 2022 (GE \n1), despite claiming a mental health breakdown associated with her kidnapping incident \nand her acknowledged post-release order to consult a mental health professional. Court \nrecords do not reflect any raised mental health issues preparatory to her guilty plea and \nensuing sentencing. From her produced training materials, Applicant appears to have \ntaken full advantage of prison-offered training courses designed to help her achieve \nsuccess with her life and documented a number of certificates of completed courses \nwhile in incarceration. (AE L; Tr. 43-45) \nFor good behavior, Applicant was granted early release from prison in \nSeptember 2016, after five and one-half years of imprisonment. (Tr. 41, 49-50) While on \nsupervised probation, Applicant resided in a halfway house, where she enjoyed ingress \nand egress privileges. (Tr. 44, 53) She expressed remorse for her actions and currently \nattends regular Catholic church services to help her atone for her prior mistakes and \nactions. (Tr. 39-40) And, she is credited with satisfying the court-ordered $29,281 fine \nimposed on her. (GE 4)    \nComplaining of depression following her release from prison, Applicant accepted \na U.S. probation office referral to a licensed mental health consulting service in 2016. \n(AE I; Tr. 54-55) Among her post-hearing submissions, Applicant provided a CV of the \nprofessional counselor she consulted with following her release from federal \nincarceration. (AEs I and M) This credentialed licensed family therapist is credited with \nearning a master\u2019s degree in clinical psychology and specializing in family mental health \nissues. (AE M). She is of record in providing mental health counseling services to \nApplicant following her U.S. probation referral acceptance. (AE I) The therapist\u2019s \nindividualized treatment plan covered mental health issues, relapse prevention, \ncommunity integration, and learning skills to manage symptoms unique to people \ndiagnosed with mental health disorders. (AE I) Applicant\u2019s therapist described \nApplicant\u2019s individual sessions and credited her with a willingness to explore past mal-\nadaptive coping strategies. (AEs I and M) \nApplicant was credited by her mental health provider with successfully \ncompleting her treatment program in 2018, with both good support from her treatment \nteam and a positive prognosis for employing her learning skills in rebuilding and \nrepairing her relationships at home and in her community.

Upon pleading guilty to the charges without \nany evidence of a mental breakdown defense, Applicant was sentenced to eight years \nin prison, followed by five years of supervised release, and was ordered to pay $29,281 \nin restitution. Records document that Applicant was early released in 2016 after serving \nfive-plus years of her prison sentence. \nApplicant\u2019s criminal conviction and sentencing warrant the application of one \ndisqualifying condition (DCs) of the Adjudicative Guidelines (AGs) for criminal conduct. \nApplicable to Applicant\u2019s situation is DC \u00b6 31(b), \u201cevidence (including, but not limited to, \na credible allegation, an admission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, \nregardless of whether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s federal kidnapping charge and conviction covered an exceptionally \nserious felony and one that resulted in a lengthy prison sentence (eight years) imposed \non her by the federal court taking her guilty plea. Applicant\u2019s guilty plea was accepted \nby the court without any received evidence of a mental breakdown by Applicant \npreceding the kidnapping incident. She has expressed remorse for her actions and has \ntaken full advantage of the learning and mental health treatment programs made \navailable to her during her five-plus years of incarceration and post-release probation. \nAnd, she has made considerable progress in her post-release educational pursuits \n(earning a bachelor\u2019s degree in fine arts) and securing a good job in the defense \ncontractor field. \nStill, Applicant can be credited with little more than two years of time since she \ncompleted her post-release probation, and she was unable to document the mental \nbreakdown she claims to have experienced prior to her 2007 kidnapping incident. For \nsuch a serious violation of federal law, safe predictions of recurrence aversion cannot \nbe made at this time. Applicant\u2019s federal kidnapping conviction and lengthy \nincarceration placed a heavy burden on her to establish the level of rehabilitation \nnecessary for the restoration of trust, reliability, and good judgment required to mitigate \nrecurrence risks.

Taking into \naccount Applicant\u2019s credited defense contributions, her criminal history, her \nconsiderable rehabilitation efforts to date, and the strong character references she has \nreceived from her supervisor and friends who have known her for many years, she is \ncredited with substantial progress in restoring the trust, reliability, and good judgment \nnecessary to hold a security clearance. \nBecause of the seriousness of her federal kidnapping offense, more time is \nneeded to mitigate the Government\u2019s security concerns and restore the high level of \ntrust, reliability, and good judgment required for eligibility to hold a security clearance. \nWhile her progress with her rehabilitation efforts is encouraging and filled with promise, \nthey are not enough at this time to surmount the Government\u2019s security concerns.

(Tr. 16-23; GE 1, 4) \nIn the SOR, the Government alleged that Applicant had 21 delinquent debts \ntotaling approximately $44,000 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.u). These delinquencies consist \nof educational loans (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.r), an insurance premium (SOR \u00b6 1.b), a \ntelecommunication debt (SOR \u00b6 1.c), credit cards (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d through 1.h, 1.j through \n1.o, 1.q, 1.t, and 1.u), an automobile loan (SOR \u00b6 1.p), and personal loans (SOR \u00b6 1.i \nand 1.s). He admitted the SOR allegations except for the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.e, \n1.f, 1.p, and 1.r. His admissions are adopted as findings of fact. The SOR allegations \nare established through his admissions and the Government\u2019s credit reports. (SOR; \nAnswer; GE 2-4) \nApplicant became delinquent on most of the SOR debts in early 2019. After his \ndelinquencies began, he had a payment arrangement on the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g, 1.h, \n1.i, 1.k, and 1.l for a few months each between 2019 and 2021. However, he stopped \nmaking payments on those payment arrangements by 2021, because he could not \nafford them. He has not re-contacted those creditors to resolve those debts since he \ndefaulted on his payment arrangements. He disputed the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a with a \ncredit reporting agency because he thought he had timely canceled the loan. He did not \ndispute the debt with the creditor and provided no documentation regarding his dispute. \nHe has not resolved or made payments on the other accounts listed in the SOR. (Tr. 16-\n26, 34-40; Answer; GE 2-4)  \nApplicant plans to attempt to resolve the SOR debts by filing bankruptcy. He has \nnot decided between filing a petition in Chapter 13 bankruptcy or a petition in Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy, but he is leaning towards filing a Chapter 7 petition. He has consulted with \nan attorney but has not paid the attorney the $2,500 retainer fee the attorney requires. \nApplicant will not be able to afford to pay this retainer fee until he finds full-time \nemployment, for which he is currently looking. He has started working on the \u201cbooklet\u201d \nthat he needs to complete to file a bankruptcy petition. He has not taken the required \nfinancial counseling course. He last spoke with this attorney in January 2024. (Tr. 26-\n34, 40, 47) \nApplicant\u2019s financial delinquencies were largely caused by his fianc\u00e9e\u2019s health \nproblems. In early 2019, she began suffering from a health condition that required her to \nbe in the hospital on dialysis for weeks at a time, several times per year. In March 2022, \nhe quit a steady, well-paying job to relocate so that he could live with her to help her \nwhile she was ill.

His fianc\u00e9e earns about $2,000 every two weeks in take-home pay. She also \nworks another part-time job where she works 20 to 30 hours per week and earns $18 \nper hour.

In 2020, he financed the purchase of a 2021 automobile. He put down $2,000 in \ncash and his payments were $900 per month. He became delinquent on this account in \nabout February 2023, after he moved to live with his fianc\u00e9e, and the vehicle was \nvoluntarily repossessed. He owes about $9,000 on this account. (Tr. 40-44) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant had 21 delinquent SOR debts totaling about $44,000. Many of those \ndebts have been delinquent for several years. The above-referenced disqualifying \nconditions are established. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nWhile acknowledging that Applicant\u2019s delinquencies arose almost entirely due to \ncircumstances that were beyond his control, he has not resolved any of his SOR debts. \nHe has also become delinquent on another account that he opened after he was having \nfinancial difficulties because of his fianc\u00e9e\u2019s illness. While he plans to file bankruptcy to \nresolve his delinquencies, because of his lack of adequate income, it is unclear when or \nif he will be able to do so. He has not received financial counseling. He disputed the \ndebt in SOR \u00b6 1.a with a credit reporting agency, but he did not dispute it with the \ncreditor, and he did not provide any documentation to substantiate that he had \nappropriately cancelled the loan pursuant to its terms. His financial issues are ongoing, \nand he has not established a track record of financial responsibility. His lack of \nresolution of his delinquencies means he failed to show that he acted responsibly under \nthe circumstances or that he made a good-faith effort to resolve his debts. None of the \nmitigating conditions fully apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I am sympathetic to \nApplicant and his fianc\u00e9e for her serious health problems. However, I must still follow \nthe Directive to determine security clearance eligibility, and I must resolve any doubts in \nfavor of national security. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.u: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nBenjamin R. Dorsey \nAdministrative Judge \n6 \n",

The \ncase was assigned to me on January 22, 2024. On January 31, 2024, DOHA issued a \nnotice scheduling the hearing for March 19, 2024, to occur virtually through an online \nplatform. \nI convened Applicant\u2019s hearing as scheduled. Department Counsel offered \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4. Government Exhibits 1 and 4 were admitted \nwithout objection. Government Exhibits 2 and 3 are discussed below. Applicant testified \nand submitted three documents, which were marked as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A, B, \nand C, all of which were admitted without objection. \nGovernment Exhibit 2 is an unauthenticated summary of Applicant\u2019s November \n2022 background interview. He adopted it as accurate subject to one change: he \nrequested that one sentence, \u201cThe only drug used is marijuana.\u201d be changed to \u201cThe \nonly drug used is Delta-8/THC.\u201d (GE 2 at 2) This was done without objection and GE 2 \nwas admitted. (Tr. 19-23) \nGovernment Exhibit 3 is an interrogatory response submitted by Applicant to \nDOD in January 2023. For many of the questions asked, he was supposed to check \nboxes marked \u201cYES\u201d or \u201cNO\u201d with the opportunity for comment. On the copy of GE 3 \nsubmitted by Department Counsel, it appeared that Applicant had not fully done so, as \nseveral answers were blank. (GE 3) In fact, as he clarified at hearing, Applicant had \nanswered all the questions, checking various boxes with a yellow highlighter. I \nconstrued his clarifying comments as an objection to GE 3 on grounds of completeness. \nHe then submitted a complete copy of GE 3 as Applicant Exhibit A, with the highlights \nvisible. Both GE 3 and AE A were admitted. (Tr. 23-32) \nSua sponte, near the end of the hearing, I took administrative notice of a \nmemorandum issued by the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) (Administrative \nNotice (AN) I). discussed below and provided it to the parties.

(GE 1 at 27) He also said, \u201cit is good to use as a relaxant,\u201d similar to \ntobacco. He asserted his understanding that THC has \u201cless impact on health than \ntobacco\u201d and he does not smoke cigarettes. He said, \u201cI believe that THC has less \nimpact on cognitive impairment than alcohol\u201d and as long as it is used in moderation, \nthere would be no \u201crepercussions.\u201d He said, \u201cI am willing to cease use as long as it is \nbanned while I have my clearance but I would like to continue use if at all possible.\u201d (GE \n1 at 28; Tr. 41-42) \nApplicant had a background interview in November 2022. He confirmed the \ninformation he disclosed on his SCA. He said he used Delta-8/THC at his residence and \nwith his friends. (As noted above, in adopting GE 2 as an accurate summary of his \ninterview, he said \u201cThe only drug used is Delta-8/THC,\u201d not \u201cmarijuana.\u201d). He said the \ndrug was obtained from his friend, B. He said his last use of the drug was in September \n2022. He used the drug to relax and socialize. He had not had any drug counseling, \ntreatment, counseling, or education classes. He did not socialize with anyone who uses \nmarijuana other than his friend, B. He said, \u201cthis is likely to occur again, though \n[Applicant] clarified he would stop usage if required to obtain a security clearance.\u201d (GE \n2 at 2) \nIn January 2023, Applicant responded to an interrogatory from DOD about his \nhistory of drug use and his future intentions. (GE 3, AE A) He said his last use of \nmarijuana at that point was on December 30, 2022, when he \u201csmoked a blunt at a New \nYear\u2019s party. He said he stopped using marijuana \u201cin order to obtain a security \nclearance and maintain job integrity.\u201d He checked or highlighted \u201cNO\u201d when asked if he \nintended to illegally use marijuana in the future. (AE A at 3; Tr. 42) \nApplicant did not list any \u201ccurrent\u201d use of illegal drugs.

The policy cites and notes its compliance with the federal Drug-Free \nWorkplace Act of 1988. The policy applies to faculty, staff, full-time, part-time, student, \ntemporary, intermittent, and contract employees. Much of the policy concerns drug \ninvolvement on campus, drug-related criminal charges, arrests and convictions, drug \ntesting, and an employee assistance program (EAP). Applicant understood the policy to \nprohibit use at work, \u201cnot outside recreational use.\u201d (GE 4; Tr. 35, 48) \nApplicant had not seen the university\u2019s drug policy (GE 4) until he looked it up in \nJanuary 2023 while responding to DOD\u2019s interrogatory. Before then, he was generally \naware of it. It He believed the policy only concerned a ban on \u201con-premises\u201d drug use. \nHe believed that employees who were working on DOD or other federal contracts were \nbanned from any drug use; however, he was not one of those employees. He said his \nprevious work as a \u201cco-op\u201d employee was not on DOD or other government contracts, \nthough he does work on such contracts now. As a co-op intern, he had worked in the \nresearch institute\u2019s information technology (IT) department. (Tr. 49-53, 63-64, 75, 79) \nApplicant signed GE 4 in January 2023. (GE 4 at 5; Tr. 62-63) He acknowledged \nthat he may have received prior trainings when he began working as a university co-op \nemployee, including, perhaps, \u201ca slide or two\u201d on illegal drug use. (Tr. 62-64) He \nbelieved he was allowed to use illegal drugs under the policy as long as it was not on \ncampus. (Tr. 63-64) \nApplicant asserted his belief that his use of marijuana was not \u201cillegal\u201d because it \nwas \u201cin accordance with\u201d (i.e., legal under) State 1 law. He understands that he is \napplying for a federal security clearance and understands that \u201cany sort of marijuana-\nrelated use is considered illegal under the U.S. government.\u201d (Tr. 34, 42) \nApplicant said he first tried Delta-8/THC in March 2022. He was unsure if his next \nuse was in September 2022, as he said in his background interview (GE 2 at 2) or \nOctober 2022, as he said in his interrogatory response.

(AE A at 5; Tr. 43-45) He \nsaid this was with friends he has not seen since then. (Tr. 60-61) He clarified his \nreference to use in \u201cmoderation\u201d by explaining that his use was only a \u201cpuff\u201d or \u201chit\u201d \nbefore passing it on to someone else and not a \u201cfull blunt\u201d or marijuana cigarette. (Tr. \n58) \nApplicant said he was not aware whether B uses marijuana, though B has used \nDelta-8/THC legally under State 1 law. Applicant has not seen B do so in several \nmonths, in their apartment. That instance was the last time Applicant was around \nsomeone who was using marijuana or Delta-8. Applicant no longer socializes with the \nother people with whom he used marijuana, in either March 2022 or December 2022. \nHe has never been charged or cited for a drug-related offense. (Tr. 61-62, 74, 76-77) \nApplicant said he was asked by his employer to apply for a clearance in \nSeptember 2022 not through his co-op internship job (which was an unclassified \nposition job in the IT department), but rather for a classified position in the lab, since \nseveral people had left employment there. (Tr. 67) He had his background interview \nabout two months later, in November 2022. (GE 2; Tr. 69) \nApplicant also explained that his co-op internship at the university research \ninstitute ended when he graduated in December 2022, and at that point he had not \nreceived a job offer, from them or anyone else. (Tr. 37-38) The university operates on \nan academic schedule, and he received the offer to return as a full-time employee in \nmid-January 2023 and he went back to work that month. (Tr. 38-41, 45-47, 53-54, 65-\n66, 74) \nThus, when Applicant used marijuana in late December 2022, he was \nunemployed, if briefly. He therefore considered his clearance background investigation \n\u201cnull and void\u201d since he was unemployed and no job offer was pending at that time. He \ndid acknowledge that he was hopeful about a job offer and even expected to hear from \nthem (as he did, weeks later). (Tr. 45-47, 64-65, 71-73, 91-92) \nApplicant denied any use of marijuana or Delta-8/THC since late December \n2022. He said he stopped because of \u201cthis clearance application, more than anything,\u201d \nsince he was now under federal jurisdiction as a clearance applicant. (Tr. 42, 52) \nApplicant initially stated that he would not use marijuana or other illegal drugs in \nthe future while he held a clearance. He said he believes that marijuana should not be \nclassified as an illegal substance. However, he clarified that he understands that \nmarijuana is illegal under federal law and said he would comply with the law and not use \nmarijuana in the future. (Tr. 54-56) He affirmed in closing that he did not intend to \nviolate federal law when he used marijuana since when he used it, doing so was legal \nunder State 1 law. (Tr. 90-91) \nNear the end of his testimony, Applicant\u2019s attention was drawn to the opportunity \nto provide a signed statement of intent not to use marijuana or illegal drugs in the future \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(citing Guideline H mitigating condition AG \u00b6 26(b)(3)), as well as materials for \nconsideration under the whole person concept.

As the \nSupreme Court has held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on \nmere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information.

Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in this guideline \nto describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe following disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 25 are potentially applicable: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse.  \nThe Controlled Substances Act (\u201cCSA\u201d) makes it illegal under Federal law to \nmanufacture, possess, or distribute certain drugs, including marijuana. (Controlled \nSubstances Act, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 801, et seq. See \u00a7 844). All controlled substances are \nclassified into five schedules, based on their accepted medical uses, their potential for \nabuse, and their psychological and physical effects on the body. \u00a7\u00a7811, 812. Marijuana \nis classified as a Schedule I controlled substance, \u00a7812(c), based on its high potential \nfor abuse, no accepted medical use, and no accepted safety for use in medically \nsupervised treatment. \u00a7812(b)(1). See Gonzales v. Raich, 545 U.S. 1 (2005). \nOn December 21, 2021, the DNI issued a memorandum entitled, \u201cSecurity \nExecutive Clarifying Guidance Concerning Marijuana for Agencies Conducting \nAdjudications of Persons Proposed for Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position.\u201d (2021 DNI Memo) The memo incorporates the \nAGs (at reference B) among various other relevant federal laws, executive orders, and \nmemoranda. I take administrative notice of the 2021 DNI memo here, and I provided it \nto the parties after the hearing. (Tr. 92-93; HE III) \nThe 2021 DNI memo specifically notes that \u201cunder policy set forth in SEAD 4's \nadjudicative guidelines, the illegal use or misuse of controlled substances can raise \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsecurity concerns about an individual's reliability and trustworthiness to access \nclassified information or to hold a sensitive position, as well as their ability or willingness \nto comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\u201d Thus, consistent with these references, the \nAGs indicate that \u201cdisregard of federal law pertaining to marijuana remains relevant, but \nnot determinative, to adjudications of eligibility for access to classified information or \neligibility to hold a sensitive position.\u201d (2021 DNI Memo) (HE III) \nApplicant used marijuana or Delta-8/THC on three occasions during 2022. The \nfirst two instances (March 2022 and September or October 2022) were alleged in the \nSOR (SOR \u00b6 1.a). He disclosed those uses on his SCA and discussed them in his \nNovember 2022 background interview. AG \u00b6 25(a) applies to SOR \u00b6 1.a. (The third use, \nin late December 2022, was not alleged in the SOR, though it will be discussed below, \nunder mitigation). \nApplicant used the marijuana in 2022 because recreational marijuana use had \nbeen legalized in State 1, where he lived and went to school (and where he lives now). \nHe knew that it was illegal under federal law. He suggested on his SCA and in his \nbackground interview that he \u201cwould like to continue use if at all possible.\u201d (GE 1 at 28) \nand that his use \u201cis likely to occur again,\u201d though [he] clarified he would stop usage if \nrequired to obtain a security clearance.\u201d (GE 2 at 2) This suggests application of AG \u00b6 \n25(g) as well. \nHowever, Applicant\u2019s intended future use was not alleged in the SOR. Further, \nwhile he believes that marijuana should not be classified as an illegal substance, he \nconfirmed that he understands that marijuana is illegal under federal law and said he \nwould comply with the law and not use marijuana in the future. Thus AG \u00b6 25(g) does \nnot apply. \nI have considered the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand  \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) \nchanging or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) \nproviding a signed statement of intent to abstain from all  drug involvement \nand substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility.  \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nDuring 2022, Applicant used marijuana or THC three times. Each time was brief \nand his overall use was infrequent. He did so, in part, because recreational marijuana \nuse was recently legalized in State 1, where he was in school. All of his use was either \nduring, or within only days after he graduated from, college. It is true that he was \nworking for the university in their co-op program, and all university employees (including \nstudents) were subject to the university drug policy, GE 4. Applicant acknowledged that \nhe knew using marijuana was illegal under federal law at the time. \nNevertheless, I find Applicant\u2019s testimony about the circumstances of his \nDecember 2022 use credible. He had just graduated from college. His co-op program \nwas over, and, if only for the moment, he was unemployed. Yes, he had submitted his \nSCA in September 2022 and had a background interview in November 2022. But at that \ntime that he was unemployed, with no guarantee that he would be rehired. While his \nchoice to use marijuana in this circumstance was poor judgment, I do not see it as fatal \nto his prospects here. \nI also credit Applicant\u2019s disavowal of future drug use. His brief drug use was \neither during or very shortly after college. While his use is relatively recent, there is no \nevidence that he has used it since then. It also occurred before he received his post-\ncollege job offer to return to the university, in January 2023. He used marijuana once \nwith B, his friend and roommate. He last saw B use marijuana several months before \nthe hearing and he has disassociated himself from the other people with whom he used \nmarijuana. He is also more clearly aware of his employer\u2019s drug policy and his need to \nabstain from marijuana use under federal law. I find that Applicant\u2019s infrequent, college-\nera drug use is unlikely to recur, and no longer casts doubt on his current judgment, \ntrustworthiness, and reliability. AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b)(1) and (2) apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.

Applicant admits that in April of 2019, almost five years ago, she was arrested \nfor Driving Under the Influence of alcohol (DUI). She also failed a field sobriety test. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of EO 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order \nadverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall \nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive \ninformation). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant had past-due debts totaling in excess of $21,000. \nAG \u00b6 19 includes two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts,\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of \nnot meeting financial obligations.\u201d The record establishes these disqualifying conditions. \nFurther inquiry is necessary about the potential application of any mitigating conditions. \nThe security concerns raised in the SOR may be mitigated by any of the following \npotentially applicable factors: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAlthough Applicant can attribute many of her financial difficulties to a divorce and \nto medical emergencies, her financial problems are not under control. Applicant still has \nover $12,000 in past-due debts she has yet to address. Applicant failed to meet her \nburden to mitigate the financial concerns set out in the SOR. For these reasons, I find \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.i. against Applicant. \nGuideline G - Alcohol Consumption \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Alcohol Consumption is set out \nin AG \u00b6 21: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 22 contains seven conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying. One condition may apply: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder. \nApplicant had a DUI arrest in April 2019, during which she failed the field sobriety \ntest. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 23 contains four conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. One condition may apply: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment.  \nApplicant\u2019s DUI arrest occurred nearly five years ago.

After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and \nexhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 49 years old.

(Item 4) \nIn September 2022, Applicant completed a security clearance application (SCA). \nIn response to Section 23 about any illegal drug use in the last seven years, he responded \nthat he possessed a medical marijuana card issued to him by his state. He stated that he \nperiodically consumes \u201c1/8 ML of CBD oil which contains the cannabinoid THC. The dose \nof CBD/THC is less than 5 mg.\u201d He takes this dose three to five times a week at bedtime. \nHe takes it for ailments related to his disability. He obtains the drug from a dispensary in \nhis state. He stated that he answered \u201cyes\u201d to the question about illegally purchasing \ndrugs because he believed purchasing Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) from a state \ndispensary is still considered illegal under federal law. He is aware that his use of THC is \nlegal under his state\u2019s law but is illegal under federal law. He renewed his medical \nmarijuana card in May 2022. He indicated on his SCA that he intended to use this drug in \nthe future as prescribed by his doctor. (Item 4) \nIn October 2022, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator. He \ndisclosed to the investigator that he was prescribed medical marijuana by his doctor. His \nappointments were online, and he will have annual appointments. His last appointment \nwas May 2022. He planned to continue to purchase and use medical marijuana. He used \nit at home and around his spouse. He used it to help control anxiety and to help him sleep. \nHe has not participated in drug counseling or drug treatment. He has not been diagnosed \nfor drug abuse or dependency. He did not use any other illegal drugs to include the misuse \nof prescription drugs. He did not associate with individuals who use drugs illegally. His \nspouse and friends were aware he uses medical marijuana. His did not believe his use of \nmedical marijuana has contributed to any personal, financial, criminal, legal, security or \ndisciplinary issues. He had not used any other illegal drugs other than the medical \nmarijuana. He planned to continue to use medical marijuana until another course of \ntreatment is prescribed. (Item 5) \nIn Applicant\u2019s SOR answer, he admitted his use and purchase of THC with varying \ndegrees from May 2021 to the present (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b). He reaffirmed that he \nintended to continue using CBD oil that contains THC that he was prescribed until his \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndoctor recommends another course of treatment (SOR \u00b6 1.c). Applicant did not respond \nto the FORM, so no new information was provided.1 \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \n1 The Security Executive Agent for the United States Government provided clarifying guidance concerning \nmarijuana on December 21, 2021. Part of that guidance addressed CBD products: \nWith respect to the use of CBD products, agencies should be aware that using these \ncannabis derivatives may be relevant to adjudications in accordance with SEAD 4. \nAlthough the passage of the Agricultural Improvement Act of 2018 excluded hemp from \nthe definition of marijuana within the Controlled Substances Act, products containing \ngreater than a 0.3 percent concentration of delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), a \npsychoactive ingredient in marijuana, do not meet the definition of \u201chemp.\u201d Accordingly, \nproducts labeled as hemp-derived that contain greater than 0.3 percent THC continue to \nmeet the legal definition of marijuana, and therefore remain illegal to use under federal law \nand policy. Additionally, agencies should be aware that the Federal Drug Administration \ndoes not certify levels of THC in CBD products, so the percentage of THC cannot be \nguaranteed, thus posing a concern pertaining to the use of a CBD product under federal \nlaw. Studies have shown that some CBD products exceed the 0.3 percent THC threshold \nfor hemp, notwithstanding advertising labels (Reference F). Therefore, there is a risk that \nusing these products may nonetheless cause sufficiently high levels of THC to result in a \npositive marijuana test under agency-administered employment or random drug testing \nprograms. Should an individual test positive, they will be subject to an investigation under \nspecific guidelines established by their home agency.  \nThe Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMSHA) provided a warning \nabout CBD products on July 24, 2019: \nStudies have shown that some CBD products\u2019 labeling does not accurately reflect their \ncontent. Cannabis based products containing a THC level greater than 0.3% on a dry \nweight basis do not fall under the Farm Bill\u2019s definition of hemp even if they are labeled as \nsuch. In one study, the amount of CBD in 69% of the 84 tested CBD products was \ninconsistent with that on the label, and some products contained unlabeled cannabinoids, \nincluding THC in amounts up to 6.4 mg/ml. As such, an employee\u2019s drug test may be \npositive for the THC metabolite, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol-9-carboxylic acid (THCA), \ndue to THC in the CBD product.  \nSAMSHA further advised that \u201cfederal agencies should make every effort to inform applicants and \nemployees of the risk that using such products may result in a positive marijuana test.\u201d \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for drug involvement and substance \nmisuse is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations.  \nAG \u00b6 25 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) any substance misuse;  \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution, or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and  \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \nApplicant used THC with varying frequency from May 2021 to the present. It was \nprescribed to him by a doctor in a state where it is legal under state law. He did this \nbefore and after applying for a security clearance and with the knowledge it was illegal \nunder federal law. He purchased THC from about May 2021 to the present. He intended \nto continue to use and purchase THC in the future. The above disqualifying conditions \napply. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom drug involvement and substance misuse. The following mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 26 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions to overcome the problem, and has \nestablished a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were being used; and (3) providing \na signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \nApplicant acknowledged his use of THC is illegal under federal law. He planned to \ncontinue to use and purchase THC. His decision to continue to use THC despite its \nprohibition under federal law raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to \ncomply with laws, rules, and regulations. I find the above mitigating conditions do not \napply. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline H, in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant failed to meet his burden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves me \nwith questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns \narising under Guideline H, drug involvement and substance misuse. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

(Item 2) 2 Applicant\u2019s e-QIP omissions and criminal history Asked to complete an e-QIP in July 2022, Applicant omitted material facts specifically related to his September 2021 arrest and charge for felony battery/domestic violence by strangulation when responding to the information covered by section 22 of his e-QIP about felony arrests and charges. Applicant responded negatively, as well, to the questions covered by section 22 of his e-QIP about all prior arrests (both felony and non-felony) without any explanations for his denials. In a follow-up personal subject interview (PSI) with an investigator from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) in September 2022, Applicant was asked whether he had any prior criminal offenses covered in section 22 of his July 2022 e-QIP.

Administrative Judge \nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, \nApplicant did not mitigate personal conduct and criminal conduct concerns. Eligibility for \naccess to classified information or to hold a sensitive position is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn April 4, 2023, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA) \nConsolidated Adjudications Services (CAS) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to \nApplicant detailing reasons why under the personal conduct and criminal conduct \nguidelines the DCSA CAS could not make the preliminary affirmative determination of \neligibility for granting a security clearance, and recommended referral to an \nadministrative judge to determine whether a security clearance should be granted, \ncontinued, denied, or revoked. The action was taken under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960); \nDepartment of Defense (DoD) Directive 5220.6 Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program, (January 2, 1992) (Directive); and Security Executive \nAgent Directive 4, establishing in Appendix A the National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to \nHold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective June 8, 2017. \n1 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on May 21, 2023, and requested a decision on \nthe written record in lieu of a hearing. Applicant received the File of Relevant Materials \n(FORM) on October 17, 2023, He was afforded an opportunity to respond to the FORM, \nbut did not object to any of the Government\u2019s submissions or supplement the record. \nThe case was assigned to me on February 6, 2024. \nSummary of Pleadings \nUnder Guideline E, Applicant allegedly falsified his electronic questionnaires of \ninvestigations processing (e-QIP) of July 13, 2022, by omitting in his response to the \ninformation requested under Section 22 of his e-QIP his arrest and charge within the \npast seven years of felony/battery/domestic violence by strangulation in September \n2021. Allegedly, he also falsified his e-QIP of July 13, 2022, by omitting the same \nSeptember 2021 felony arrest and charge information under Section 22 of his e-QIP in \nthe space calling for the listing of felony charges and convictions, regardless of the date \nof the offense or offenses. \nUnder Guideline J, Applicant allegedly was arrested and charged with multiple \ncriminal violations between June 2004 and September 2021. Allegedly, he was arrested \nand charged (a) in September 2021 with felony battery/domestic violence by \nstrangulation; (b) in January 2011 with violating probation; (c) in January 2010 with \nspeeding/driving on a suspended license; (d) in July 2005 with family violence: battery, \ncruelty to children/criminal trespass; in September 2004 with driving on a suspended \nlicense; and in June 2004 for battery/cruelty to children. \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted and denied in part the allegations \ncovered by SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1,b. He claimed his omissions were not intentional and \nwere based on misunderstandings of the questions raised. Addressing the allegations \ncovered by SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a-2.f, Applicant admitted each of the allegations with \nexplanations. He claimed the charges covered by SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a-2.b, 2.d and 2.f were \ndismissed. He further claimed the charges covered by SOR \u00b6 2.e were resolved with a \nfine.

Applicant responded negatively, as well, to \nthe questions covered by section 22 of his e-QIP about all prior arrests (both felony and \nnon-felony) without any explanations for his denials. \nIn a follow-up personal subject interview (PSI) with an investigator from the Office \nof Personnel Management (OPM) in September 2022, Applicant was asked whether he \nhad any prior criminal offenses covered in section 22 of his July 2022 e-QIP. (Item 3) \nBefore asking for Applicant\u2019s responses, the investigator prefaced each of his questions \nwith his emphasis on any offenses Applicant could recollect over his entire life. (Item 3) \nResponding to the investigator\u2019s question, Applicant answered that he had not. (Item 3) \nAfter noting Applicant\u2019s negative answers, the investigator confronted Applicant with his \nreported prior arrests between 2004 and 2021. \nAddressing the questions posed in Applicant\u2019s July 2022 e-QIP, Applicant \nadmitted each of the offenses inquired about by the OPM investigator with explanations \nand clarifications about the circumstances of the incidents and the dispositions. (Item 3) \nWhen asked by the investigator why he did not report these incidents in hi 2022 e-QIP, \nApplicant explained he either thought the incident could potentially look negatively \nagainst him (viz., the 2021 strangulation incident), or he could not recall the details of \nthe incidents (viz., the remaining 2004-2005 and 2010-2011 traffic-related, family \nviolence, driving on a suspended license, and battery/cruelty to children offenses. ((Item \n3) \nConsidered together, Applicant\u2019s 2022 e-QIP omissions and post-e-QIP PSI \nadmissions (only made after confrontation by the interviewing OPM investigator), and \noverall credibility assessment, warrant drawn inferences that his withholding of material \ninformation about his past arrests and charges were the result of a lack of candor and \njudgment lapses. Never voluntarily corrected with prompt, good faith explanations, \nApplicant\u2019s material omissions create continuing security concerns about his honesty \nand trustworthiness, \nOther incidents covered in the SOR reflect acts of physical abuse and disregard \nof his state\u2019s traffic laws.

Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe AGs list guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision-making \nprocess covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that could \ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as \nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. \nThese aforementioned guidelines include conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of the \nconditions that could mitigate security concerns, if any. These guidelines must be \nconsidered before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, \ncontinued, or denied. Although, the guidelines do not require judges to place exclusive \nreliance on the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the guidelines in \narriving at a decision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context \nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \n4 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n                                               \nPersonal Conduct \nThe Concern: Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack f candor, \ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can \nraise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information.

AG \u00b6 30. \nBurdens of Proof \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. \nDecisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant \nmay deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such decisions \nentail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, rather than \nactual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Exec. Or. 12968 (Aug. \n2, 1995), \u00a7 3.1. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d   See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

The \nrelevant government contractor offered him a job in June 2022 that was conditioned \nupon him graduating from college and obtaining a security clearance. He earned an \nundergraduate degree in December 2022 with a 3.69 grade point average (GPA), \nincluding a 4.0 GPA during his last two semesters. He has never married and has no \nchildren. (Tr. 18-19, 25-26; GE 1, 2; AE D, E) \nFrom about June 2021 until about March 2023, Applicant used marijuana with \nvarying frequency. He purchased it once from a dispensary in State A in June 2021. He \nestimated that he used it socially with friends about 20 times during this period. At all \ntimes relevant to this security clearance investigation, marijuana purchase and \npossession (and therefore its use) has been illegal under federal law. However, \npursuant to state laws in State A, where he resided while he used marijuana, its use has \nbeen legal. In July 2022, while he was still in college, Applicant completed and certified \nan Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (SF 86). He continued to use \nmarijuana for several months after completing the SF 86 and after his September 2022 \nsecurity interview with a DOD investigator. (Tr. 17, 19-26, 32-35; Answer; GE 1, 2) \nApplicant stopped using marijuana after he received the Government\u2019s \ninterrogatories in March 2023, as he realized that marijuana use was incompatible with \nholding a security clearance. Prior to then, he thought using marijuana was acceptable \nbecause it was legal pursuant to the laws in State A, because he had not started \nworking for a government contractor, and he did not have access to any classified \ninformation. While he used marijuana after being granted an interim security clearance, \nhe was not notified that he had earned one. (Tr. 17, 19-26, 32-35; Answer; GE 1, 2) \nApplicant now understands that marijuana is not compatible with holding a \nsecurity clearance and will hinder his career development. Now that he is out of college, \nhe has shifted his focus to obtaining his first post-college job and being a responsible \nadult. He also now understands that being involved with marijuana is illegal, regardless \nof what state laws seem to indicate. He acknowledged that he was immature and did \nnot understand the seriousness of illegal drug use. He has no future intent to purchase, \npossess, or use marijuana or other illegal drugs and provided a signed statement of \nintent to that effect. He also no longer associates with anyone who is involved with \nillegal drugs. I observed him testify and found him to be credible. (Tr. 17, 24-30, 32-33; \nAnswer; GE 1, 2; AE A-C) \nApplicant provided a copy of a January 2024 urinalysis test result that was \nnegative for several illegal drugs, including marijuana. He received a leadership and \ncommunity engagement award from his university in the fall of 2022. He also provided \ncharacter-reference letters from a former work colleague and friends who wrote that he \nis trustworthy, loyal, hardworking, and a leader.

(Tr. 17, 24-30, 32-33; Answer; GE 1, \n2; AE A-C) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern for drug involvement and substance misuse is set out in AG \n\u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 25. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia. \nApplicant used marijuana, an illegal drug, with varying frequency between June \n2021 and March 2023. The above listed disqualifying conditions are established. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nIt has been about one year since Applicant last used an illegal drug. He used it \nwhile he was in college in his early 20s and before he joined the workforce. While he did \nnot understand the distinction between federal and state law and which controls, he now \nknows that marijuana purchase, possession, and use is illegal. He credibly testified that \nhe will not use illegal drugs in the future and provided a negative drug test to \ncorroborate his discontinued use. He provided a signed statement of intent to abstain \nfrom all drug involvement and substance misuse. \nApplicant acknowledged that he made mistakes by being involved with \nmarijuana, but those mistakes were partially mitigated by the contradiction between \nstate and federal law. He understands that he is no longer in college, and he must \nconcentrate on his career, where he cannot be involved with illegal drugs. He credibly \ntestified that he no longer associates with anyone involved with illegal drugs. For these \nreasons, I find that his drug involvement and substance misuse is unlikely to recur, and \nhe has provided a sufficient pattern of abstinence. AG \u00b6 26(a) and AG \u00b6 26(b) fully \napply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.

Meyer, Esq. \n03/19/2024 \nDecision \nGARCIA, Candace Le\u2019i, Administrative Judge: \nApplicant did not mitigate the financial considerations security concerns. Eligibility \nfor access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn March 17, 2023, the Department of Defense (DoD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline F (financial \nconsiderations). The action was taken under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) \nimplemented by DoD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant responded to the SOR (Answer) on April 3, 2023, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on November 7, \n2023. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice on November \n16, 2023, scheduling the matter for a video conference hearing on December 6, 2023. \nI convened the hearing as scheduled. At the hearing, I admitted Government \nExhibits (GE) 1 through 3 without objection. Applicant testified and submitted Applicant \nExhibits (AE) A and B. I admitted AE A in evidence without objection. I overruled \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s objection to AE B and admitted it in evidence. At Applicant\u2019s \nrequest, I kept the record open until January 3, 2024, to enable him to submit additional \ndocumentation. He timely submitted documents, which I marked collectively as AE C and \nadmitted without objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on December 18, \n2023. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted all the SOR allegations. He is 58 years old. He was previously \nmarried four times: he married in 1983 and divorced in 1990; he remarried in 1994 and \ndivorced in 2005; he remarried in 2005 and divorced in 2012; and he remarried in 2011 \nand divorced in 2021. He married his fourth spouse, a native-born citizen of Kyrgyzstan, \nin Kyrgyzstan. He has six children, ages 39, 36, 33, 28, 24, and 11; his 11-year-old was \nborn from his most recent marriage. He has resided overseas, in an apartment provided \nby his employer, since approximately October 2016. (Tr. 18-19, 31-32, 34, 36, 39; GE 1; \nAE A) \nApplicant earned an associate degree. He has worked for various defense \ncontractors since approximately March 2001, to include at overseas locations beginning \nin March 2008. He has worked overseas as a team lead for his current employer since \nDecember 2019. He was granted a security clearance in approximately 2010. (Tr. 5, 18; \nGE 1; AE A) \nThe SOR alleged Applicant had nine delinquent consumer debts totaling $40,224. \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-i) The SOR allegations are established by his admissions in his Answer; his \nMay 2022 security clearance application (SCA); his October 2022 interview with an \nauthorized DoD background investigator; and a June 2022 credit bureau report (CBR). \n(GE 1-3) \nApplicant attributes his delinquent debts to minimal income, his ex-spouse\u2019s \nmismanagement of their finances, and his divorce. Applicant was the primary \nbreadwinner during his last marriage. Shortly after marrying his last spouse, he borrowed \n$30,000 from his 401(k)-retirement savings plan to pay for ear surgery she required to \ntreat a hearing impairment. He also paid to sponsor her move from Kyrgyzstan to the \nUnited States. When their child was born, he borrowed $15,000 from his 401(k)-\nretirement savings plan to purchase a family car, essentially depleting his 401(k). (Tr. 22-\n25, 27, 30-35, 37-40, 42, 75-76; GE 1-2; AE A-C) \nIn around 2015 or 2016, Applicant started a food truck business. His ex-spouse \nwas the cook and it was a way for her to earn money. He incurred debt to do so because \nshe could not obtain credit since she was not yet a U.S. citizen. The business did not do \nwell, as they made only enough to pay the minimal amount due on their expenses, and \nthey shut it down in 2017. They were struggling financially, so he elected to work overseas \nbecause it offered him the opportunity to earn a per diem in addition to a salary, which he \nintended to use to resolve his debts. He understood the debts were in his name, but he \nrelied on her, from 2017 to 2019, to pay them since his money was deposited into their \njoint bank account and she was managing their finances. He did not have his mail \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nforwarded to his overseas address and he had limited access to his accounts due to his \nemployer\u2019s restrictions on the websites he could access while working overseas. (Tr. 22-\n25, 27, 30-35, 37-40, 42, 44-61, 72, 76-82; GE 1-2; AE A-C) \nIn 2019, Applicant\u2019s employer ceased paying his per diem and his child was \ndiagnosed with dyslexia. He obtained a loan to pay for his child\u2019s special education \nschool, from 2018 to 2021, at a cost of $900 monthly. He also incurred expenses for his \nthen-spouse and child to relocate to a city closer to his child\u2019s school. He began to learn \nof his delinquent debts in 2020, through the security clearance process, and he attempted \nto reach his creditors. His efforts were thwarted by his inability to access their websites, \ndue to his employer\u2019s restrictions. He spoke with a debt consolidation company who \nadvised him to wait for his debts to fall off his CBR rather than initiating payments to \nresolve them. He elected to follow the company\u2019s advice. (Tr. 19-20, 22-25, 27, 30-35, \n37-40, 42, 50, 54-57, 61, 65-68, 72-82; GE 1-2; AE A-C) \nWhen Applicant and his ex-spouse divorced in 2021, he was ordered to pay $1,000 \nin child support, via wage garnishment beginning February 2022; he was assigned \nresponsibility for the debts from the marriage because they were incurred in his name; \nand he continued to financially support his ex-spouse until she remarried in 2022. He \nstated that he disputed the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d in July 2022 because he was not credited \nfor payments he made. He also paid an auto loan not alleged in the SOR, through monthly \npayments of $345, in October 2022. He stated that when he attempted to dispute some \nof his other debts, for the same reason he disputed SOR \u00b6 1.d, the debts had already \nfallen off his CBR. He stated that the SOR debts are no longer reported on his CBRs, and \nhe provided excerpts of CBRs from November 2023 as well as CBRs from December \n2023 to corroborate his claim. (Tr. 19-20, 22-25, 27, 30-35, 37-40, 42, 50, 54-57, 61, 65-\n68, 72-82; GE 1-2; AE A-C) \nSOR \u00b6 1.a is a $11,643 charged-off loan that Applicant obtained to pay for his 11\u00ad\nyear-old\u2019s dental expenses. He stated that he paid this debt for approximately one year, \nand then he chose to follow the advice given to him by the debt consolidation company \nand let it fall off his CBR. (Tr. 19-21, 33, 35-37, 62-66; GE 1-3) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b is a loan in collection for $10,180. Applicant obtained this loan to use \nas a down payment for a pickup truck and to purchase equipment for his food truck. He \nlet this debt fall off his CBR. (Tr. 21-22, 62-63, 66-68; GE 1-3) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c is a $8,980 charged-off loan. Applicant obtained this loan to purchase \nthe trailer that he turned into a food truck. He let this debt fall off his CBR. (Tr. 22-23, 68-\n69; GE 2-3) \nSOR \u00b6 1.d is a loan in collection for $4,267. Applicant obtained this loan to \npurchase a high-end stove for his food truck. He stated that he made monthly payments \nof $225 until approximately 2017, when he could no longer afford to do so. He also stated \nthat he settled this debt for $2,794, which he arranged to pay at $200 monthly through \nautomatic deductions from his bank account. He stated that he contacted the creditor \nthrough Credit Karma and disputed this debt in July 2022 when he realized that he was \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nnot credited for payments he made to this account. He stated that the debt dropped off \nhis CBR at the same time he received notification that his dispute was finalized. He did \nnot provide documentation to corroborate his payments or dispute. (Tr. 23, 38-40, 69-71; \nGE 1-3) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.f are debts in collection with the same company, for $2,794 and \n$1,011, respectively. Applicant believed both debts were loans he obtained to purchase \nequipment for his food truck. He stated that he paid them for an unspecified period and \nthen he let them fall off his CBR. (Tr. 25-26, 71; GE 1-3) \nSOR \u00b6 1.g is a $673 charged-off credit card. Applicant used this credit card for his \nfood-truck-related expenses. He made payments on the card until he stopped receiving \nper diem in 2019. He let this debt fall off his CBR. (Tr. 26-27, 71; GE 2-3) \nSOR \u00b6 1.h is a cash loan in collection for $560. Applicant obtained this loan in \napproximately 2016 to pay for food-truck-related expenses and his child\u2019s birthday gift. \nHe stated that this debt is no longer reported on his CBR. (Tr. 27, 71-72; GE 2-3) \nSOR \u00b6 1.i is a $116 charged-off electric bill. Applicant forgot to pay this debt. He \nstated that the debt is no longer reported on his CBR but he intends to contact the creditor \nto pay it if it is still outstanding. (Tr. 27, 72; GE 2-3) \nIn 2017, Applicant earned approximately $45,000 annually before he started \nworking overseas. Between 2017 and 2019, he earned approximately $75,000 to $80,000 \nwith per diem, and he earned $45,000 annually in 2019 without per diem. As of the date \nof the hearing, he earned approximately $40,000 annually, or $3,200 monthly. He \nexpected to begin earning $505 weekly in per diem beginning January 2024. He provided \na monthly budget, which reflects a monthly net remainder of $1,000. His housing \nexpenses are paid by his employer and he does not have any expenses related to his \nhome address in the United States, which is with his mother. Since 2022, he has paid \n$450 monthly for online special education classes for his child. His assets totaled \napproximately $32,000, which included $8000 in savings, a car valued at $12,000, and a \ntrailer valued at $12,000. He is saving money to buy a home for him and his child. He has \nnot incurred any new delinquent debts. He utilizes Credit Karma to monitor his credit but \nhe has not received credit counseling. He intends to maintain control over his finances. \n(Tr. 28-30, 32-33, 37-50, 75-78, 82; GE 2; AE A-C) \nApplicant provided numerous letters of support from a former supervisor, longtime \ncolleagues, some of whom he previously supervised, and friends. Aware of Applicant\u2019s \nfinancial delinquencies, all these individuals attested to his judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. Appellant\u2019s former supervisor noted that Appellant earned at least two \nachievement awards between 2007 and 2010. Appellant\u2019s performance was favorably \nrated from January 2023 to December 2023. (Tr. 43; AE A, C) \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of Exec. Or. \n10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall \nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also \nExec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or \nsensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \n5 \n\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . .. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of not paying his debts. He has also chosen to allow his \ndebts to fall off his CBRs, despite his ability to pay them. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(c), 19(b), and 19(c) \nare established. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConditions beyond Applicant\u2019s control contributed to his debts. The first prong of \nAG \u00b6 20(b) applies. For the full application of AG \u00b6 20(b), he must provide evidence that \nhe acted responsibly under his circumstances. Applicant has chosen to allow his debts to \nfall off his CBRs, despite his ability to pay them. Merely waiting for a debt to drop off a \ncredit report by the passage of time is not a factor in an applicant\u2019s favor, and the fact that \nsome debts have dropped off an applicant\u2019s credit report is not meaningful evidence of \ndebt resolution. See, e.g, ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Jun. 4, 2001); ISCR \nCase No. 14-05803 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 7, 2016). In addition, Applicant did not provide \ndocumentation to corroborate any of his claims of payment or dispute. He has not \nreceived financial counseling. He needs more time to establish that he has his finances \nunder control. I find that these financial issues continue to cast doubt on his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), 20(d), and 20(e) do not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-\nperson analysis. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude that Applicant has \nnot mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.i: \nAgainst Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nCandace Le\u2019i Garcia \nAdministrative Judge \n8 \n",

At the hearing, Department Counsel amended the SOR adding allegation \n\u00b6 1.d, which reads as follows: \nYou falsified material facts on an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP), executed by you on or about August 4, \n2022, in response to Section 23, Illegal Use of Drugs or Drug Activity. In \nthe last seven (7) years, have you illegally used any drugs or controlled \nsubstances, use of a drug or controlled substance, including injecting, \nsnorting, inhaling, swallowing, experimenting with or otherwise consuming \nany drug or controlled substance? You answered \u201cNo\u201d and, thereby, \ndeliberately failed to disclose that you, in fact, used marijuana in June of \n2022. (TR at page 39 line 3 to page 41 line 13.)  \nApplicant neither admitted or denied this additional allegation; and as such, I \nconsider it denied. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and \ntestimony, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 22-year-old employee of a \ndefense contractor. He has been employed with the defense contractor since July of \n2022. Applicant has a high school diploma. He is unmarried, and has no children. (GX 1 \nat pages 5, 8~9, 10 and 17.) \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct \n1.a. In about February 2022, Applicant was terminated from his previous \nemployment for employee theft of merchandise. He admits he was terminated, but \navers he felt pressure to sign a statement of guilt because he knew of the theft by his \nfellow employees. Applicant claims that this was only guilt by association. (TR at page \n18 line 9 to page 25 line 21.) This claim is not believable. \n1.b. Applicant admits that he used marijuana on \u201cone occasion\u201d in June 2022. \n(TR at page 33 line 13 to page 35 line 6.) \n1.c. Applicant answered \u201cNo,\u201d in his response to Interrogatories dated March 25, \n2023, as to past marijuana use. (GX 2 at page 7.) As Applicant already admitted this \none-time usage during an Enhanced Subject Interview in October 2022 (GX 2 at page \n4), he \u201cthought the question referred to EVER using a substance other then [sic] the one \ntime admitted use.\u201d (TR at page 28 line 24 to page 37 line 19, and Answer.) This \nallegation is found for Applicant. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n1.d. Applicant answered \u201cNo\u201d to Section 23 on his August 2022 e-QIP as to past \nillegal use of drugs in the last seven years. (GX 1 at page 24.) As he used marijuana \ntwo months earlier in June 2022, noted above, this was willful falsification. This \nallegation is found against Applicant. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who applies for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall \nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \nAnalysis \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result \nin an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security \nclearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national security \neligibility: \n(c) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo \nor cooperate with security processing, including but not \nlimited to meeting with a security investigator for subject \ninterview, completing security forms or releases, cooperation \nwith medical or psychological evaluation, or polygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to \nlawful questions of investigators, security officials, or other \nofficial representatives in connection with a personnel \nsecurity or trustworthiness determination. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 16. Two are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nApplicant was terminated from his employment in February 2022 for \nmalfeasance, used marijuana in June of 2022, and falsified his e-QIP in August 2022. \nThe evidence is sufficient to raise these disqualifying conditions. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 including: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability. \nNone of these apply. Applicant did not make a good-faith effort to correct his e-\nQIP falsification. Personal Conduct is found against Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nGuideline E in my whole-person analysis. Applicant is respected in his community.\n(AppX A.) \n \nOverall, however, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the Personal Conduct security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. and 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nRichard A.

However, he included a narrative statement in which he denied any deliberate attempt to conceal information. I read his statement as applying to all three of the Guideline E allegations, so I consider that he denied each of them. His admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. Additional findings follow. Applicant is a 25-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has never married, and he has no children. He has a high school diploma and an associate degree. He is currently pursuing a bachelor\u2019s degree. He enlisted in the Army at age 17, in June 2017. He served for four years, until he was administratively discharged.

His answer is undated \nand it was not clear whether or not he requested a hearing before an administrative \njudge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). However, DOHA \nprocessed the case as a request for a hearing, and the case was assigned to me on \nAugust 29, 2023. The case was initially scheduled for October 31, 2023, but was \nrescheduled by mutual agreement due to a DOHA scheduling conflict.

At the start of the proceeding, \nApplicant confirmed that he had requested a hearing. (Tr. 4) Department Counsel \noffered Government\u2019s Exhibits (GE) 1 and 2, which I admitted without objection. During \nthe hearing, Department Counsel produced and offered GE 3, a 2017 SCA prepared by \nApplicant. GE 3 was admitted only for purposes of rebuttal. Applicant testified and \noffered Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through E, all of which were admitted without \nobjection. \nAt the end of the hearing, I held the record open to provide Applicant the \nopportunity to submit additional documents. Later the same day, he submitted an e-mail \n(AE F) and several other documents (AE G through AE N) for consideration. These \ndocuments are discussed in the Facts section, below.

DOHA received the \nhearing transcript (Tr.) on November 15, 2023. \nFindings of Fact  \nApplicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 2.a under Guidelines H and J. Under \nGuideline E, he \u201cadmitted\u201d SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a and 3.b, and he denied SOR \u00b6 3.c. However, he \nincluded a narrative statement in which he denied any deliberate attempt to conceal \ninformation. I read his statement as applying to all three of the Guideline E allegations, \nso I consider that he denied each of them. His admissions are incorporated into the \nfindings of fact. Additional findings follow.  \nApplicant is a 25-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has never \nmarried, and he has no children. He has a high school diploma and an associate \ndegree. He is currently pursuing a bachelor\u2019s degree. He enlisted in the Army at age 17, \nin June 2017. He served for four years, until he was administratively discharged. (GE 1; \nTr. 27-28, 33) \nIn October 2020, Applicant used marijuana one time while he was stationed at \nFort X in State 1 as a supply sergeant (E-5) in the Army.

He later took a random drug test and tested positive for \ntetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the active ingredient in marijuana. (SOR \u00b6 1.b) He knew \nwhat he did was illegal, was not allowed while he held a clearance, and that he should \nnot have done it. (Tr. 24, 40) He acknowledged that he had access to classified \ndocuments while in the Army. (Tr. 21-23, 34-36) It is not clear from the record, however, \nwhether or not he had been \u201cgranted access to classified information\u201d at the time, as \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. \nApplicant was subsequently charged under the UCMJ with violating Article 112a, \nwrongful possession, distribution, and introduction of a controlled substance. In January \n2021, he had an Article 15 hearing before his battalion commander, and he was found \nto have violated UCMJ Article 112a for wrongful use of THC, a controlled substance. He \nwas reduced in rank to E-4 (specialist), forfeited $1,291 in pay for two months, placed \non extra duty and restriction for 45 days, and given an oral reprimand. (SOR \u00b6 2.a) (Tr. \n25-27, 31-41) \nApplicant was also told that he had to pass an alcohol and drug abuse prevention \ntraining (ADAPT) if he was to remain in the Army. Along with the ADAPT classes, he \nparticipated in counseling from April 2021 to August 2021. (AE A) He learned about the \nconsequences of illegal drug use. (Tr. 38-39) He feels misled because he took drug \ntests every two weeks and passed the ADAPT class but was ultimately told he was not \nbeing retained by the Army. He was administratively separated in August 2021, with a \ngeneral discharge under honorable conditions. (Tr. 25-27, 31-41; GE 1; AE A) \nApplicant testified that before the drug test, he had been having problems in his \ncommand with the way he was being trained. He raised his concerns with superiors, \nnoting that he worked longer hours than many others in his unit and dealt with fatigue. \nHe was often the only supply clerk on duty. The unit had just returned from Korea (June \n2019-March 2020) and he was overworked. He asserted that this stress and fatigue was \nwhat led him to use the marijuana. He no longer feels \u201cmicro-managed\u201d and demeaned \nin his current job as he did in the Army. Applicant testified that he \u201cmade a big mistake \nand messed up my career. I understand that.\u201d (Tr. 19-20, 23, 31, 36-37) \nApplicant filled out an SCA in April 2022 in connection with his current job. In \nanswering questions under Section 23 \u2013 Illegal Use of Drugs or Drug activity, he failed \nto disclose his use of marijuana in October 2020, both in answer to a question asking \nfor disclosure of any illegal drug use in the last seven years and in answer to a separate \nquestion asking, \u201cHave you EVER illegally used or been illegally involved with a drug or \ncontrolled substance while possessing a security clearance other than previously \nlisted?\u201d (GE 1 at 23) (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a, 3.b) When asked why he did not disclose his drug \nuse on his 2022 SCA, Applicant said, \u201cI have no reason for that\u201d and \u201cno excuse.\u201d (Tr. \n29, 43) He acknowledged completing the April 2022 SCA and certifying its accuracy, \nunder penalty of 18 USC \u00b6 1001, a federal criminal offense.

(Tr. 43, 44-46, 50) \nApplicant also failed to disclose his UCMJ charge, and the fact that the charge \ninvolved a drug offense, in answer to certain questions on his SCA about his police \nrecord. (GE 1 at 22-23). This omission was not alleged in the SOR. He testified that he \ndid not list it on his SCA because he thought it was \u201call connected\u201d to his discharge and \ndrug use. (Tr. 30, 44-46) \nApplicant also failed to disclose his illegal drug use during his background \ninterview in November 2022. He initially affirmed his negative answer about prior drug \nuse on GE 1. During his background interview, he initially only acknowledged using \nmarijuana in high school between August 2015 and June 2017. He first denied using \nmarijuana at any time after 2017, and he initially denied using marijuana in the Army. \n(GE 2 at 6; Tr. 51-52) He denied having disciplinary issues at work. He denied having \nbeen charged under the UCMJ. (GE 2 at 4-5) \nApplicant was asked at the completion of interview questioning whether he had \nupdated all his information (on his SCA) correctly and truthfully. He answered, \u201cYes,\u201d \nbut nonetheless failed to disclose either his marijuana use while in the Army, or the fact \nthat it led to charges under the UCMJ. (GE 2) (SOR \u00b6 3.c) At the end of the interview, \nhe said he denied his prior issues in the Army because he wanted to put them behind \nhim and did not want to talk about it. (GE 2 at 8) He acknowledged that he did not come \nclean about his drug use during his interview until he was confronted about it. He \nacknowledged having been given multiple chances during the interview to do so. (Tr. \n30-31, 47-49, 51-53) Applicant adopted the summary of his background interview as \naccurate in an interrogatory response in May 2023. (GE 2) \nApplicant completed an earlier SCA in June 2017, when he first joined the Army, \nso he was familiar with the questions on the form. (Tr. 43) He acknowledged that he \nshould have disclosed his earlier, high-school era marijuana use on both his 2017 SCA \nand the 2022 SCA. (GE 1-3;Tr. 45-46) During the hearing, Government Counsel offered \nthe 2017 SCA (GE 3) as a rebuttal exhibit, and it was admitted for that limited purpose. \n(Tr. 58-63) \nAfter leaving the Army, Applicant struggled to find employment, in part because \nhis DD-214 discharge paperwork references \u201cdrug abuse.\u201d Federal jobs also require a \ndrug test. He believes his prior clearance in the Army (granted after the 2017 SCA) \ncarried over and remained active. (Tr. 27-29) \nApplicant said he has not used marijuana since October 2020. He has had no \nsubsequent criminal charges or citations. He took drug tests every two weeks, as \nrequired, for a year. He takes random drug tests for his job, and last took one about a \nyear before the hearing. He now lives in another state, and no longer associates with \nanyone he knew when he was stationed at Fort X. He has not been around anyone \nusing marijuana since he was in the Army.

(Tr. 31-35, 53-55) \nPrior to testing positive for marijuana, Applicant received funds in preparation for \na move to another duty station and received money so he could do that. He is required \nto pay it back since he left the Army before he transferred duty stations. He owes the \ngovernment about $5,200 and, since October 2023, he has been on a repayment plan \nof $173 a month. (Tr. 56-57) \nApplicant provided several letters of reference from fellow non-commissioned \nofficers (NCOs) in his unit, written in July 2021, likely in connection with his \nadministrative separation proceeding. They support his assertions that he had been \nunder stress at the time of his marijuana use and his belief that his unit\u2019s leadership had \nfailed him. His references asked that he be given a second chance. (AE B \u2013 AE E) \nApplicant provided several news articles about leadership problems at Fort X \nwhen he was there, some of which were widely publicized in the national media. (AE G \n\u2013 AE N) He acknowledged, however, that these incidents were not the reason for his \nfailed drug test. He closed by accepting responsibility for his actions. He requested a \nchance to regain his professional reputation and serve the country. (AE F; Tr. 54) \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court has held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on \nmere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement \nAG \u00b6 24 details the security concern for drug involvement: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription drugs, and the use of other substances that can cause \nphysical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with \ntheir intended use can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness, both because such behavior may lead to physical or \npsychological impairment and because it raises questions about a \nperson\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nControlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as defined in 21 \nU.S.C 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in this guideline \nto describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nI have considered the disqualifying conditions for drug involvement under AG \u00b6 \n25 and the following are potentially applicable: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition);  \n(b) testing positive for an illegal drug; \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nWhile in the Army, Applicant used marijuana one time, in edible form, in October \n2020, when he was out at a bar off base with friends. He held a clearance and was \u201cin a \nsensitive position, but it is not established that he had actually been granted access to \nclassified information at the time. He later tested positive for THC and was charged with \ndrug-related offenses under the UCMJ. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), 25(b), and 25(c) all apply. AG \u00b6 \n25(f) applies, but only because he was in the Army at the time and was therefore \n\u201cholding a sensitive position.\u201d (Applicant\u2019s earlier marijuana use in high school is not \nalleged). \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) \nchanging or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) \nproviding a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement \nand substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \nApplicant used marijuana one time, in October 2020, now more than three years \nago. He paid a heavy price, since his actions led to an Article 15 hearing and his \nadministrative separation from the Army. He took and completed an ADAPT class. \nThere is no indication of subsequent illegal drug use or involvement, and he has \ndisassociated himself from the friends from his Army service with whom he used the \nmarijuana. AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b) both apply, and drug involvement security concerns \nare mitigated. \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct  \nAG \u00b6 30 details the security concern for criminal conduct: \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nApplicant\u2019s drug use and positive drug test led to an Article 15 hearing under the \nUCMJ, which resulted in reduction of rank, restricted duty, and a loss in pay, as well as, \nultimately, his separation from the Army. AG \u00b6 31(b) applies. \nAG \u00b6 32 sets forth the potentially applicable mitigating conditions: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and  \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nGiven the isolated nature of the incident and the fact that it occurred more than \nthree years ago, AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and 32(d) warrant consideration for the same reasons as \nset forth under Guideline H, above. However, there is the additional matter of the fact \nthat Applicant lied on his SCA and in his background interview, as discussed under \nGuideline E, below. His deliberate falsifications constitute additional, subsequent \ncriminal conduct (since he violated 18 USC \u00b6 1001), that undercuts any mitigation that \nmight have otherwise been shown. Neither mitigating condition therefore fully applies, \nand criminal conduct security concerns are not mitigated. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 details the security concerns for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information.

The following will normally \nresult in an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security \nclearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national security \neligibility: \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or cooperate \nwith security processing, including but not limited to meeting with a \nsecurity investigator for subject interview, completing security forms or \nreleases, cooperation with medical or psychological evaluation, or \npolygraph examination, if authorized and required; and \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful questions of \ninvestigators, security officials, or other official representatives in \nconnection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination. \nI considered the following disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 16: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and  \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, \ninvestigator, security official, competent medical or mental health \nprofessional involved in making a recommendation relevant to a national \nsecurity \neligibility \ndetermination, \nor \nother \nofficial \ngovernment \nrepresentative. \nThe SOR alleges that when he submitted his April 2022 SCA, Applicant \ndeliberately failed to disclose both his use of marijuana in October 2020 and the fact \nthat his use occurred while he possessed a clearance (which it did, even if he did not \nhave actual access to classified information at the time). The SOR also alleges that \nApplicant deliberately failed to disclose his drug use during his background interview \nsoon thereafter. \nApplicant asserted that he did not intend to mislead the government or to give \nfalse information. His assertions are simply not credible. He repeatedly offered \u201cno \nexcuse\u201d for his omissions. He had ample opportunities to disclose his drug use to the \nGovernment, both on the SCA and in his interview, yet he persistently denied his \nactions. He even made several affirmatively false statements during the interview. He \ninitially affirmed his negative responses in his SCA to any history of drug use. Then, on \nfurther questioning, he only acknowledged using marijuana in high school, between \nAugust 2015 and June 2017 and denied any additional marijuana use, including any \nuse in the Army. He denied having disciplinary issues at work. He denied having been \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncharged under the UCMJ. Applicant\u2019s repeated false statements on his SCA and in his \ninterview satisfy AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) and 16(b). \nAG \u00b6 17 sets forth the following potentially applicable mitigating conditions under \nGuideline E: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and  \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \nNeither mitigating condition applies. Applicant did not disclose his use of \nillegal drugs, his positive drug test, or his UCMJ charges, until he was confronted \nduring his background interview. Indeed, as noted above, he made multiple false \nstatements about his drug use during his interview. I cannot conclude that his lack \nof candor is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment. Neither AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(a) nor 17(c) applies to mitigate his repeated \nfalse statements during the security clearance process. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines H, J, and E in my whole-person analysis. Overall, the record evidence \nleaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2: Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 3.a-3.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security to grant Applicant a security clearance.

Administrative Judge \nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, \nApplicant did not mitigate financial consideration concerns. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information or to hold a sensitive position is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn March 28, 2023, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency \n(DCSA) Consolidated Central Adjudications Service (CAS) issued a statement of \nreasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing reasons why under the financial considerations \nguideline the DCSA CAS could not make the preliminary affirmative determination of \neligibility for granting a security clearance, and recommended referral to an \nadministrative judge to determine whether a security clearance should be granted, \ncontinued, denied, or revoked. The action was taken under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960); \nDepartment of Defense (DoD) Directive 5220.6 Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program, (January 2, 1992) (Directive); and Security Executive \nAgent Directive 4, establishing in Appendix A the National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to \nHold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective June 8, 2017. \n1 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on June 13, 2023, and requested that his case \nbe resolved on the written record without a hearing.

The \nGovernment\u2019s exhibits were admitted as Items 1-5. \nSummary of Pleadings \nUnder Guideline F, Applicant allegedly (a) failed to file his federal and state A tax \nincome tax returns, as required, for tax years 2017 through 2021; (b) failed to file his \nstate B come tax returns, as required; for tax years 2019 through 2021; and (c) \naccumulated three delinquent consumer debts exceeding $1,500. Allegedly, Applicant\u2019s \ndelinquent debts have not been resolved and remain outstanding. \nUnder Guideline H, Applicant allegedly used marijuana with varying frequency \nfrom about June 2013 until at least March 2022. Allegedly, he used marijuana in \nviolation of 21 U. S.C. \u00a7 802. \nIn Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, he admitted all of the allegations with \nexplanations. He claimed he did not know how to file his past tax returns and needed to \ncontact the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to \u201cget paperwork to file\u201d both his federal \nand state unfiled returns. He claimed, too, that he planned to file his tax returns in 2023 \nand determine how much he owes in back taxes. He further claimed that he was in the \nprocess of saving to pay off his listed SOR debts. Addressing the tax-filing allegations of \nSOR \u00b6 1.c, Applicant claimed that State B had no federal tax law in the state and that \nhe did not know how to go about filing tax returns in State B. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 29-year-old employee of a defense contractor who seeks a security \nclearance.

(Items 2-5) While he did not file \nState B income tax returns for tax years 2019-2021, State B reportedly does not have \nstate income tax-filing requirements for the years in issue. And, without a state income \ntax, state tax returns would not be required of State B residents. \nApplicant attributed his federal and State A tax-filing lapses to his lack of federal \nand state tax forms for tax years 2017-2021 and time conflicts with scheduling \nappointments with a \u201clive agent.\u201d (Item 3) \nPressed further by an agent of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) in an \nensuing November 2022 personal subject interview (PSI) about his tax-filing lapses, \nApplicant told the investigator only that he was unable to file his federal and state tax \nreturns for tax years 2017-2021 with his Turbo tax app. (Item 4) \nApplicant added that he owed the IRS approximately $11,000 in back taxes. \n(Item 4) Whether he ever filed federal and State A tax returns and paid any taxes owed \nfor the specified years in question is not documented by Applicant and cannot be \ncredited to him without verification. \nBesides his tax-filing lapses, Applicant accumulated three delinquent accounts \nexceeding $1,500. (Items 3-5) The individual amounts of the debts are relatively small \n(none exceeding $680), and most of them, according to Applicant, have been removed \nfrom his credit report. (Items 3-5). Still, Applicant, to date, has not addressed them in \nany tangible way. \nAfforded an opportunity to supplement the FORM with updates about the status \nof his federal and state tax return filing status and payments and delinquent consumer \naccounts, Applicant did not provide any additional evidence or information.

Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe AGs list guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision-making \nprocess covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that could \ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as \nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. These guidelines include conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of \nthe conditions that could mitigate security concerns, if any. These guidelines must be \nconsidered before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, \ncontinued, or denied. Although, the guidelines do not require judges to place exclusive \nreliance on the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the guidelines in \narriving at a decision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context \nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for \n4 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n             \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n      \n \n           \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n                                                   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \nFinancial Considerations \nThe Concern: \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, \nsatisfy debts and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, \nlack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules or regulations, all of \nwhich can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness \nand ability to protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress \ncan also be caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible \nindicator of other issues of personnel security concern such as excessive \ngambling, mental health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse \nor dependence. An individual who is financially overextended is at greater \nrisk of having to engage in illegal acts or otherwise questionable acts to \ngenerate funds. . . . AG \u00b6 18. \nDrug Involvement \nThe Concern: The illegal use of controlled substances, to include \nthe misuse of prescription drugs, and the use of other substances that \ncause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, \nrules, and regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled \nsubstance\u201d as defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic \nterm adopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed \nabove. AG \u00b6 24. \nBurdens of Proof \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. \nDecisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant \nmay deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such decisions \nentail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, rather than \nactual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7.

Applicant\u2019s filing lapses and accumulated delinquent accounts raise \ntrust, reliability, and judgment concerns about his current and future ability to manage \nher finances safely and responsibly. Security concerns are raised as well over \nApplicant\u2019s use of marijuana over an eight-year period spanning June 2013 through at \nleast March 2022. \nFinancial concerns \nApplicant\u2019s multiple tax-filing lapses and accumulated delinquent debts warrant \nthe application of three of the disqualifying conditions (DC) of the financial consideration \nguidelines. DC \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), inability to satisfy debts\u201d; 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations\u201d; and 19(f), \u201cfailure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, \nor local income tax returns, or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax \nas required,\u201d apply to Applicant\u2019s situation.

While the principal concern of a \nsecurity clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated difficulties is vulnerability to coercion and \ninfluence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in cases involving delinquent debts. \nHistorically, the timing of addressing and resolving tax-filing and payment \ndelinquencies (both tax-related and other debts) are critical to an assessment of an \napplicant\u2019s trustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment in following rules and \nguidelines necessary for those seeking access to classified information or to holding a \nsensitive position.

Both areas of concern have been addressed in development of the \nfactual record in this case. Only one of the state tax regimes considered has a tax-filing \nrequirement (State A), and for that reason the tax-filing allegations covered by SOR \n\u00b61.c require no in-depth discussion of Applicant\u2019s failure to file his state income tax \nreturns in State B. \nWhile Applicant is entitled to credit for his work in the defense industry, his efforts \nare not enough at this time to overcome his repeated failures or inability to address his \ntax-filing and payment responsibilities in a timely way over the course of many years. \nTrust concerns are compounded by Applicant\u2019s lengthy history of marijuana use. Overall \ntrustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment have not been established. \nBased on a consideration of all of the facts and circumstances considered in this \ncase, it is too soon to make safe predictions that Applicant will be able to undertake \nreasoned, good-faith efforts to mitigate the Government\u2019s financial and drug \ninvolvement concerns within the foreseeable future. More time is needed for him to \nestablish the requisite levels of stability with his finances and committed avoidance of \nillegal drugs to establish his overall eligibility for holding a security clearance. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v.

His Answer did not provide any information about \nhis efforts to resolve these delinquent debts, and he did not include any documentary \nevidence with his Answer. He requested a hearing before a Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge. \nOn November 3, 2023, a notice of hearing was issued, scheduling the hearing for \nNovember 14, 2023, via a video-teleconferencing application.

He enlisted in the U.S. Coast Guard in August 1997, and \nserved on active duty until September 2001, when he went into the reserves. He was \nhonorably discharged in May 2002.

Since October 2008 he is employed full time \nas an IT support employee with a DOD contractor. He was married in 2002 and divorced \nin February 2020. He has three children, ages 21, 16 and 11. He has full custody of his \n16-year-old son, and primary custody of his 11-year-old daughter. He does not pay child \nsupport to his ex-wife. (GE 1; GE 2; Tr. 18-23, 34, 47; GE 1) \nFinancial Considerations \nThe March 2023 SOR alleges seven delinquent accounts totaling $54,568; of \nwhich four are credit-card accounts, totaling $54,179 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d); an unpaid cable \nbill for $228 (SOR \u00b6 1.e); and two delinquent medical accounts totaling $161 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f \nand 1.g). According to a credit bureau report dated February 14, 2024, the balances for \nthe four delinquent credit cards remained unchanged and were charged-off in the total \namount of $54,179. (SOR; GE 4; Tr. 59-61) \nApplicant attributes his financial problems to his now ex-wife\u2019s uncontrollable \nspending during their marriage, and the legal expenses associated with heir divorce in \nFebruary 2020.

It got to the point that he no longer questioned her \nabout her spending because he knew it would turn into a nasty argument. The four credit \ncard accounts alleged in the SOR became delinquent in 2019 or 2020, following his filing \nfor divorce. (Tr. 18, 24-27, 32) \nApplicant\u2019s lawyer\u2019s fees for the divorce and custody of his children totaled over \n$20,000. His wife moved out of their home, and he became responsible for the house \npayment and utilities on his own. He also had to pay child support for a period of time. \nDuring the divorce, his oldest daughter and son needed counseling which was expensive \nbut necessary. The divorce decree held him responsible for 68% of the marital debt, and \nhis wife was responsible for the remaining 32%. His father-in-law immediately paid his \ndaughter\u2019s marital debts. Applicant put the house up for sale, and he eventually broke \neven after paying off the mortgage and relator\u2019s fees. He now lives in an apartment. He \ncurrently earns an annual salary of $123,000, and he receives two paychecks a month \nwith a total net of approximately $6,800. Since he no longer has to pay for after school \nchildcare for his youngest child, he is now left with some money after paying his monthly \nexpenses, but it is nominal. (Tr. 28-36, 46-52) \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant is indebted in the total amount of $54,179, for four \ncredit card accounts that were charged-off due to nonpayment. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d) He \nadmitted these accounts and stated that he had tried working with the creditors to resolve \nthese debts, but these attempts were unsuccessful. He also hired a consumer debt \nservice in late 2020 or early 2021, but he was unable to continue with the program. He \nadmitted he was aware these delinquent debts could have a potential adverse impact on \nhis current security clearance. Since the SOR was issued March 28, 2023, he has failed \nto provide copies of communications with creditors or the arrangement of any payment \nplans. The debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d remain unresolved. (Tr. 37-43; GE 2, 4) \nSOR \u00b6 1.e alleges that Applicant is indebted to a cable company in the amount of \n$228, for an account referred for collection in 2022. Applicant testified that he had paid \nthis account, but he did not provide any supporting documentation while the record was \nheld open. The February 2024 credit report did not reflect this account, and as such, I find \nin favor of Applicant for resolving this debt. (Tr. 44-45; GE 2) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.g allege two medical accounts totaling $161, that were referred \nfor collection in 2022. Applicant testified that he had paid these medical accounts, but he \ndid not provide any receipts to support his claim. The current credit report does not reflect \nthese delinquent medical accounts. I find in favor of Applicant for resolving these \naccounts. (Tr. 44-45; GE 2) \nApplicant was provided the opportunity to submit a post-hearing personal financial \nstatement to provide better insight about his income and expenses. He did not submit a \nfinancial statement. He stated he received financial counseling after attending a \nretirement seminar.

Applicant admitted he paid off one credit card for \nless than the full value after the creditor became aggressive in their pursuit of payment. \nThis account was not alleged in the SOR. He submitted a post-hearing document which \nshowed that the creditor cancelled $3,358 of the debt and provided him with a 1099-C to \nfile with his 2022 income taxes. He did not provide any plans or documentary evidence \nof a debt-resolution proposal for the $54,179 of unresolved credit card debt as alleged in \nthe SOR. (AE A; Tr. 40-42, 53, 56- GE 3) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nConditions that may raise financial considerations security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe Government established that Applicant had seven delinquent accounts, \ntotaling approximately $54,568. The vast majority of the debt is attributed to four unpaid \ncredit card accounts that remain delinquent and unresolved. Applicant did not express a \nplan to repay this debt totaling $54,179. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant bears the burden of production and persuasion in mitigation.

Mar. 9, 2017). See, e.g., \nISCR Case No. 13-00987 at 3, n. 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 14, 2014). \nApplicant experienced financial difficulties due to his wife\u2019s excessive spending \nduring the marriage, and the legal costs associated with their February 2020 divorce. \nNotwithstanding these circumstances beyond his control, he did not establish that he \nacted responsibly to address his four remaining delinquent accounts totaling over \n$54,000. He failed to monitor his wife\u2019s control of the family expenses, and after he \nannounced his desire for a divorce, he neglected to ensure that the bills were being paid. \nHis total reliance on his spouse does not absolve him of his responsibility in maintaining \na workable household budget during their marriage. \nApplicant provided no evidence of communications he had with the creditors or \nsubmit documentation of his efforts to consolidate his SOR debts with a consumer credit \nagency. Despite gainful employment, there is no evidence that Applicant has made any \npayments on any of the four delinquent credit card debts. This does not show a good-\nfaith effort to resolve his debts. He did not provide a monthly budget showing his income \nand expenses, nor did he detail his financial counseling or discuss a reasonable plan to \nresolve these significant delinquent accounts. There is insufficient evidence to find that \nhis finances are under control. None of the financial considerations mitigating conditions \napply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_______________________ \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the adjudicative guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered \nthe potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline \nF and the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) in this whole-person analysis. \nNotwithstanding circumstances beyond his control, \nApplicant \nhas not \ndemonstrated that he acted responsibly to address and resolve his delinquent accounts \ntotaling over $54,000. Applicant failed to mitigate the financial considerations security \nconcerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.e-1.g: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, I conclude \nthat it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security for Applicant to have \na security clearance.

He started using marijuana \nin June 2022 because his prescription pain medication was not effectively managing his \npain. He typically ingested marijuana in edibles on a daily basis. He used marijuana daily \nfrom June 7, 2022 until early September 2022. He explained that he did not disclose his \nmarijuana use on his e-QIP because he did not understand that his marijuana use violated \nFederal laws. He expressed his intent to use marijuana, with his medical marijuana card, \nin the future if permitted by his employer. (GE 5) \nIn his May 18, 2023 response to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant confirmed that \nthe OPM summary reflected his admissions during the September 16, 2022 interview.

He listed that he last used marijuana in \u201clate \n2022.\u201d (GE 5) \nIn his June 13, 2023 Answer, Applicant admitted using marijuana from June 2022 \nuntil September 2022 (SOR \u00b6 1.a.). He further admitted that he had purchased marijuana \nfrom state-licensed dispensaries from June 2022 until August 29, 2022 (SOR \u00b6 1.b.). \n(Answer) \nIn his FORM Response, Applicant explained that he had obtained a medical \nmarijuana card to manage pain from a traumatic brain injury or other injuries that occurred \nin May 2022. A physician identified medical marijuana as a potential substance to prevent \nfuture strokes and seizures. Applicant admitted that he used marijuana from about 1988 \nto 1993 and again between 1996 and 2004. He then used marijuana occasionally, with \nhis then fianc\u00e9e beginning in 2019. At the time, his fianc\u00e9e had a medical marijuana card, \nbut Applicant was illegally using marijuana without a medical marijuana card. In his FORM \nResponse, Applicant explained that he no longer associates with either ex-spouse, who \nhad used marijuana in his presence, and that his father no longer uses marijuana. As to \nwhether he intended to use marijuana in the future, he responded that he did not \n\u201canticipate to have any plans to use marijuana.\u201d (FORM Response) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nsensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern for drug involvement is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 25. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \nMarijuana is a Schedule I controlled substance under Federal law pursuant to Title \n21, Section 812 of the United States Code. Schedule I drugs are those which have a high \npotential for abuse; have no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United \nStates; and lack accepted safety for use of the drug under medical supervision. Section \n844 under Title 21 of the United States Code makes it unlawful for any person to \nknowingly or intentionally possess a controlled substance not obtained pursuant to a valid \nprescription. \nOn October 25, 2014, the then Director of National Intelligence (DNI) issued \nguidance that changes to laws by some states and the District of Columbia to legalize or \ndecriminalize the recreational use of marijuana do not alter existing federal law or the \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines, and that an individual\u2019s disregard of federal \nlaw pertaining to the use, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains adjudicatively \nrelevant in national security eligibility determinations. \nMoreover, on December 21, 2021, the current DNI issued clarifying guidance \nconcerning marijuana, noting that prior recreational use of marijuana by an individual may \nbe relevant to security adjudications, but is not determinative in the whole-person \nevaluation. Relevant factors in mitigation include the frequency of use and whether the \nindividual can demonstrate that future use is unlikely to recur. \nApplicant\u2019s illegal use, possession, and purchase of marijuana spanned from about \n1993 to 1996, 1996 to 2004, and from 2019 until September 2022. He admitted daily use \nof marijuana between June 2022 and September 2022. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(c) apply. \nThe SOR did not allege that Applicant expressed an intent to use marijuana in the \nfuture or failed to convincingly commit to discontinue his marijuana use. Furthermore, the \nGovernment did not amend the SOR to raise such disqualifying conduct. Therefore, I am \nnot permitted to consider or apply AG \u00b6 25(g). \nConditions that could mitigate the drug involvement security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 26. The following are potentially applicable: \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand  \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nApplicant bears the burden of production and persuasion in mitigation. The DOHA \nAppeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability \nof mitigating conditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \n[Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988)], supra. \u201cAny \ndoubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified \ninformation will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d Directive, \nEnclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b). (ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 24, 2013)) \nApplicant used marijuana from about 1993 to 1996, from 1996 to 2004, and \nbetween 2019 and September 2022. He also was charged with a felony drug offense in \n2000. During his security interview, Applicant reported that he was using marijuana as \nfrequently as three times a week around the time of his 2000 arrest. He also initially \ndenied any drug arrests, despite the 2000 felony arrest and charge. Applicant did not \npossess a medical marijuana card when he used marijuana with his fianc\u00e9e beginning in \n2019. Any use by Applicant prior to obtaining a medical marijuana card in June 2022 \nviolated both Federal and state drug laws. Applicant has not adequately explained why \nhe did not report his pre-injury marijuana use (with his ex-wife between 2019 and March \n2022) or his felony drug arrest in his e-QIP. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFrom June 7, 2022 until at least September 2022, Applicant used marijuana on a \ndaily basis, while he held a medical marijuana card. During his Answer, Applicant \nexplained that he did not understand that his marijuana use was prohibited under Federal \nlaw. His ignorance or uncertainty about whether marijuana was prohibited under Federal \nlaw does not excuse his conduct. See ISCR Case No. 19-00540 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 13, \n2019)(citing Rhode Island v. Massachusetts, 45 U.S. 591, 613 (1846)). \nApplicant\u2019s disclosures about his drug involvement and associations have been \ninconsistent throughout the security clearance investigation and adjudication. In his May \n2023 response to DOHA interrogatories, he stated that his marijuana use continued until \n\u201clate 2022\u201d; however, in his June 2023 Answer, he stated that his use ended following his \nSeptember 2022 OPM interview. As of his May 2023 response to interrogatories, \nApplicant still associated with his father, a marijuana user, but, as of his FORM response, \nhis father ceased his marijuana use as of September 2022. \nIn his response to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant stated that he did not intend to \nuse marijuana in the future. In his FORM Response, Applicant stated that he did not \n\u201canticipate to have any plans to use marijuana.\u201d Applicant has not clearly and convincingly \nexpressed his intent to abstain from marijuana use. AG \u00b6 26(b)(3) does not apply. \nI have considered the length, frequency, and recency of Applicant\u2019s marijuana use. \nI have also considered that his marijuana use persisted after he submitted his e-QIP and \nbegan his employment with a DOD contractor, and potentially after his September 2022 \nOPM interview. Applicant\u2019s marijuana use to alleviate pain and reduce the risk of stroke \nand seizure still violates Federal law and does not mitigate the triggered security \nconcerns. Applicant\u2019s recreational use of marijuana prior to his injury and his inconsistent \nstatements about his drug use and associations undercut his credibility, reliability, and \ngood judgment. Taking the record evidence in its entirety, Applicant has not mitigated the \ndrug involvement and substance misuse security concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a position of trust by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n______________________ \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nposition of trust must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline H and the \nfactors in AG \u00b6 2(d) in this whole-person analysis. \nApplicant\u2019s lengthy history of marijuana use predates his March 2022 injury. He \nfailed to disclose his previous drug arrest and his pre-injury marijuana use on his e-QIP, \nand he omitted his marijuana use between 2019 and June 2022 during his OPM interview. \nHis inconsistent statements \u2013 about his marijuana use and associations \u2013 cast doubts on \nhis trustworthiness, reliability, and judgment. In the future, with the passage of time and \nan established pattern of abstinence, he may sufficiently mitigate those security concerns. \nAt present, Applicant did not mitigate the drug involvement security concerns. Eligibility \nfor access to classified information is denied. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a.-1.b.: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, I conclude \nthat it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant \neligibility for a security clearance.

The DCSA CAS acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines implemented by the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nIn Applicant\u2019s June 13, 2023 response to the SOR (Answer), he admitted, with \nexplanation, SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. and 1.b.

He \nprovided a two-page response to the FORM (FORM Response) and did not submit any \ndocumentary evidence. \nOn February 15, 2024, I issued a decision denying Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access \nto classified information. On March 7, 2024, Applicant appealed that decision. On May 1, \n2024, the DOHA Appeal Board remanded the case to me for what it considered to be \nerrors within the findings of fact and the analysis. On May 8, 2024, I received the case. \nOn May 15, 2024, Department Counsel moved to amend SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. and 1.b. \nand to add allegations SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a.-2.c. under Guideline E (personal conduct) (Hearing \nExhibit (HE) 2). On May 28, 2024, I reopened the evidentiary record to provide both \nparties the opportunity to supplement the record. I also permitted Applicant to elect a \nhearing or to proceed based upon the written record. In Applicant\u2019s June 3, 2024 response \n(HE 3), he elected to have a hearing, and he did not object to Department Counsel\u2019s \nmotion to amend the SOR. \nOn June 5, 2024, DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing, scheduling a hearing by video \nteleconference for July 9, 2024. The hearing proceeded as scheduled. The Government \nproffered nine exhibits, which I admitted as Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 7 and \nAdministrative Notice (AN) I and II without objection. Of note, the Appeal Board \nconsidered new evidence introduced by Applicant on appeal, which was proffered and \nadmitted as GE 7. Applicant testified and proffered three exhibits, which I admitted as \nApplicant Exhibits (AE) A through C without objection. DOHA received the hearing \ntranscript (Tr.) on July 22, 2024. The record closed on July 22, 2024. \nAmendments to the SOR \nAs discussed above, on May 15, 2024, Department Counsel moved to amend SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a. and 1.b. to read as follows: \na. From about 2019 until at least September 2022, you used marijuana with \nvarying frequency. \nb. From about June 2022 until at least August 2022, you purchased marijuana on \nvarious occasions. \nDepartment Counsel also moved to add SOR \u00b6 2 as follows: \n2.

You deliberately omitted that from 2019 until about May 2022, you \nused marijuana without having a medical marijuana card. \nApplicant did not object to the motion to amend. In his June 5, 2024 email, he \nadmitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. and 1.b. as amended. He disagreed with the use \nof the word \u201cdeliberately\u201d within the Guideline E allegations. I granted the motion to amend \nwithout objection and provided Applicant an opportunity to respond to the amended \nallegations and submit evidence. At the outset of the hearing, I reviewed the amended \nallegations with Applicant, who specifically admitted the facts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. and 1.b.

(GE 3, GE 4; Tr. 33, 35-38, 67) \nDrug Involvement \nFrom about 1988 until March 1993, Applicant illegally used marijuana about once \na month. He abstained from illegal drug use while in the Navy. From August 1996 until \nMarch 2004, he illegally used marijuana with varying frequency \u2013 annually to daily. By \nOctober 2000, he was using marijuana two or three times a week. As of 2001, he used \nmarijuana daily, and he illegally purchased marijuana on multiple occasions. In 2004, he \ndiscontinued his use of marijuana given the sensitive nature of his employment. When he \nleft that position in June 2019, he resumed using marijuana. (Tr. 40-50) \nBeginning in 2017, Applicant accompanied his then fianc\u00e9e (L), who had a medical \nmarijuana card, to state-licensed dispensaries to purchase marijuana. He occasionally \nentered the dispensaries with her at the time of purchase, and, following their marriage, \nthe funds she used to purchase marijuana came from their joint account. After June 2019, \nL would use marijuana in the car while Applicant drove her home from the dispensary. \nBetween June 2019 and March 2022, they typically purchased marijuana every two or \nthree months. During this same period, Applicant and L operated a group home for adults \nwith disabilities. While at the group home, Applicant and L would use marijuana in the \ngarage after hours. Between June 2019 and May 2022, Applicant illegally used marijuana, \npurchased under his wife\u2019s medical marijuana card, about two or three times a week. He \nlast used marijuana with his second wife in March or May 2022. Applicant himself did not \nhave a medical marijuana card until June 2022. He admitted that he was aware, at the \ntime of his use, that his recreational marijuana use violated state drug laws. (Tr. 40-50, \n61, 69-76) \nIn June 2022, Applicant obtained a medical marijuana card and used marijuana \nalmost daily. He purchased marijuana twice \u2013 in June 2022 and August 2022 \u2013 from state-\nlicensed dispensaries. He testified that he last used marijuana in August 2022; however, \nhe retained his recently purchased marijuana until after his September 6, 2022 security \ninterview. After the security interview, Applicant disposed of his remaining marijuana. In \nhis June 13, 2023 Answer, Applicant admitted that he last purchased marijuana on August \n29, 2022 and that he had not used marijuana since his security interview. (Answer; GE 6, \nGE 7; Tr. 50-56) \nIn October 2000, Applicant was charged with possession of less than 20 grams of \nmarijuana, a misdemeanor offense.1 A friend, with whom Applicant had connected with \nhis marijuana dealer, had an adverse reaction to marijuana. Law enforcement officers \narrested, booked, and charged Applicant. In November 2000, he appeared in court and \nwas sentenced to a pre-trial diversion program. Upon completion of the program, the \ncharge was dismissed in February 2001.

(AE A) \n \nAt the hearing, Applicant explained that he had been unsure about the legality of \nhis marijuana use in the summer of 2022, yet he continued to use marijuana in August \n2022. Although he had not consumed all of the marijuana from his first purchase, he \npurchased additional marijuana from a different dispensary on August 29, 2022, after he \nhad completed his security clearance application. At the time of his August 2022 \nmarijuana use, he was principally concerned with whether marijuana use conflicted with \nhis prospective employer\u2019s polices or policies for DOD clearance holders. He testified that \nhe last used marijuana prior to his submission of the e-QIP. Applicant continues to see \nhis first wife about once a month; however, she has not used marijuana in Applicant\u2019s \npresence since 2004. In his Answer, Applicant confirmed his intent to abstain from illegal \ndrug use in the future. (Tr. 55-56, 61) \nFalsifications \nUnder Guideline E, the SOR alleges that Applicant deliberately falsified an e-QIP \nsubmitted on August 18, 2022, in response to two queries (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a. and 2.b.) and \nthat Applicant deliberately provided false information during an interview with an \nauthorized investigator on behalf of the Department of Defense, conducted on September \n26, 2022 (SOR \u00b6 2.c.). In his Answer and FORM response, Applicant attributed his \nomissions to memory problems following a March 2022 accident. \nApplicant testified that his memory problems resulted from a fall on March 29, \n2022. He injured his spine, fractured his ribs, and sustained a traumatic brain injury (TBI). \nHe was hospitalized for three or four days. Immediately after the accident, he experienced \nvisual hallucinations on a near daily basis. Despite his head injury, he returned to full time \nemployment about two weeks after the accident, and he administered his own \nmedications throughout. He continued to drive to and from work, although he did \nexperience some hallucinations due to the head injury. His concerns about using opioids \nfor pain managements prompted him to obtain a medical marijuana card in June 2022. In \nhis Answer, FORM Response, appeal brief, and hearing testimony, Applicant explained \nthat he did not recall his mid-2019 to May 2022 marijuana use at the time he completed \nhis August 2022 e-QIP. (Answer; FORM Response; GE 7; Tr. 64, 73-82) \nNotwithstanding his injuries, Applicant hired a divorce attorney and filed for divorce \nin May 2022. He applied for and obtained a medical marijuana card for pain management. \nBecause his wife ran the group home, he was terminated from his employment after he \nfiled for divorce in May 2022. He searched for and applied for a DOD contractor position, \nand he completed the e-QIP on his home computer over a period of two days. He \ncontacted his sister for assistance in answering some of the questions, and he ran a credit \nbureau report for the financial queries. He did not contact any criminal court or run a \ncriminal records check.

At the time he completed his e-QIP, his contentious divorce from his second wife \u2013 \nwith whom he had frequently used marijuana between mid-2019 and March 2022 \u2013 was \nthe primary focus in his life. (Tr. 80, 86-88, 91) \nIn Applicant\u2019s August 2022 e-QIP, under Section 13 \u2013 Employment Activities, he \nreported that he was going through a divorce and his estranged wife was also his \nbusiness partner. He referenced he was \u201crecovering from recent injury\u201d as of June 2022. \nUnder Section 22 \u2013 Police Record, Applicant answered \u201cNO\u201d in response to \u201cHave you \nEVER been charged with an offense involving alcohol or drugs?\u201d Under Section 23 \u2013 \nIllegal Use of Drugs or Drug Activity, Applicant answered \u201cNO\u201d in response to \u201cIn the last \nseven (7) years, have you illegally used any drugs or controlled substances?\u201d Under \nSection 24 \u2013 Use of Alcohol, Applicant reported his 1995 alcohol rehabilitation treatment. \nApplicant did not report his October 2000 charge for marijuana possession or any of his \nmarijuana use. Besides the reference to a \u201crecent injury,\u201d there is no mention in the e-\nQIP of any head injury or memory issues that may have impacted Applicant\u2019s ability to \naccurately complete the e-QIP. (GE 3) \nOn September 26, 2022, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator \non behalf of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). During the interview, Applicant \nwas twice questioned whether he had ever been charged with a felony offense or a drug \noffense. He twice denied such an occurrence. When the investigator confronted Applicant \nabout a 2000 drug possession charge, Applicant explained that he had not known it was \na felony drug offense. During the interview, Applicant admitted that he had been using \nmarijuana about three times a week and purchasing marijuana every few months at the \ntime of his 2000 arrest. He was arrested, fingerprinted, and charged. Later, Applicant \nappeared in court and the charge was dismissed. During the OPM interview, Applicant \nexplained that he omitted the drug possession charge because he had forgotten about it \nor because he thought he did not need to list it. He further explained that he mis-read the \nquestion requiring him to report any alcohol or drug offense on his e-QIP. (GE 4)   \nDuring his September 2022 security interview, Applicant admitted that he first used \nmarijuana from 1998 until 2004. He then started using again after getting his medical \nmarijuana card on June 7, 2022. He had obtained the medical marijuana card to alleviate \npain from an injury sustained after he fell from a ladder in late March 2022. Prescription \nmedications had not adequately alleviated his pain and had negative side effects. During \nthe interview, Applicant admitted that he used marijuana daily and spent approximately \n$150-200 total on marijuana. He ceased using marijuana in early September 2022 \nbecause he was unsure whether his new employer permitted the use of medical \nmarijuana. When confronted about why he omitted his marijuana use on his e-QIP, he \nclaimed that he had been confused about the difference between state and Federal drug \nlaws. During the interview, Appellant stated that he would continue his medical marijuana \nuse unless it is prohibited by his employer. (GE 4) \nIn his May 18, 2023 response to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant adopted the \nsummary of the OPM interview without any corrections, revisions, or additions.

He reported that L had regularly \nused marijuana in Applicant\u2019s presence, and that his father and first wife continued to use \nmarijuana in Applicant\u2019s presence. (GE 4) \nIn his FORM Response, Applicant explained the link between the TBI and his \nmemory issues. He stated, \u201cIt was a difficult time as memory issues were entrenched with \nmy condition. It was difficult to create new memories and long term memories were sparce \n[sic] with several gaps.\u201d (GE 6) \nIn his appeal brief, Applicant stated that he believed it was acceptable under \nFederal drug laws to purchase and use marijuana for treating a TBI. He further explained \nthat he was unaware that Federal and state drug laws differed on the legality of medicinal \nmarijuana use, and he relied upon the U.S. patent for medicinal marijuana. Applicant also \naverred that, at the time he completed his e-QIP, he had no recollection of his marijuana \nuse between 2004 and May 2022 due to his head injury. He claimed that, by the time of \nhis FORM response, he had regained some of his pre-injury memories. (GE 7) \nAt the hearing, Applicant was questioned about his omitted drug charge and drug \nuse. He twice addressed the omissions: \nAt the time of getting my medical marijuana card, I had no knowledge or \nrecollection of using it with [L] before the incident, so to me, this was the \nfirst time I\u2019d used it since 2004. (Tr. 50) \nI believe I wrote that I had not [used illegal drugs], because at the time I \nthought I had not used illegal drugs. I had no knowledge of using illegal \ndrugs, and that is still a [deficit]. I know now that there is a difference \nbetween legal and illegal drugs. (Tr. 58) \nApplicant further explained that he did not understand that medical marijuana use was \nillegal under Federal drug laws, and he had no recollection of any of his (illegal) \nrecreational drug use between June 2019 and May 2022. He acknowledged that he \nrecalled and reported other events in his life between June 2019 and May 2022, but not \nhis drug use. He did not consult L about his marijuana use when he completed his e-QIP \nbecause they were going through a contentious divorce. He also admitted that, at the time \nhe completed his e-QIP, he was aware of his memory problems. He testified that he first \nrecalled his marijuana use between June 2019 and May 2022 during the summer of 2023 \nwhen he was prescribed medication to assist in his recovery from the TBI. (Tr. 58-60) \nApplicant did not submit any documentary evidence from a qualified medical \nprofessional addressing his traumatic brain injury, memory problems, and subsequent \nrecollection of events. Applicant\u2019s first wife submitted a letter attesting to his March 2022 \naccident. Immediately following his fall, Applicant had telephoned his first wife believing \nher to be his wife at the time. Applicant sister corroborated his accident and memory \nproblems.

(AE B, AE C) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nsensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern for drug involvement is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 25. In this case, the following disqualifying conditions potentially apply: \n(a) any substance misuse; and \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia. \nMarijuana is a Schedule I controlled substance under Federal law pursuant to Title \n21, Section 812 of the United States Code. Schedule I drugs are those which have a high \npotential for abuse; have no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United \nStates; and lack accepted safety for use of the drug under medical supervision. Section \n844 under Title 21 of the United States Code makes it unlawful for any person to \nknowingly or intentionally possess a controlled substance not obtained pursuant to a valid \nprescription. \nOn October 25, 2014, the then Director of National Intelligence (DNI) issued \nguidance that changes to laws by some states and the District of Columbia to legalize or \ndecriminalize the recreational use of marijuana do not alter existing federal law or the \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines, and that an individual\u2019s disregard of federal \nlaw pertaining to the use, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains adjudicatively \nrelevant in national security eligibility determinations. \nOn December 21, 2021, the DNI issued clarifying guidance concerning marijuana, \nnoting that prior recreational use of marijuana by an individual may be relevant to security \nadjudications, but is not determinative in the whole-person evaluation. Relevant factors \nin mitigation include the frequency of use and whether the individual can demonstrate \nthat future use is unlikely to recur. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nApplicant admitted using marijuana on many occasions between 1988 and August \nor September 2022; however, he did not use any illegal drugs while serving in the Navy \nor between 2004 and June 2019.

AG \u00b6 25(c) applies. \nConditions that could mitigate the drug involvement security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 26. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand  \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nApplicant knowingly and repeatedly violated drug laws between 1988 and May \n2022, when he illegally purchased and used marijuana. Applicant used marijuana two or \nthree times a week in 2000 and daily in 2001. Applicant\u2019s recreational use of L\u2019s medicinal \nmarijuana violated Federal and state drug laws. He used marijuana two or three times a \nweek between 2019 and May 2022 and nearly daily between June 2022 and August 2022. \nNotwithstanding Applicant\u2019s lengthy and extensive drug history, he has abstained from \nmarijuana use since August 2022, after he was apprised of Federal drug laws prohibiting \nmarijuana. There is no evidence of any drug use, purchase, or associations since August \n2022. Applicant clarified that he had not been present when his father purportedly used \nmarijuana, and he also believed that his father had an active imagination. With over two \nyears without any drug involvement, Applicant has sufficiently distanced himself from his \nillegal drug involvement. He has also testified that he will abstain from future drug use. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b) apply. Applicant mitigated the drug involvement security concerns. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. . . . \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 16. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, \nsecurity official, competent medical or mental health professional involved \nin making a recommendation relevant to a national security eligibility \ndetermination, or other official government representative. \nApplicant denied deliberately falsifying his responses in his e-QIP and denied \ndeliberately providing false information to the DOD investigator. In his e-QIP, he \naccurately reported his employment history, addresses, education history, relatives, and \nfamily information. He accurately responded to the financial queries and about his alcohol \ntreatment. The only two queries that omitted material and relevant information related to \nhis illegal drug use and his marijuana possession charge. He testified that he had \nforgotten about his marijuana charge and that he had no recollection of his marijuana use \nbetween June 2019 and May 2022. While acknowledging the complexities of a TBI, I \ncannot reconcile that he had no recollection of any of the hundreds of uses of marijuana \nor dozens of purchases of marijuana between June 2019 and May 2022. Their joint bank \naccount was used for these purchases, and he traveled with his wife to these \ndispensaries. At the time he completed the e-QIP, Applicant was in the midst of a \ncontentious divorce with the individual with whom he most frequently had used marijuana. \nAlthough Applicant attested to memory issues, he was entrusted with driving, working, \nand administering his own medications shortly after the accident. There is no \ncorroborating evidence as to Applicant\u2019s memory issues specifically as to his marijuana \nuse between June 2019 and May 2022. Given the multitude of instances of marijuana \nuse, I cannot reconcile Applicant\u2019s explanation with the record evidence. AG \u00b6 16(a) \napplies as to SOR \u00b6 2.a. \nAs for Applicant\u2019s omitted marijuana charge, Applicant explained that he forgot this \nincident. Although this was a misdemeanor drug offense, this was the only time that \nApplicant has been arrested and charged. He was also required to attend a pre-trial \ndiversion program. Given the unique nature of this event, I cannot reconcile Applicant\u2019s \nexplanation with the record evidence. AG \u00b6 16(a) applies as to SOR \u00b6 2.b. \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDuring Applicant\u2019s September 2022 interview, he was confronted about his omitted \nmarijuana use. He admitted that he had obtained a medical marijuana card in June 2022 \nand had used marijuana frequently between June and August 2022. He did not disclose \nthat he had used marijuana between June 2019 and May 2022 until his May 2023 \nresponse to the DOHA interrogatories. As discussed above, Applicant\u2019s omission of his \nJune 2019-to-May 2022 marijuana use cannot be reconciled with the record evidence, \nparticularly in the context of discussing his other marijuana use, his injury, and his divorce \nduring the security interview. AG \u00b6 16(b) applies as to SOR \u00b6 2.c. \nThe following personal conduct mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 are potentially \nrelevant: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \nApplicant did not make prompt efforts to correct his falsifications. Rather, he \ndisclosed the full extent of his marijuana use in his May 2023 response to interrogatories. \nEven in that response, he reported that he used marijuana \u201con occasion\u201d as opposed to \ntwo to three times a week as he later testified. AG \u00b6 17(a) does not apply. \nApplicant had a lengthy and extensive history of drug involvement. Between June \n2019 and May 2022, he illegally, recreationally used marijuana purchased using his wife\u2019s \nmedical marijuana card. He then obtained his own medical marijuana card and used \nmarijuana nearly daily until August 2022. His omissions in his e-QIP and during his \nsecurity interview cast serious doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. AG \n\u00b6 17(c) does not apply. He did not mitigate the personal conduct security concerns.  \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a position of trust by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n______________________ \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline H, Guideline \nE, and the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) in this whole-person analysis. \nApplicant frequently used marijuana between about June 2019 and August 2022. \nEven accepting Applicant\u2019s explanation that he was confused about the legality of medical \nmarijuana, his recreational marijuana use prior to June 2022 violated both Federal and \nstate drug laws. I cannot reconcile Applicant\u2019s explanations for his omissions with the \nentirety of the record evidence. Although he mitigated the drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse security concerns, he did not mitigate the personal conduct security \nconcerns arising from his deliberate falsifications on his security clearance application \nand during his security interview. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a.-1.b.: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a.-2.c.: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, I conclude \nthat it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant \neligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nEric H. Borgstrom \nAdministrative Judge \n13 \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is 39 years old. He is unmarried and has no children. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in finance with a minor in accounting in August 2007, and an MBA degree in June 2021. He began his current employment as a Senior Consultant with a major defense contractor in February 2022. He has neither served in nor been employed by the U.S. Department of Defense, and has never held national security eligibility. (GE 1; GE 2; Tr. 6-8, 34.) In early 2010 Applicant, his mother, and his brother lived together in an urban home that his mother rented. At the time, his mother was a co-owner and manager of a Dunkin\u2019 Donuts franchise where his brother was also employed. The three of them decided to purchase a suburban house together for $324,000 in February 2010, for which they all cosigned a mortgage loan. Each of them contributed around $20,000 toward the down payment, and then about $1,000 per month toward their subsequent mortgage and other house expenses. (GE 2; GE 4; Tr. 36-39.) 2 Applicant admits that he knowingly and voluntarily cosigned for his now-delinquent original and refinanced mortgage loans because his mother and brother, with whom he cosigned, would not have qualified for them unless he also agreed to repay them. His salary is now about $133,000 per year, and he received an additional $9,700 annual bonus in 2023.

Based upon a review of the full record, national security \neligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nHistory of Case \nOn April 12, 2023, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency \nConsolidated Adjudication Services (DCSA CAS) issued Applicant a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). \nThe action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4 National \nSecurity Adjudicative Guidelines (AG), which came into effect on June 8, 2017. Applicant \nsubmitted his written Answer to the SOR on May 4, 2023. He admitted the allegations in \nSOR \u00b6 1.a but denied that the Guideline F Security Concern applied to him; and he \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn May 2012, Applicant moved out and stopped contributing to the housing \nexpenses. His brother and mother said that they would cover the costs while he moved \nback to an urban apartment. Later his mother sold her share of the franchise and quit \nworking at Dunkin' Donuts for health reasons. His brother had trouble finding another full-\ntime job, so in 2016 they stopped making payments on the House loan. In 2018 the lender \noffered them an option to conduct a short sale or to refinance the loan with the delinquent \namount added to the outstanding balance. They decided that they wanted to keep the \nhouse, so they chose to refinance and all three cosigned the modified mortgage loan. \nApplicant still did not contribute any payments toward this loan, and his mother and \nbrother again could not afford the payments on their own. The lender foreclosed on the \nhouse in 2022 with an outstanding loan balance of $431,896. After the home was resold, \na $153,221.00 deficiency balance remained on the loan, for which the lender obtained a \ncounty circuit court deficiency judgment against Applicant in August 2022. Applicant\u2019s \nbrother declared bankruptcy and his mother has no income or assets outside of Social \nSecurity. The applicant now helps her rent an apartment. (GE 3; GE 4; AE D; Tr. 28, 40-\n46, 49-51, 53-54) \n \n \nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) assigned the case to me on \nJune 28, 2023, and I received the case file on July 3, 2023. DOHA issued a Notice of \nHearing on July 14, 2023, setting the hearing for July 27, 2023. On that date, Department \nCounsel offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5 into evidence. Applicant testified \nand offered Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through D into evidence. All exhibits were admitted \nwithout objection. I left the record open until August 18, 2023, for possible submission of \nadditional documentary evidence in mitigation or rebuttal. Neither party submitted any \nadditional evidence, and the record closed as scheduled. DOHA received the hearing \ntranscript (Tr.) on August 7, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 39 years old. He is unmarried and has no children. He earned a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in finance with a minor in accounting in August 2007, and an MBA \ndegree in June 2021. He began his current employment as a Senior Consultant with a \nmajor defense contractor in February 2022.

His \nsalary is now about $133,000 per year, and he received an additional $9,700 annual \nbonus in 2023. Nevertheless, he deliberately chose to move out of the home and incur \nadditional housing expenses. In 2017, he knew that the house payments were not being \nmade, but he nevertheless purchased a new car with six years of \u201cunfavorable\u201d high \nmonthly payments. (GE 2; GE 3; GE 4; Tr. 35-36, 46-47.) \nApplicant testified that he has now paid off all his other debts, and provided an \nupdated personal financial statement demonstrating a monthly $2,602 surplus of income \nover his regular living expenses. Nevertheless, he confirmed that he has no intention of \nrepaying the mortgage loan deficiency judgment or contacting the creditor to attempt to \nresolve this debt. (AE A; AE B; AE C; Tr. 47-53, 56.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations, each guideline lists potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in AG \n\u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. \nThe administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(b) and 2(c), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of several variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, pertinent, and reliable information about \nthe person, favorable and unfavorable, in reaching a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that any doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility be resolved in favor of the national security. In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation \nor conjecture. \nAccording to Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to \nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states, \u201cThe applicant \nis responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who applies for national security eligibility seeks to enter a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants eligibility \nfor access to classified information or assignment in sensitive duties. Decisions include, \nby necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or \ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified or sensitive information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of protected information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides, \u201cAny determination under this order adverse to \nan applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, \nSection 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive \ninformation). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part:  \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAG \u00b6 19 describes three conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \nThe guideline includes four conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s admitted financial delinquencies: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant admittedly still owes a judgment debt totaling $153,221. This debt arose \nbecause he chose to spend his available resources on other non-essential expenses \nrather than meet his voluntarily undertaken obligation to his mortgage lender over the \npast decade. He testified to his ongoing unwillingness to repay or otherwise attempt to \nresolve this substantial debt. These facts establish prima facie support for the foregoing \ndisqualifying conditions, and shift the burden to Applicant to mitigate the resulting security \nconcerns. \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond\nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn,\nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear\nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n \n \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant failed to establish mitigation under any of these conditions. The large \ndelinquent debt of concern remains unresolved, demonstrating his current unreliability \nand the potential for recurrent problems. His continuing failure to meet financial \nobligations is not a recent development. He provided no evidence that he obtained or is \nfollowing professional counseling to establish financial responsibility. There are no \ndocumented indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control. His history \nof financial irresponsibility and plan to continue ignoring this judgment debt create \nongoing potential for financial coercion and increased risk of having to engage in illegal \nor otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                      \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \na security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature and \naccountable consultant with an MBA degree who defaulted on more than $153,000 in \nvoluntarily incurred debt. He has no intention to resolve his outstanding delinquent debt \ndespite his current remunerative employment with a defense contractor. There remains \nsignificant potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress, which is likely to \ncontinue. Applicant failed to meet his burden to mitigate the security concerns arising \nunder the Financial Considerations guideline. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security \nclearance.

He was regularly drinking to the point of intoxication He was tired of feeling hungover after drinking, and his wife was worried about him, so he began attending Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings. Between 2014 and 2015, he attended AA meetings regularly, but would relapse once every two to three months and drink about eight to ten beers in an evening. He considered himself an alcoholic, and between 2014 and 2018, only abstained from drinking to avoid being caught by his wife. When he and his wife separated in April 2018, despite recognizing that he was an alcoholic, he was no longer worried about his wife finding out, so he began drinking regularly again. Between his separation and September 2022, he was drinking to intoxication daily, and consuming 12 to 13 drinks each time. He acknowledged that his drinking caused marital strain, which ultimately led to his separation. He has developed cirrhosis of the liver as a result of his alcohol consumption. (Items 3-9) App",

(Items 3-9) \nApplicant\u2019s desire to drink is at least partially provoked by his being clinically \ndepressed. The result of his alcohol consumption is that it makes him feel numb, and \nthat makes him feel less depressed. Over the years, he has sought alcohol-related \ntreatment from duly qualified health professionals. These health professionals advised \nhim to abstain from alcohol. A medical doctor (MD) diagnosed him with alcohol \ndependence between 2014 and 2019. Medical records from the MD note Applicant had \nperiods of abstinence and relapse. He underwent outpatient alcohol-related treatment \nfrom May 2016 until February 2017 with Treatment Center A. A duly qualified health \nprofessional at Treatment Center A diagnosed him with alcohol use disorder, early \nremission, severe, and alcohol dependence in remission. After continuing to struggle \nwith alcohol, he also sought alcohol-related treatment with a licensed clinical social \nworker in 2019, who diagnosed him with alcohol abuse, uncomplicated. This licensed \nclinical social worker noted that Applicant had been consuming alcohol while under her \ncare. Between 2019 and 2023, he also met with about four other counselors for alcohol \nand mental health counseling. (Items 3-9) \nIn September 2022, a licensed psychologist and doctor of psychology \n(Psychologist) interviewed Applicant after reviewing documents related to his security \nclearance application, including medical records from some of the aforementioned \nhealthcare providers. During their interview, Applicant acknowledged that he had been \nconsuming about 12 to 13 drinks daily. He stated that he had been attending SMART \nrecovery sessions weekly and has been on prescription medications to help him stop \ndrinking.

His children and \nhis estranged wife are aware that he has a problem with alcohol. Some of his \ncolleagues at work are aware of his alcohol issues as well. (Items 3-9) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nThe security concern for alcohol consumption is set out in AG \u00b6 21: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 22. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgement, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder; \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional \n(e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical \nsocial worker) of alcohol use disorder; \n(e) the failure to follow treatment advice once diagnosed; and \n(f) alcohol consumption, which is not in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations, after a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder. \nFor extended periods over the last decade, Applicant was binge-drinking alcohol \nalmost daily to the point of intoxication. AG \u00b6 22(c) is established. \nAG \u00b6 22(d) is not established. There is evidence in the record that qualified \nmental health professionals diagnosed Applicant with an alcohol use disorder. However, \nthe only SOR paragraph that contains an alcohol use disorder allegation states that \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndiagnosis is contained in an October 22, 2020 report by the Psychologist. There is no \nreport from the Psychologist from that date (or any date near it) in the record. As the \nspecific alcohol use disorder allegation from the SOR is unsupported by the evidence, \nthat disqualifying condition is not established. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 22(e) and 22(f) are not established. As the only SOR allegation \nconcerning an alcohol use disorder averred it was contained in a report not in evidence, \nI cannot find an alcohol use disorder was established or that Applicant failed to follow \ntreatment after such a diagnosis. \nI find for Applicant with respect to the allegations contained in SOR \u00b6 1.b. That \nparagraph alleges that he continued to consume alcohol after treatment, but it does not \nallege an alcohol use disorder diagnosis or a failure to follow treatment advice. As \nwritten, this paragraph does not state disqualifying facts. \nI find for Applicant with respect to the allegations contained in SOR \u00b6 1.c. SOR \u00b6 \n1.c alleges that Applicant\u2019s alcohol consumption was the primary factor in his legal \nseparation. While the fact that his alcohol consumption contributed to his marital \nseparation is unfortunate, it is not disqualifying. \nI also find for Applicant with respect to the allegations contained in SOR \u00b6 1.d. \nSOR \u00b6 1.d alleges that, in an October 22, 2020 report, a psychologist diagnosed \nApplicant with alcohol use disorder, moderate. While there is evidence in the record that \nother qualified mental health professionals diagnosed him with an alcohol use disorder, \nthere is no October 22, 2020 report in the record. The SOR allegation specifically relies \nupon a diagnosis contained in a report that is not in the record, so there is insufficient \nevidence to sustain that allegation. \nConditions that could mitigate alcohol consumption security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 23. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment;  \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations; and \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with \ntreatment recommendations. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI commend Applicant for voluntarily seeking treatment for his issues with alcohol. \nI also commend him for having been abstinent since June 1, 2023. However, given his \nmany false dawns over the past decade, where he abstained from alcohol pursuant to \ntreatment advice and then relapsed, I do not find that another relapse is unlikely to \nrecur. Additionally, given his many relapses after extensive treatment and advice to \nabstain over an extended time, I do not find this period of abstinence constitutes a clear \nand established pattern of abstinence. AG \u00b6\u00b6 23(a), 23(b), and 23(d) do not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline G in my whole-person analysis. While Applicant\u2019s current period of abstinence \nis a significant step in the right direction, given his long history of treatment and relapse, \nhe has not mitigated the alcohol consumption security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline G: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b-1.d: \nFor Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

Department Counsel was ready to proceed on September 2, \n2023, and the case was assigned to me on February 29, 2024. On March 11, 2024, the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was \nscheduled to be conducted by video teleconference on April 23, 2024. I convened the \nhearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 5 were admitted in evidence \nwithout objection. Applicant testified, presented the testimony of four witnesses, and \nsubmitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through M, which were admitted without objection. \nDOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on May 2, 2024. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, she admitted the allegations in the SOR. Her \nadmissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 26-year-old systems engineer employed by defense contractors \nsince September 2019. In college, she majored in aerospace engineering and minored in \nmathematics. She received a bachelor\u2019s degree cum laude in May 2019. She received a \nsecurity clearance in September 2019. She is currently pursuing a master\u2019s degree in \nsystems engineering. \nWhen Applicant submitted her SCA in April 2019, her answers to some of the \nquestions were extensive and detailed. She listed all her full-time and part-time jobs while \nin college. (GX 2 at 14-20) She listed extensive foreign travel (GX 2 at 46-64) and \nnumerous foreign friends and contacts (GX 2 at 27-43). She responded \u201cNo\u201d to the \nquestion in Section 23 of the SCA, asking if she had illegally used any drugs or other \ncontrolled substances in the last seven years. (GX 2 at 68) \nWhen Applicant submitted another SCA in June 2022, she disclosed that she used \nmarijuana with varying frequency from about May 2016 to February 2022 and that she \nused ecstasy at least twice from May 2021 to at least August 2021, while granted access \nto classified information. (GX 1 at 81-82) In her response to the SOR, she admitted that \nshe used ecstasy after she was granted access to classified information. She admitted \nthat she used marijuana while in college during the summers but refrained from using it \nduring the school year. She admitted that she used ecstasy twice in 2022, once at a party \nand once at a concert, because of curiosity and a desire for a new experience. \nWhen Applicant was interviewed by a security investigator in August 2022, she \ntold the investigator that she used marijuana and ecstasy with friends, including her \ncurrent boyfriend. (GX 3 at 9-10) At the hearing, she estimated that she used marijuana \n30 to 40 times during a six-year period. (Tr. 75) She last used marijuana in February 2022. \n(Tr. 88) \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, she stated that she was surprised and confused \nwhen she reviewed her 2019 SCA. She described her failure to disclose her drug use as \nan \u201coversight,\u201d and she attributed it to being young, naive, and afraid.

She also admitted that she knew she was required to self-report \nher illegal drug use. She explained that she believed her personal life and her professional \nlife were \u201ctwo completely different worlds,\u201d and she was nervous about the implications \nof reporting her drug use because she knew she would lose her job. (Tr. 77) \nApplicant has moved away from the college community where much of her drug \nuse occurred. She occasionally associates with individuals with whom she previously \nused illegal substances, but she has informed them that she will not engage in any future \nillegal drug use. She testified that she has established a \u201chard boundary\u201d with her friends, \nand she will excuse herself from any environment where illegal drugs are being used. (Tr. \n82) \nApplicant began dating her current boyfriend in 2017. They began living together \nin September 2022. (Tr. 86) She testified that her live-in boyfriend still uses marijuana, \nwhich is legal in the jurisdiction where they live, but that she has set a \u201chard boundary,\u201d \nprohibiting him from keeping or using marijuana in the apartment, and her boyfriend has \nagreed to respect it. (Tr. 91-92) \nOn July 12, 2023, she submitted a statement of intent to refrain from using, \npurchasing, or being involved with illegal drugs, and she acknowledged that a future \ninvolvement in illegal drug use may be grounds for revocation or denial of national security \neligibility. (AX I) At the hearing, she submitted negative drug test results from July 2023, \nNovember 2023, and March 2024. (AX J, K, and L) She also submitted a certificate \nreflecting her completion of a drug and alcohol awareness class (AX M) \nA coworker who has known Applicant for about a year and holds a top secret \nclearance testified that Applicant\u2019s commitment to protecting classified information is very \nstrong, that she is dedicated to maintain protocol and knowledgeable in ways to control \ndiscussions to protect classified information. Applicant admitted to her that she had used \ndrugs while holding a clearance. The coworker believed that it was a difficult conversation, \nand that Applicant was remorseful for her behavior. She believes that Applicant has \nlearned from her mistakes, and that she can be trusted with classified information. (Tr. \n18-26) \nA senior officer of a major defense contractor testified that he met Applicant when \nhe was running an elite hiring program that accepts only about one percent of applicants. \nHe personally interviewed Applicant and monitored her while she was in the program, \nwhich required access to classified projects. He regarded her as one of the best \nparticipants in the program. He considers her a very honest and straightforward person. \nHe believes that she is very remorseful for falsifying her SCA. He believes that she is not \nupset because she was caught, but because it affects people\u2019s trust in her character.

(Tr. 33-50) \nA former coworker who has held a clearance for 17 years testified that he worked \nwith Applicant on classified projects and that she was very proactive in protecting \nclassified information. He considered Applicant a \u201ctop performer,\u201d a hard worker, detail-\noriented, and \u201ca joy to be around as a coworker.\u201d He considered her trustworthy, honest, \nand forthcoming. When Applicant disclosed the issues regarding her security clearance, \nshe was disappointed in herself and deeply regretted her mistakes. He has no doubts \nabout her professional or personal judgment and would trust her to work again in a \nclassified environment. (Tr. 111-19) \nApplicant\u2019s father is retired from a career in the health care business. He testified \nthat Applicant was a hard worker and a dedicated athlete in college, with strong religious \nbeliefs and \u201ccore middle class values.\u201d He testified that he was \u201cfloored\u201d when Applicant \ntold him about her drug involvement. He believes that Applicant is remorseful, has \nmatured, and has learned from her mistakes. (Tr. 55-62) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan at 531. \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 (App. \nBd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd.

Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan at 531.  \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant used marijuana with varying frequency from about \nMay 2016 until at least February 2022, including times when she was granted access to \nclassified information. The security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence submitted at the hearing establish the \nfollowing disqualifying conditions under this guideline: \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 25(a): any substance misuse (see above definition); \nAG \u00b6 25(c): illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug \nparaphernalia; and \nAG \u00b6 25(f): any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 26(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \nAG \u00b6 26(b): the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nThe first prong of AG \u00b6 26(a) (happened so long ago) focuses on whether the drug \ninvolvement was recent. There are no bright line rules for determining when conduct is \nrecent. The determination must be based on a careful evaluation of the totality of the \nevidence. If the evidence shows a significant period of time has passed without any \nevidence of misconduct, then an administrative judge must determine whether that period \nof time demonstrates changed circumstances or conduct sufficient to warrant a finding of \nreform or rehabilitation. ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). \nThe period of time from February 2022 until the present is a \u201csignificant period of \ntime.\u201d During that time, she submitted another SCA in June 2022, was interviewed by a \nsecurity investigator in August 2022, received the SOR in June 2023, and has been \nawaiting the outcome of the hearing that was held on April 2024. In short, she has been \nliving under a microscope while trying to overcome the security concerns raised by her \ndrug abuse. She has also continued to associate with drug-using friends and living with \nher marijuana-using boyfriend. Under these circumstances, the period of time between \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFebruary 2022 until the present is not sufficient to warrant a finding of reform or \nrehabilitation. Based on the evidence, I conclude that Applicant\u2019s drug abuse was recent, \nfrequent, and did not occur under circumstances making it unlikely to recur. \nAG \u00b6 26(b) is not fully established. Applicant provided a signed statement of intent \nin accordance with AG \u00b6 26(b)(3) and she has changed her environment, moving from \nthe college town where much of her drug abuse occurred, but she continues to associate \nwith drug users, including her live-in boyfriend. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant falsified her 2019 e-QIP by answering \u201cNo\u201d to the \nquestion whether, during the last seven years, she had used any illegal drugs or \ncontrolled substances. The security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . . \nThe relevant disqualifying condition is AG \u00b6 16(a): \n[D]eliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nAlthough Applicant admitted the allegation in SOR \u00b6 2(a) in her response to the \nSOR, her admission was equivocal, describing her failure to disclose her drug use as an \n\u201coversight.\u201d At the hearing, she testified that she was \u201cgenuinely surprised\u201d when she saw \nher answer to the question about illegal drug use in her 2019 SCA. These explanations \nfor not disclosing her drug involvement are inconsistent with her careful and detailed \nresponses to other questions in the SCA. I am satisfied that the documentary evidence \nand Applicant\u2019s reluctant and equivocal admissions are sufficient to establish AG \u00b6 16(a).  \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 17(a): the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the \nomission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the \nfacts; and \nAG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthat it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \nAG \u00b6 17(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s correction of her earlier omission was \nnot prompt. While she was not confronted with the facts, she was confronted with the \ndecision whether to continue \u201cliving a lie\u201d or being truthful in her 2022 SCA. To her credit, \nshe chose to be truthful. \nAG \u00b6 17(c) is not fully established. Applicant\u2019s falsification was arguably infrequent, \nbut it was recent and did not happen under unique circumstances. It was not \u201cminor.\u201d \nIntentional falsification of an SCA is a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a71001, a serious offense \npunishable by up to five years in prison, and it \u201cstrikes at the heart of the security \nclearance process.\u201d ISCR Case No. 09-01652 (App. Bd. Aug. 8, 2011.) \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines H and E in my whole-person \nanalysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions under Guidelines H and E, and evaluating all the evidence in \nthe context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security \nconcerns raised by her drug involvement and personal conduct. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H (Drug Involvement): \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E (Personal Conduct):  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nClearance is denied. \nLeRoy F.

(GE 4 at 1, 6, GE 3 at 6) \nShe has about $50 in the bank and about $3,000 in a retirement account. She sought and \nreceived credit counseling in 2023.

She received a favorable overall evaluation for 2023 and her 2024 \nperformance evaluation was in progress and very favorable. (AE A-C) \nPolicies \nThe standard set out in the adjudicative guidelines for assignment to sensitive \nduties is that the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that assigning \nthe person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security. \nSEAD 4, \u00b6 E.4. A person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, \nby necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or \ninadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive information.  \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n   \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the \nadjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in \nconjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. Under AG \n\u00b6 2(b), any doubt will be resolved in favor of national security. The Government must \npresent substantial evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \n\u00b6 E3.1.14. Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). An applicant has the ultimate burden of \ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with national security to grant or continue \neligibility for assignment to a public trust position.  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe trustworthiness concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified or sensitive information to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout a person\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified or sensitive information. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified or \nsensitive information. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe record evidence, including credit reports and Applicant\u2019s statements, establish \nthree disqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d), \nAG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d), and AG \u00b6 19(f) (\u201cfailure to . . \n. pay annual Federal . . . income tax as required\u201d).

Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems primarily started in August 2016 when the warehouse where she had worked \nfor almost eight years closed. She could no longer afford to pay her mortgage or other \nbills. Her unemployment from August to October 2016, underemployment from October \n2016 to September 2022, unanticipated medical and insurance expenses, and limited \nemployability due to medical issues were largely beyond her control. She prioritized \npaying current financial obligations with her limited resources and paid delinquent debts \nwhen she could. She obtained financial counseling, has resolved, is resolving, or has had \ncancelled seven debts totaling $21,961 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.f-1.h, 1.p-1.r) She has made \nregular payments on her overdue federal income taxes since March 2021, entered an \ninstallment agreement with the IRS in March 2023, and has made required payments. \nAlthough her remaining debt totaling about $11,000 has not been resolved she plans to \naddress it as her finances permit. \nThe adjudicative guidelines do not require that an applicant make payments on all \ndelinquent debts simultaneously, pay debts alleged in the SOR first, or resolve every debt \nalleged in the SOR. Although Applicant\u2019s financial records and finances are not perfect, \nshe has \u201cacted responsibly given her limited resources.\u201d ADP Case No. 22-00180 at 3 \n(App. Bd.

The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). I considered the entire record, including \nthat Applicant\u2019s financial problems were caused, in part, by circumstances beyond her \ncontrol. I considered her work history, limited financial resources, debt resolution efforts, \ncharacter evidence, and her understanding of the importance of financially responsible \nbehavior. I found her testimony to be credible and consistent with her past disclosures. \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nmitigated the trustworthiness concerns based on financial considerations. Accordingly, I \nconclude she has carried her burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with national \nsecurity to grant her eligibility for a public trust position. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.r: \nFor Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant \nApplicant eligibility for a public trust position.

Over the next several years, \nhe was prescribed multiple medication variations, but nothing seemed to provide long \nterm relief and he described periods where he was \u201cviewing the world through a fog.\u201d \n(Answer; GX 1-2; AX L, U; Tr. 33-35, 42-46, 65-68) \nIn about 2018, Applicant began experiencing high stress while working full-time as \na department manager within a grocery store and continuing his college studies. He \nbegan researching illegal drugs as an option to self-medicate for his ongoing symptoms \nof anxiety and depression. He first tried LSD in July 2018 and described it as allowing him \nto willfully \u201cstep into insanity\u201d while positively addressing his anxiety and depression. (GX \n2) His use of LSD quickly became habitual as a self-described treatment for his mental \nhealth. He purchased the LSD from a food vendor that serviced his grocery store. He \nknew that the purchase and use of LSD was illegal (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.c).

Although he lived with his parents, he was \nable to keep his drug use concealed from them. He also continued to see his doctor and \nrecalled being diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and major depressive \ndisorder. He never informed his doctor of his LSD use even though he periodically \nreceived prescriptions for his mental health. He claimed that he was careful not to mix \nany medications with his use of LSD. (GX 2; AX C, V; Tr. 42-54) \nIn April 2019, Applicant left his employment with the grocer to focus on completing \nhis bachelor\u2019s degree. However, he continued to regularly use LSD. He admitted his use \nwas \u201cquite excessive\u201d during this time and that he \u201cwent overboard\u201d in using LSD to \nmanage his mental health symptoms. (GX 1-2; AX L; Tr. 34-35) \nWith the start of the COVID pandemic, Applicant lost contact with his supplier of \nLSD. After completing his bachelor\u2019s degree in March 2020, he tried to stop using LSD in \norder to focus on his career. However, he found that there were no entry-level positions \nin his desired career, and he continued to want LSD as a stress relief. After a few months \nof not using LSD, he researched purchasing options through the dark web and ultimately \nused a TOR browser, the dark web, and cryptocurrency to continue purchasing and using \nLSD. During this period, his LSD use stopped being for self-medication and \u201cwas more or \nless a crutch to get me through every week, week after week.\u201d (GX 2; AX L; Tr. 34-38; \n51-54) \nIn August 2021, Applicant began working with another grocer and found a new \nsupplier for his ongoing use of LSD. In April 2022, a coworker offered to exchange \npsychedelic mushrooms with him for LSD and cash. Applicant was curious if the \nmushrooms could provide similar mental relief with less side effects than the LSD. He \ncompleted the exchange and tried mushrooms on two occasions in April and May 2022, \nbefore returning to LSD. He understood that the mushrooms he used were also illegal at \nthe time (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.d). (Answer; GX 2; AX A, L, U; Tr. 46-51) \nLater in May 2022, Applicant was offered a position as a contractor with his current \nemployer. He described the process of filling out the public trust application in June 2022 \nas a \u201ckick in the pants to quit\u201d his use of LSD. (Tr. 38) He also recommitted to maintaining \na treatment plan through his doctor. However, he used LSD on one additional occasion \nin July 2022 before destroying the remaining LSD and mushrooms in his possession. (GX \n2; AX A, Tr. 38-45) \nSince July 2022, Applicant has not used any illegal drugs and described being \n\u201cfree of that addiction\u201d while he continues to focus on work and his master\u2019s program. (Tr. \n39) He described trying several combinations of medications for his mental health \nsymptoms through 2023. In January 2024, he started his current medication regime and \ndescribed it as working better than anything previous in helping to control his anxiety and \ndepression. He also testified to researching additional counseling to better manage his \nsymptoms.

He no longer associates with any drug \nusers or dealers. He submitted a negative drug test from July 2023 as well as a statement \nof intent to not use any illegal drugs in the future. (Answer; GX 2; AX A, T; Tr. 14-15, 55) \nApplicant submitted several character reference letters from friends and \ncolleagues. They described him as maintaining a strong work ethic and being a \u201ctruly \nvaluable asset to the team.\u201d (AX E) Recent performance evaluations noted that Applicant \nmaintained exceptional focus and exceeded expectations. He has received several \nquality service awards through his current and past employers. (AX E-G, N-R) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant's suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge's overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable trustworthiness \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nsensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard sensitive \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe adjudicative guidelines note several conditions that could raise drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse concerns under AG \u00b6 25. The following are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and  \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia. \nWith the exception of a small break in 2020, Applicant purchased and used LSD \nregularly from about June 2018 through July 2022. He purchased and used psychedelic \nmushrooms on two occasions in about April and May 2022. He knew that his use of LSD \nand mushrooms was illegal at the time. The above disqualifying conditions are \nestablished. \nConditions that could mitigate the drug involvement and substance misuse \nconcerns are provided under AG \u00b6 26. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nIn his Answer to the SOR and during his testimony, Applicant acknowledged and \nspoke candidly about his use of LSD and limited use of psychedelic mushrooms. Since \nJuly 2022, he has terminated his drug use, disassociated from individuals he previously \npurchased drugs from and submitted a signed statement of intent to abstain from any \nfurther drug use. He also spoke of his commitment to his new employment, which was \nbolstered by the statements of his peers and supervisors. These are all positive actions \nthat he has taken toward mitigating the drug involvement and substance misuse \nconcerns. \nHowever, Applicant regularly used LSD over an extended period through July \n2022, including after the submission of his public trust application. He previously \nattempted to terminate his drug use and failed in 2020. He additionally experimented with \npsychedelic mushrooms for two months in 2022. Although he described the purpose of \nhis drug use was to self-medicate for mental health concerns, he also admitted that he \nused LSD excessively and recreationally. Regardless of the purpose, he knew that his \ndrug use was illegal. He also never informed his family or his doctor of his drug use and \ncontinued to take LSD while prescribed mental health medications. Although he testified \nthat he is committed to managing his mental health symptoms through his doctor and \nadditional counseling, not enough time has passed to persuasively demonstrate that his \nuse of LSD and psychedelic drugs is fully in his past. He did not mitigate the \ntrustworthiness concerns under Guideline H. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for public trust access by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nposition of public trust must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline H in my whole-person analysis. \nFrom about July 2018 through July 2022, Applicant regularly used LSD for both \nself-medication and recreational purposes. He also briefly used psychedelic mushrooms. \nHe openly discussed his drug-use history and acknowledged his past mistakes. He is \nworking toward maintaining a consistent treatment plan for his mental health and staying \ndrug free. However, given the extent of his drug use, insufficient time has passed to \nestablish that these trustworthiness concerns are truly behind him. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a-1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant a position of public trust. Eligibility for access to sensitive \ninformation is denied. \nBryan J. Olmos \nAdministrative Judge \n7 \n",

(Item 7) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became effective on June 8, \n2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable trustworthiness decision. \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \ngovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nsensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. \n1  The SOR did not allege that Applicant falsified the first and last two questions. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe trustworthiness concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns \nunder AG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, including multiple delinquent debts. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) are applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations trustworthiness \nconcerns are provided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nApplicant had a stroke in about 2018. She was out of work for several years. She \nwas unable to pay all her bills, and a number of debts became delinquent. Those \nconditions were beyond her control. In order to find AG \u00b6 20(b) applicable, Applicant \nmust prove that she acted responsibly under the circumstances. \nApplicant admitted owing some debts, and she denied owing others. All the \ndebts are listed on a December 2021 credit report, a January 2023 credit report, or both \ncredit reports. Nonetheless, because of what she has been through, I am giving \nApplicant the benefit of the doubt, and I am finding the medical debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, \n1.i, and 1.j) to be mitigated. I am also finding the disputed debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g, \n1.k, and 1.l mitigated. Applicant settled the $707 delinquent debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.m \nfor $353. That debt is mitigated. \nApplicant has not provided sufficient mitigation for any of the other debts. She \ndenied owing the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.h, stating that the debts were \u201cnot \non [her] credit.\u201d However, she agreed that she owed both debts when she was \ninterviewed for her background investigation in December 2021. She stated that she \nwould contact the creditors to arrange payment plans. There is no evidence of any \npayments toward either debt, and both debts are listed on the December 2021 and \nJanuary 2023 credit reports. \nWhen the mitigated debts are eliminated, Applicant still owes more than $24,000 \nfor six delinquent debts, with only a payment of $353 made or before February 8, 2023. \nThat one payment is insufficient for a determination that Applicant acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances or that she made a good-faith effort to pay her debts. I am \nunable to find that her financial problems will be resolved within a reasonable period. \nHer financial issues are recent and ongoing. They continue to cast doubt on her current \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. None of the above mitigating conditions \nare applicable. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \nThe trustworthiness concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as \nfollows: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \n6 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \nclearance investigative or adjudicative processes. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a trustworthiness concern and may \nbe disqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.  \nSOR \u00b6 2.b alleges that Applicant falsified the SF 86 when she failed to report her \ndelinquent debts under the following specific questions: \nIn the past seven (7) years, [have] you had bills or debts turned over to a \ncollection agency? and \nIn the past seven (7) years, [have] you had any account or credit card\nsuspended, charged off, or cancelled for failing to pay as agreed? (Include\nfinancial obligations for which you were the sole debtor, as well as those\nfor which you were a cosigner or guarantor). \n \n \n \nIt is unclear why those specific questions were alleged when there were other \nquestions that were more appropriate. For a finding of an intentional falsification under \nthe first question, the Government must prove by substantial evidence that Applicant \nhad one or more debts that were turned over to a collection agency; that she knew that \nshe had a debt that was turned over to a collection agency; and that she intentionally \nfailed to report that she had a debt that was turned over to a collection agency. \nTo find an intentional falsification under the second question, the Government \nmust prove by substantial evidence that Applicant had one or more accounts that were \nsuspended, charged off, or cancelled for failing to pay as agreed; that she knew that \nshe had such an account; and that she intentionally failed to report that she had such an \naccount. \nApplicant knew she had delinquent debts when she submitted the SF 86. \nHowever, the Government did not prove that when Applicant submitted the SF 86, she \nknew that she had a debt that was turned over to a collection agency or that she knew \nthat she had an account that was suspended, charged off, or cancelled for failing to pay \nas agreed. \nThere is insufficient evidence to establish that Applicant intentionally falsified the \ntwo specific questions alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.a. AG \u00b6 16(a) is not applicable to those \nquestions. SOR \u00b6 2.a is concluded for Applicant. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \npublic trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines E and F in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a public trust position. I conclude Applicant did \nnot mitigate the financial considerations trustworthiness concerns. Personal conduct \ntrustworthiness concerns were not established. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c-1.d: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.e-1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.g: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.h: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.i-1.m: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.n: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_______________________ \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \npublic trust position.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is 66 years old, divorced from his third wife, one adult child. He is an Air Force veteran. Applicant has been employed by a defense contractor since November 2020. (Item 4 at Sections 13A, 15, 17, and 18.) Paragraph 1 (Guideline G, Alcohol Consumption) The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he used intoxicants to excess and therefore is potentially unreliable, or untrustworthy. Applicant admitted all the allegations under this guideline with explanations. 1.a. Applicant admitted that he was arrested for Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol in May 1983. He further stated that he hired a lawyer who argued to the court that Applicant was entrapped. This charge was dismissed as nolle prosequi in 1997. (Item 3 at 7-8; Item 11 at 4.) 1.b. Applicant admitted that he was arrested for Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol in October 1991. He pled nolo contendere in November 1991 and was sentenced to fines and fees. The FBI record states he received confinement for 12 months. In his Answer Applicant stated that he received, \u201ctwelve months\u2019 probation.\u201d No further information was provided.

A \ncomplete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM), consisting of Items 1 to 11, was \nprovided to Applicant, who received the file on August 10, 2023. (It is noted that Item 5 \nwas not legible.) \nApplicant was given 30 days from receipt of the FORM to file objections and submit \nmaterial in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant elected not to file any \nobjections or submit additional material. The case was assigned to me on November 15, \n2023. Items 1 through 11 are hereby entered into evidence. Based upon a review of the \npleadings and exhibits, national security eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 66 years old, divorced from his third wife, one adult child. He is an Air \nForce veteran. Applicant has been employed by a defense contractor since November \n2020. (Item 4 at Sections 13A, 15, 17, and 18.) \nParagraph 1 (Guideline G, Alcohol Consumption) \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance \nbecause he used intoxicants to excess and therefore is potentially unreliable, or \nuntrustworthy. Applicant admitted all the allegations under this guideline with \nexplanations. \n1.a. Applicant admitted that he was arrested for Driving Under the Influence of \nAlcohol in May 1983. He further stated that he hired a lawyer who argued to the court that \nApplicant was entrapped. This charge was dismissed as nolle prosequi in 1997. (Item 3 \nat 7-8; Item 11 at 4.) \n1.b. Applicant admitted that he was arrested for Driving Under the Influence of \nAlcohol in October 1991. He pled nolo contendere in November 1991 and was sentenced \nto fines and fees. The FBI record states he received confinement for 12 months. In his \nAnswer Applicant stated that he received, \u201ctwelve months\u2019 probation.\u201d No further \ninformation was provided. (Item 3 at 9-10; Item 11 at 4.) \n1.c. Applicant admitted that he was arrested for Driving Under the Influence of \nAlcohol in July 1995. He was subsequently found guilty in February 1997 and sentenced \nto 12 months\u2019 probation and a fine. The FBI record states that he also received \nconfinement for ten days. In his Answer Applicant stated that he received, \u201c0 days\u2019 \nconfinement.\u201d (Item 3 at 10-11; Item 4 at 34; Item 11 at 4.) \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n1.d. Applicant admitted that he was arrested for Driving Under the Influence of \nAlcohol in February 1998. He was found guilty in April 1998 and sentenced to pay fines \nand fees, and received twelve months\u2019 probation. (Item 3 at 13-14; Item 4 at 35-36; Item \n7; Item 11 at 4.) \n1.e. Applicant admitted that he was arrested for Driving Under the Influence of \nAlcohol in April 2000. He was found guilty in July 2000 and sentenced to a fine. (Item 3 \nat 15-16; Item 4 at 36-37; Item 11 at 5.) \n1.f. Applicant admitted that he was arrested for Driving Under the Influence of \nAlcohol in March 2014. He was found guilty in February 2016 and sentenced to six \nmonths\u2019 probation, community service, fines and fees, and 24 hours\u2019 confinement. (Item \n3 at 16-17; Item 4 at 30-31; Item 8; Item 9; Item 11 at 7.) \n1.g. Applicant admitted that he was arrested for Driving Under the Influence of \nAlcohol in August 2020. He was eventually found guilty of reckless driving and sentenced \nto six months\u2019 probation, fines and fees, and community service. (Item 4 at 32-33; Item \n11 at 2-3.) \nApplicant elected not to submit any information as to his current use of alcohol. \nAccordingly, I cannot find that he has abstained from alcohol for any period of time. \nParagraph 2 (Guideline H \u2013 Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse) \nApplicant was employed by the Federal government from 1983 to November 2014. \nHe has admitted being involved in a single incident of marijuana use in July 2014 while \nhaving access to classified information and holding a sensitive position. He subsequently \ntested positive for marijuana after an employment-based urinalysis. According to \nApplicant, he was allowed to retire. He further stated that this was his only use of \nmarijuana. (Item 4 at 12-13, 38-39; Item 11 at 6.) \nApplicant elected not to submit any information about his work performance or \nability to safeguard classified information. I am unable to make a credibility assessment \nas he elected not to have a hearing. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nParagraph1 (Guideline G \u2013 Alcohol Consumption) \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for alcohol consumption are set out \nin AG \u00b6 21, which states: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \nAG \u00b6 22 describes two conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder; \nand \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder. \nApplicant has a history of excessive alcohol use. This is shown by his seven \nalcohol-related arrests and convictions from 1983 through 2020. Both disqualifying \nconditions have application to the facts of this case and transfer the burden to Applicant \nto mitigate them. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 23 contains four conditions that could mitigate alcohol \nconsumption security concerns. \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness or \njudgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations;  \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations. \nNone of these mitigating conditions is established by the evidence in this case. \nApplicant made the decision not to respond to the FORM. The record has no information \nthat would support the application of any of the mitigating conditions. Paragraph 1 \n(Alcohol Consumption) is found against Applicant. \nParagraph 2 (Guideline H \u2013 Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse) \nThe security concern relating to Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse is set \nforth in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted \nin this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above.  \nI have examined the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 25 and especially \nconsidered the following: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n(b) testing positive for an illegal drug; and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position.  \nApplicant admitted that he used marijuana a single time in 2014 while employed \nby the Federal government. He held a security clearance and was holding a sensitive \nposition. His drug use was detected due to a positive urinalysis. All of the stated \ndisqualifying conditions apply. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe following mitigating condition under AG \u00b6 26 has also been considered: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \nApplicant\u2019s admitted single use of marijuana occurred in 2014. There is no \nadditional evidence to show that he has used marijuana in the years since that incident, \nwhich resulted in his retirement from Federal employment. That decade-long long time \nspan is sufficient to bring AG \u00b6 26(a) into operation and mitigate whatever security \nsignificance that single use may have had. Paragraph 2 (Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse) is found for Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s potential for national security eligibility by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has not mitigated the \nconcerns over his long-term problems with alcohol. The significant potential for pressure, \ncoercion, or duress remains undiminished. Overall, the record evidence creates \nsubstantial doubt as to Applicant\u2019s present suitability for national security eligibility and a \nsecurity clearance. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n                                                \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline G: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.g: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline H: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a through 2.c: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is 54 years old. He married his wife in August 2012, and they have five adult children between them who were born during previous relationships. Applicant\u2019s three previous marriages ended in divorce. He earned an Associate of Applied Science degree from a private for-profit career college in June 1989, and has since completed other job-related technical training. He began his current employment as UNIX administrator with a defense contractor in November 2021. He reported no former Federal or military service. In October 2021 he submitted an e-QIP in connection with contract work for a Department of Commerce agency, and was granted what he described as a Confidential clearance. His DoD national security eligibility record indicates that he was granted an interim Secret clearance by the DCSA CAS on August 3, 2022. (GE 1; GE 2; GE 4; Tr. 7-8, 30.) Applicant testified that he started using marijuana once a month at around age 15, while in high school from 1984 to 1987. He resumed recreational marijuana use in his mid twenties. He obtained a California medical marijuana card in 2008 or 2009. He obtained marijuana from a friend and used it weekly, on average, until about September 2015 when he moved to his current state of residence. Since then, he and his wife grow marijuana on their property and have smoked or otherwise used marijuana on a daily basis. He and his wife both intend to continue their regular use of marijuana.

On July 12, 2023, Department Counsel \nsent Applicant a copy of his File of Relevant Materials comprising the Government\u2019s \nevidentiary submission to the administrative record, and provided him 30 days to respond \nwith any objections or additional evidence. On August 9, 2023, Applicant responded with \na written request for a hearing. Department Counsel granted the request and converted \nthe case to provide Applicant a hearing. \nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) assigned the case to me on \nSeptember 15, 2023. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on October 2, 2023, setting the \nhearing for October 24, 2023. On that date, Department Counsel offered Government \nExhibits (GE) 1 through 4 into evidence. Applicant testified and offered Applicant\u2019s \nExhibits (AE) A and B into evidence. All exhibits were admitted without objection. DOHA \nreceived the hearing transcript (Tr.) on November 1, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 54 years old. He married his wife in August 2012, and they have five \nadult children between them who were born during previous relationships. Applicant\u2019s \nthree previous marriages ended in divorce. He earned an Associate of Applied Science \ndegree from a private for-profit career college in June 1989, and has since completed \nother job-related technical training. He began his current employment as UNIX \nadministrator with a defense contractor in November 2021. He reported no former Federal \nor military service. In October 2021 he submitted an e-QIP in connection with contract \nwork for a Department of Commerce agency, and was granted what he described as a \nConfidential clearance. His DoD national security eligibility record indicates that he was \ngranted an interim Secret clearance by the DCSA CAS on August 3, 2022. (GE 1; GE 2; \nGE 4; Tr. 7-8, 30.) \nApplicant testified that he started using marijuana once a month at around age 15, \nwhile in high school from 1984 to 1987. He resumed recreational marijuana use in his mid \ntwenties. He obtained a California medical marijuana card in 2008 or 2009. He obtained \nmarijuana from a friend and used it weekly, on average, until about September 2015 when \nhe moved to his current state of residence. Since then, he and his wife grow marijuana \non their property and have smoked or otherwise used marijuana on a daily basis. He and \nhis wife both intend to continue their regular use of marijuana. (GE 1; GE 3; Tr. 30-38.) \nThe evidence in this case confirms that Applicant underwent some type of \ntrustworthiness screening while performing contract work for a Department of Commerce \nagency, but was not employed in a national security sensitive position and had no access \nto classified information during that time. He was granted an interim Secret DoD security \nclearance in August 2022 after submitting his July 2022 e-QIP, and he has continued his \ndaily marijuana use while holding a sensitive position since then.

He recognized that drug \nuse violated Federal law and his employer\u2019s written no-drug-use policy. He said that he \nbrought up his pending DOHA hearing concerning the security clearance concerns raised \nby his drug involvement to his manager and his company\u2019s security officer. He said that \nthe manager seemed more concerned about losing him as an employee, and that the \nsecurity officer said that if he elected to proceed working with his company, he would \nhave to go through an exception process. He acknowledged that he would not be able to \ncontinue working for that company without being granted national security eligibility. (Tr. \n36-38.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations, each guideline lists potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in AG \n\u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. \nThe administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(b) and 2(c), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of several variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, pertinent, and reliable information about \nthe person, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that any doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility be resolved in favor of the national security. In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation \nor conjecture. \nAccording to Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to \nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states, \u201cThe applicant \nis responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who applies for national security eligibility seeks to enter a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants eligibility \nfor access to classified information or assignment in sensitive duties. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \nDecisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant \nmay deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified or sensitive \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of protected information. Section 7 of \nEO 10865 provides, \u201cAny determination under this order adverse to an applicant shall be \na determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination \nas to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing \nmultiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse  \nThe security concerns under the guideline for drug involvement and substance \nmisuse are set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nAG \u00b6 25 describes three conditions that raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying based on the SOR allegations and the evidence in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition);  \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position; and \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \nApplicant admittedly has been a daily user of marijuana for many years and intends \nto continue this conduct. He knew that his marijuana use is illegal under Federal law and \nviolates his company\u2019s employee substance abuse policies. On August 3, 2022, the \nDCSA CAS granted him an interim Secret clearance for access to classified information, \nas required to hold his national security sensitive position, and he has continued his daily \ndrug use since then. This establishes security concerns under AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), 25(f), and \n25(g). Accordingly, the burden to mitigate the established concerns shifts to Applicant. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 26 provides two conditions that could mitigate the drug-related security \nconcerns raised in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;  \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nIn my analysis, I have taken administrative notice of the Security Executive Agent \n(SecEA) Clarifying Guidance Concerning Marijuana for Individuals Eligible to Access \nClassified Information or Eligible to Hold a Sensitive Position, dated December 21, 2021. \nIn her Guidance, the SecEA noted the increased number of states that have legalized or \ndecriminalized the use of marijuana. She reaffirmed the 2014 SecEA memorandum \nregarding the importance of compliance with Federal law on the illegality of the use of \nmarijuana by holders of security clearances. She provided further clarification of Federal \nmarijuana policy, writing that this policy remains relevant to security clearance \nadjudications, \u201cbut [is] not determinative.\u201d She noted that the adjudicative guidelines \nprovided various opportunities for a clearance applicant to mitigate security concerns \nraised by his or her past use of marijuana. \nHowever, the facts of this case do not fall under the purview of the foregoing \nadministrative clarification of Federal marijuana policy, which discusses the possible \ndiscretionary mitigation of national security eligibility disqualification for marijuana \nabusers. Applicant uses marijuana on a daily basis. He has done so for more than eight \nyears and declared his intention to continue doing so. Accordingly, the determination of \nApplicant\u2019s national security eligibility is governed by the non-waivable statutory \nprohibition that precludes the head (or a designated subordinate) of any Federal agency \nfrom granting or renewing a security clearance for an unlawful user of a controlled \nsubstance or an addict. 50 USC \u00a7 3343(b) (the Bond Amendment). \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nApplicant further failed to mitigate the security concerns raised by his regular \nmarijuana use under the AG. He knew that his drug involvement was illegal under Federal \nlaw and contrary to his employer\u2019s substance abuse policies, yet it has continued even \nafter he submitted his e-QIP seeking to obtain national security eligibility and was granted \nan interim security clearance. He freely declares his intention to continue his use of illegal \ndrugs in the future. This evidence establishes that Applicant\u2019s daily drug abuse is most \nlikely to continue, and it casts continuing doubt on Applicant\u2019s current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and judgment. No mitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) or 26(b) was established. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s national security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct \nand all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept, although the AG further \nacknowledge that the Bond Amendment removes any discretion to waive its prohibition \nof granting national security eligibility to drug abusers or drug addicts. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature adult, who \nfreely admits his past and ongoing drug abuse, failing to demonstrate either rehabilitation \nor accountability for his misuse of marijuana before and during the time he was working \nfor a defense contractor and after applying for a security clearance. He has no intention \nto abstain from further substance misuse. He provided insufficient evidence to \ndemonstrate his trustworthiness, responsibility, and willingness to comply with rules and \nregulations. The potential for pressure, exploitation, or duress remains undiminished. \nOverall, the evidence creates significant doubt, as well as a statutory prohibition, \nto Applicant\u2019s national security eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. He did not \nmeet his burden to mitigate the security concerns arising under the Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse guideline. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                      \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a -1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security \nclearance.

The case was assigned to me on January 4, 2024. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, she admitted using marijuana, but she denied \nthe allegation in part, denying that her prior legal use of medical marijuana \u201cis any way \nindicative of [her] ability to serve the national interest in trustworthiness and reliability.\u201d \nHer partial admission is incorporated in my findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 29-year-old cybersecurity penetration tester employed by a defense \ncontractor since January 2022. She received an associate degree in September 2015, a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in August 2017, and a master\u2019s degree in August 2021. She married \nin September 2017. She has never held a security clearance. \nApplicant disclosed her marijuana use in her SCA. She disclosed that she used it \nexperimentally once in 2013, abstained until 2019, used it both recreationally and \nmedically about seven times from 2019 to August 2021, and had abstained from about \nAugust 2021 until April 2022. She stated that she intended to use it in the future, especially \nin legal jurisdictions permissible by ongoing progressive federal and state cannabis \nlegislation and regulations.\u201d She explained, \u201cWhen the controlled substance is not \nabused, there are numerous medical benefits for [her] dietary conditions . . . as well as \noccasional stress-relief alternative benefits.\u201d \nWhen Applicant was interviewed by a security investigator in May 2022, she stated \nthat she did not plan to continue her marijuana use unless it becomes \u201cfederally legal\u201d \nand she received a medical prescription for health reasons. (FORM Item 5 at 5) In \nresponse to DOHA interrogatories on May 4, 2023, she declined to provide a signed \nstatement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and substance misuse and to \nacknowledge that any future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national \nsecurity eligibility. (FORM Item 5 at 11) In her response to the FORM, she submitted a \ncopy of her state-issued medical marijuana card and asked for a waiver, based on her \nrecent diagnosis of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency and fibromyalgia, and promising that \nher use of cannabis would be strictly medical and not recreational. (AX A) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527.

Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline H (Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse) \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence in the FORM establish the following \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 25(a): any substance misuse (see above definition); \nAG \u00b6 25(c): illegal possession of a controlled substance, including \ncultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or \npossession of drug paraphernalia; and \nAG \u00b6 25(g): expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, or failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such \nmisuse. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 26(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 26(b): the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nAG \u00b6 26(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s marijuana use was frequent, recent, and \ndid not occur under circumstances making recurrence unlikely. \nAG \u00b6 26(b) is not established. Applicant has acknowledged her previous marijuana \nuse, but her environment is essentially unchanged, and she specifically declined to \nprovide the signed statement of intent under AG \u00b6 26(b)(3). \nOn October 25, 2014, the Director of National Intelligence issued DNI \nMemorandum ES 2014-00674, \u201cAdherence to Federal Laws Prohibiting Marijuana Use,\u201d \nwhich states, \u201c[C]hanges to state laws and the laws of the District of Columbia pertaining \nto marijuana use do not alter the existing National Security Adjudicative Guidelines . . . .\u201d \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has observed that \u201cDOHA proceedings are not a proper forum \nto debate the pros and cons of whether marijuana should be legal for some purposes, \nhow it should be classified as a controlled substance, or the merits of DoD policy \nconcerning drug abuse.\u201d ISCR Case No. 14-03734 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 18, 2016). \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline H in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Because Applicant requested a \ndetermination on the record without a hearing, I had no opportunity to evaluate her \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncredibility and sincerity based on demeanor. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. \nBd. Jul. 23, 2003). After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under \nGuideline H and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by her drug involvement. \nWaiver \nIn Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM, she requested a waiver of the disqualifying \nconditions under Guideline H. Appendix C to SEAD 4 provides that \u201capproval authorities \nmay approve a waiver only when the benefit of initial or continued eligibility clearly \noutweighs any security concerns.\u201d Applicant has not provided sufficient evidence to \nestablish that her qualifications and potential contributions to national security clearly \noutweigh the security concerns under Guideline H. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

The lab manager of the \nfacility, who worked with Applicant from 2009 to 2018, also wrote a letter on Applicant\u2019s \nbehalf (Tr. at 32-36; GE 1; AE G): \nDuring my time with Chemistry [,] I had oversight of several projects, some \nof which involved [Applicant]. I have been aware of [Applicant\u2019s] struggles \nwith certain mental health issues over the years. She sought help when it \nwas needed and continued to put her work at the forefront of her priorities. \n. . In all my time working with [Applicant] . .., I never knew [her] to release \nany unauthorized information either willingly, or by virtue of her mental \nstate. She was trustworthy enough to maintain the position for her tenure \nat [company]. I recall no instances in which ability to perform sensitive \nduties or make sound judgments were ever questioned. I worked \nalongside [Applicant] in what is regarded as a highly stressful and \nextremely demanding environment. While she may have missed worked to \naddress her mental health concerns at times, I know when she was at \nwork, she was committed to the task at hand and was able to work \nthrough any issues while on site and fulfilled her assignments as \nrequested. (AE G) \nApplicant left the position in October 2017, seeking a position with a better work-\nlife balance to accommodate the needs of her family, which contained two small \nchildren. (Tr. at 82) \nApplicant began receiving regular treatment for her depression in October 2012 \nafter she experienced post-partum depression after the birth of her first child. She has \nreceived treatment from the same certified registered nurse practitioner in psychiatric \nmental health (CRNP-PMH) since 2012 for prescription management. She was \ndiagnosed with major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and borderline \npersonality disorder. In 2014, after experiencing a miscarriage, the CRN-PMH \nrecommended Applicant complete a 45-day out-patient treatment program. She \nparticipated in a second out-patient program in 2015 after the death of her father. Each \ntime she took time away from work to address her mental health, she had to report her \nhospitalization to the nuclear facility\u2019s medical department. She also had to obtain \nclearance from the medical department to return to work. As part of the medical \nclearance process, the facility would contact Applicant\u2019s medical providers. (Tr. at 23-\n25,42-43,53-55,63-66, 84; AE A-B) \nIn October 2017, she started a position as a lab analyst. Although her depressive \nsymptoms remained, she was stable until March 2018, when she required intervention \nthrough voluntary hospitalization. In February 2018, Applicant\u2019s husband suffered an \naccident that resulted in hospitalization and required major surgery. He was out of work \nfor approximately four months. As he recovered, Applicant took on all the childcare and \nhousehold responsibilities while she continued to work fulltime.

Although she completed \nthe required treatment program, and weekly appointments with her care team. Her \nsymptoms persisted, and she began to engage in non-suicidal self-harm. She reported \nher symptoms to her NP, who again recommended a second hospitalization, which \nApplicant entered in May 2018. (Tr. 37-38, 49-50, 56, 60, 41-76, 85) \nShe left her job in May 2018, and remained unemployed until September 2019 to \nfocus on her family and her mental health. Applicant began seeing a certified licensed \nclinical social worker (LCSW-C) for individual counseling. She continued to go to \ncounseling every other week. During her sabbatical, Applicant participated in another \nintensive outpatient program from January 2019 to March 2019. Applicant returned to \nwork at her alma mater in September 2019 as an adjunct professor. She left the position \nafter a year for a better paying position. In August 2020, she began working in her \ncurrent position. According to her current supervisor: (GE 1, AE D, I) \nIn the 2 years and 7 plus months that [Applicant] has worked for me she \nhas been an exemplary employee. She has never given me reason to \ndoubt her judgment, reliability, stability, or trustworthiness... [Applicant] \nconsistently received merit compensation at or above average for my \nteam based on her performance. (AE F) \nIn January 2023, Applicant underwent a psychological evaluation by a DOD-\nappointed evaluator. The DOD evaluator, a licensed psychologist, based their findings \non reviewed investigative records provided to them by DOD, including Applicant\u2019s \nAugust 2020 security clearance application. The evaluator also conducted a 90-minute \nclinical interview with Applicant and administered the Personality Assessment Inventory \n(PAI). The evaluator also talked with Applicant\u2019s treating CRNP-MPH. (GE 2) \nWhen she appeared for the interview, Applicant reported a depressed mood. The \nevaluator also observed that Applicant was able to concentrate and that her thought \npattern was clear and logical. The evaluator observed that Applicant did not make any \napparent attempts to be deceptive with the evaluator or attempt to minimize her difficulty \nwith depression, anxiety and suicidality. Applicant also demonstrated that she \nunderstood and appreciated the severity of her mental health history and her dedication \nto seeking ongoing psychological and psychiatric services. Applicant\u2019s CRNP-PMH told \nthe evaluator that Applicant is compliant with her treatment plan, and that she has no \nreservations about Applicant\u2019s judgment and reliability. (GE 2) \nThe evaluator concluded that Applicant\u2019s depressive symptoms were not under \ncontrol and described her as \u2018minimally stable\u2019 under the medical protocol she was \nfollowing at the time. The evaluator determined that Applicant\u2019s degree of functioning \nwas inadequate. Applicant, the evaluator explained, continued to struggle with stress, \nemployment worries, financial issues, and parenting, and that she did not have the \ncoping skills to prevent future decompensation.

The evaluator ultimately concluded that Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, stability, \nand trustworthiness in safeguarding classified information were poor. (GE 2) \nApplicant\u2019s CRNP-PMH wrote a rebuttal to the DOD evaluation. Applicant\u2019s \npractitioner has been treating her since 2012. The CRNP-PMH explained that her \nprimary role is the pharmacological treatment and management of Applicant\u2019s major \ndepressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. Applicant takes oral medications \nto treat the symptoms associated with these conditions. Because there is no FDA \napproved medication for borderline personality disorder, the symptoms are treated with \npsychotherapy, which Applicant has been doing consistently since at least 2018. (AE L) \nThe CRNP-PMH explained that Applicant\u2019s depression is treatment resistant, \nwhich is defined as \u201cexperiencing incomplete remission of symptoms with at least two \nantidepressants with trials of greater than four weeks of adequate treatment dose.\u201d The \ngoal of treatment is not complete remission of symptoms but symptom reduction and \nmanagement to prevent worsening of symptom presentation. Approximately 30% of \nadults diagnosed with major depressive disorder are treatment resistant. The diagnosis \nis not uncommon. Applicant, who is compliant with her treatment plan has not required \nhospitalization since May 2018. (GE l) \nThe CRNP-PMH also took exception with DOD evaluator\u2019s classification of \nApplicant\u2019s symptoms, which seem to give significant weight to one particular symptom \n- suicidal ideation, with a plan. The CRNP-PMH explains that suicidal ideation is one of \nthe nine diagnostic criteria of Major Depressive Disorder \u2013 none of which are weighted. \nIn other words, none of the nine diagnostic symptoms are more serious than any other. \nSuicidal ideation, even with a plan, is a common symptom experienced by individuals \ndiagnosed with major depressive order. (GE L) \nThe NP offered the following assessment of Applicant: \nAs her treatment provider for over 11 years. I fundamentally disagree with \nthe assessment of the evaluator that [Applicant] has a poor ability to \nsafeguard \nclassified \ninformation, \nas \nevidenced \nby \n[Applicant\u2019s] \ndemonstrating honesty, candor, and thoroughness in the process of \nobtaining a security clearance. (GE L) \nThe CRNP-PMH gave Applicant a favorable prognosis because of her voluntary \nadherence to her treatment plan. The CRNP-PMH acknowledges that, while Applicant\u2019s \nsymptoms are currently under control, they may be subject to recurrence or \nexacerbation, but that Applicant has sufficient insight to her illness, protective factors, and \ntherapeutic alliances to minimize symptom reoccurrence and had demonstrated the ability to \nvoluntarily seek a higher level of care should her symptoms worsen or become \nunmanageable.

As the long-standing treatment provider for \n[Applicant] for over 11 years with intimate knowledge of her character, \ntrustworthiness, judgement, and reliability I am unable to report any examples \nof [Applicant\u2019s] inability to follow orders or perform sensitive duties. \nIn conclusion, it is my professional opinion that despite a chronic mental health \ncondition which requires on-going \ntreatment, \n[Applicant] is stable, \ndemonstrates the judgement, reliability, stability, and trustworthiness to \nsafeguard classified information and perform sensitive duties. (GE L) \nApplicant understands the seriousness of her conditions and the importance of \nmaintaining her treatment plan. At hearing, she articulated that without her medical \ntreatment her mental state would be much worse. As a result, she has put safeguards in \nher personal life. Her mother, whom she relies on for emotional support, lives with Applicant \nand her family. During periods of difficulty, Applicant and her husband have a system in \nplace, whereby he handles medication as an extra level of safety. (Tr. at 87-90; GE 2; AE \nL) \nThe record contains other letters from individuals who have known Applicant in \nher academic, professional, and private lives. Each letter describes a person who is \nopen and honest about her medical issues. None have observed any behavior that \nraises questions about her judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness. (AE C-E, H) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nAn applicant\u2019s mental health becomes a concern when \u201c[c]ertain emotional, \nmental, and personality conditions can impair judgement, reliability, or trustworthiness. \nA formal diagnosis is not required for there to be a concern under this guideline.\u201d (AG \u00b6 \n27) The SOR alleges that Applicant has been receiving treatment for major depressive \ndisorder, general anxiety disorder, and borderline personality disorder since at least \n2012. As a result of these conditions, she has participated in at least two intensive \noutpatient treatment programs and has had two voluntary hospitalizations. A \npsychologist retained by DOD to perform an evaluation concluded that Applicant has a \ncondition that could negatively impact her judgment and ability to protect classified \ninformation. The following psychological conditions disqualifying conditions apply: \nAG \u00b6 28(b) an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that \nthe individual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, \nor trustworthiness; and, \nAG \u00b6 28(c) voluntary or involuntary inpatient hospitalizations. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nBased on the record, the following mitigating conditions apply: \nAG \u00b6 29(a) the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, \nand the individual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance \nwith the treatment plan; and \nAG \u00b6 29(c) recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional \nemployed by, or acceptable to and approved by, the U.S. Government, \nthat an individual\u2019s previous condition is under control or in remission, and \nhas a low probability of recurrence or exacerbation.  \nApplicant has demonstrated a 12-year history of compliance with her treatment \nplans, which includes daily medication as well as regular individual counseling. Her \ntreatment plan also includes more intensive treatment to include outpatient treatment \nprograms, voluntary hospitalization, and more frequent counseling as needed. \nThe DOD evaluator\u2019s conclusion that Applicant\u2019s degree of functioning is \n\u2018inadequate\u2019 and that she is \u2018minimally stable\u2019 under her current medical protocol is \ninconsistent with the record. Since high school, Applicant has managed her depressive \nsymptoms. She graduated college with honors, while balancing the demands of a \nchallenging academic course of study with work and extracurricular activities. She \nbecame a professional who has managed stressful work environments in serious safety \nand regulatory environments with the demands of a young family. She has no history of \nincidents at work related to her inability to manage her medical conditions. Conversely, \nthe record establishes that Applicant has complied with the requirements of her \nemployers when she is having acute medical issues. \nBased on the information in the record, I have no doubts about Applicant\u2019s \nsecurity worthiness. Applicant has a medical condition that is treatment resistant. Her \nsymptoms will not go into remission but can be largely managed. Her diagnoses will \nrequire lifetime attention to which she is committed. She is well aware of the role \nconsistent and vigilant medical care plays in maintaining her stability. She has also \nshown good judgment by taking time as needed to address her medical concerns \nvoluntarily, even if that means stepping away from her employment or submitting herself \nto hospitalization. I am confident that she will continue to follow her prescribed treatment \nplan and seek addition help during periods of acute illness. She has not engaged in any \nbehavior that suggests she would be able to perform the duties required of a clearance \nholder. \nApplicant has spoken honestly and openly about her medical conditions and their \neffect on her daily life. She has not attempted to minimize the seriousness of her illness \nor her need for consistent treatment. I find that she is more likely than not to report \nadverse information about her health as required. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Psychological Conditions  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.e:  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant Applicant a security clearance.

Department Counsel was ready to proceed on April 26, 2024, \nand the case was assigned to me on July 9, 2024. On July 12, 2024, the Defense Office \nof Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was scheduled to be \nconducted by video teleconference on August 6, 2024. I convened the hearing as \nscheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 10 were admitted in evidence without \nobjection. Applicant testified but did not present the testimony of any other witnesses or \nsubmit any documentary evidence. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on August 20, \n2024. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations in the SOR, with \nexplanations. His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 64-year-old project lead for a defense contractor involved with cruise \nmissiles. He was hired in December 2023 but was placed on leave without pay, pending \na decision on his security clearance. (Tr. 16-17). \nApplicant enlisted in the U.S. Navy in June 1984, when he was 24 years old. He \nserved on active duty until September 2004, and he retired as a chief petty officer (pay \ngrade E-7). He received a security clearance in December 2003. He has worked for \nfederal contractors since February 2014. \nApplicant married in August 1981, divorced in March 1992, married in September \n2005, and divorced in April 2021. He has three adult children. \nApplicant started consuming alcohol when he was 15 years old, drinking one or \ntwo beers a year until he was about 20 years old. From ages 21 to 25, he occasionally \ndrank five or six beers in one sitting. He then stopped drinking for five years. At age 30, \nhe began drinking beer three or four times a week. (Tr. 18-19) \nIn July 1991, while Applicant was on active duty in the U.S. Navy, he was cited for \ndrunk driving and received nonjudicial punishment for violation of Article 111, Uniform \nCode of Military Justice. This incident occurred while he was stationed overseas and \ndriving a military vehicle. He testified that the culture in his Navy unit at that time \nencouraged heavy drinking while on duty and off duty. (Tr. 20) He was hit by a dump trunk \nand ran into a pile of sand. His punishment was restriction to the Naval station for 30 \ndays, 15 days of extra duty, forfeiture of $150 pay per month for two months, and \nreduction from petty officer second class to petty officer third class. The reduction was \nsuspended for six months. (GX 9; GX 10) He was ordered to attend a one-week \ncounseling program. (GX 4 at 14) \nDuring an interview with a security investigator in March 2022, Applicant \nvolunteered information that he admitted himself for counseling in February 2001.

He and his second wife had decided to separate, and he realized \nthat he was spending large sums of money on beer. He contacted an outpatient \ncounseling service offered by the Navy, and he reduced his drinking to one or two drinks \nevery few weekends at social gatherings. (Tr. 27-30) \nIn January 2014, Applicant moved to another location. He had no family or friends \nat his new location, and he started drinking again at a bar operated by a veterans\u2019 \norganization. (Tr. 31) He was unable to work in his specialty because of a reduction in \nforce. In May 2014, he was arrested and charged with driving while intoxicated, first \noffense, with a blood-alcohol content of .15-.20%. He estimated that he had consumed \nsix to eight beers and two shots of hard liquor. (Tr. 33) He was convicted of reckless \ndriving, fined, and ordered to attend 12 weeks of alcohol-education classes. (GX 4 at 12; \nGX 7) He was diagnosed with an alcohol abuse disorder. (Tr. 36) He was ordered to \nattend Alcoholic Anonymous (AA) meetings. He completed all the court-ordered \nrequirements. (Tr. 36-37) He testified that he stopped drinking for about a year and a half. \nWhen he resumed drinking, it was limited to one or two drinks. (Tr. 40) \nApplicant moved again in February 2015. He drank moderately until 2018, when \nhe increased his drinking to three to six beers every other day. (Tr. 44) In November 2020, \nApplicant was arrested and charged with attempting to drive a vehicle while impaired by \nalcohol. He had consumed eight to ten beers at a music festival and two shots of hard \nliquor, and he rear-ended a car that was stopped at a red light. (Tr. 46) The driver of the \ncar he hit was hospitalized and filed a claim for personal injury that was paid by Applicant\u2019s \ninsurance company. (Tr. 47) \nApplicant pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 60 days in jail (suspended), placed \non probation for two years, and ordered to attend alcohol-education classes and obtain \ncounseling. (GX 6) He received counseling at least twice a week for 12 weeks, usually \nonline because of COVID-19. He completed the required 12 weeks of counseling in \nAugust 2021. (Tr. 49-50) The counselor apparently made an impression on Applicant, \nbecause when he was asked at the hearing how many sessions he had with the \ncounselor, he smiled and commented, \u201cLove that lady. Love that lady.\u201d (Tr. 49) He testified \nthat he did not believe he was diagnosed with an alcohol use disorder. There is no \ndocumentary evidence in the record reflecting the counselor\u2019s findings or diagnosis, if \nany. \nApplicant was required to have an interlock device on his vehicle for 12 months. \nDue to an administrative mistake, the interlock was not removed until 18 months later. He \nhad no interlock violations. (Tr. 60-61) \nApplicant attended AA meetings once or twice a week. He did not have a sponsor, \nbut he befriended two other attendees at the AA meetings.

He testified, \u201cI \nkind of gave up hope.\u201d (Tr. 52) \nApplicant has not consumed alcohol since his arrest in November 2020. (Tr. 55) \nWhen he was asked why he did not seek additional treatment or counseling, he answered: \nProbably because I had gotten so aggravated and angry with myself that I, \nI just decided I am not going to be drinking again ever for the rest of my \nlife. This is enough of this stupidness. And I just kind just threw alcohol out \nof my life. I\u2019m around people that drink sometimes, but I have no desire to. \nI just don\u2019t want anything to do with it anymore.  \n(Tr. 53) \nApplicant testified that he believes that his career is \u201cpretty well at an end after 47 \nyears.\u201d He has sold his house and moved to another state to live with his son. He believes \nthat it is time to get back to where his family and children live. He has reestablished \ncontact with his second wife, and they communicate \u201cpretty much daily.\u201d He believes that \nhe is \u201cin a happy place\u201d living near his family. (Tr. 57-58) When Department Counsel \nasked him why the Government should believe that he will not resume his old drinking \nhabits, he responded, \u201cIt's just caused too many headaches and I don\u2019t foresee myself \ngoing back to that vomit pool. It\u2019s just a bad place to go. And I don\u2019t want anything to do \nwith it. And it\u2019s, it\u2019s just like a bad piece of liver. You don\u2019t want it again.\u201d (Tr. 60) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nclassified information.

Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan at 531. Substantial \nevidence is \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to \nsupport a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d See ISCR \nCase No. 17-04166 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 21, 2019) It is \u201cless than the weight of the \nevidence, and the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence \ndoes not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d \nConsolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966). \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d \nis \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area \nTransit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a nexus or \nrational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed therein and \nan applicant\u2019s security suitability. ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the\nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition,\nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan at 531.  \nAnalysis \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 21:\u201d Excessive alcohol \nconsumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure to control \nimpulses and can raise questions about an individual's reliability and trustworthiness.\u201d \nThe following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nAG \u00b6 22(a): alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while \nunder the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, \nor other incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder; \nAG \u00b6 22(b): alcohol-related incidents at work, such as reporting for work or \nduty in an intoxicated or impaired condition, drinking on the job, or \njeopardizing the welfare and safety of others, regardless of whether the \nindividual is diagnosed with alcohol use disorder; and \nAG \u00b6 22(c): habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder. \nAll three disqualifying conditions are established. Applicant was punished for drunk \ndriving in July 1992 for an incident that occurred while he was on duty. The arrests in May \n2014 and November 2020 occurred when he was off duty. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 23(a): so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment;  \nAG \u00b6 23(b): the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations; and \nAG \u00b6 23(d): the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established pattern \nof modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations. \nAll three mitigating conditions are established. Applicant\u2019s alcohol-related incidents \nwere frequent and did not occur under unusual circumstances, but they were separated \nby long periods of time and have not recurred for almost four years. His first incident was \nin July 1991, followed 23 years later by an incident in May 2014, and followed by an \nincident in November 2020, a little more than six years later. Three years have passed \nsince he completed his probation. \nApplicant has received counseling on several previous occasions, to no avail. \nHowever, his most recent court-ordered counseling apparently has been effective. Four \nfactors may explain the difference. First, his conduct in November 2020 was the only time \nthat his alcohol use injured another person. Second, he seemed to have had a rapport \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwith his most recent counselor (\u201cLove that lady!\u201d). Third, he has matured and realized that \nthere is more to life than working and drinking. Fourth, he has moved from a solitary \nlifestyle with no support structure to one where he is surrounded by family. \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \u201cCriminal activity creates \ndoubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it \ncalls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations.\u201d \nThe relevant disqualifying condition in this case is AG \u00b6 31(b): \u201c[E]vidence \n(including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an admission, and matters of official \nrecord) of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the individual was formally charged, \nprosecuted, or convicted.\u201d \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially relevant: \nAG \u00b6 32(a): so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior \nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances, that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \nAG \u00b6 32(d): there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not \nlimited to, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, \nrestitution, compliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or \nhigher education, good employment record, or constructive community \ninvolvement. \nBoth mitigating conditions are established, for the reasons set out in the above discussion \nof Guideline G. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines G and J in my whole-person \nanalysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Applicant was candid, sincere, \nremorseful, and credible at the hearing. He served honorably in the U.S. Navy. He has \nheld a security clearance for more than 20 years, apparently without incident. After \nweighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines G and J and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nmitigated the security concerns raised by his alcohol consumption and criminal conduct. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption): \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J (Criminal Conduct): \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nClearance is granted. \nLeRoy F.

He graduated from high school in 2012 and attended college for about three years but did not earn a degree. He and his wife married in November 2019 and they now have an infant child.

Applicant began preparing the police report but put the money in the trunk of his squad car when he got another call. He then said he forgot about it, so the $250 remained there for 8-12 months. When he later found the money, he decided to keep it, instead of turning it in. He said this was because no one had asked about it. He later spent the money.

He did not provide sufficient evidence to mitigate the resulting \npersonal conduct security concerns. Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted security clearance applications (SCA) in September 2020 \nand May 2022. On May 12, 2023, following a background investigation, the Defense \nCounterintelligence and Security Agency Consolidated Adjudication Services (DSCA \nCAS) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), alleging security concerns under \nGuideline E, personal conduct. The CAS issued the SOR under Executive Order (Exec. \nOr.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on May 18, 2023, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). The \ncase was assigned to me on March 5, 2024. On March 25, 2024, DOHA issued a notice \nscheduling the hearing for April 17, 2024, by video-teleconference through an online \nplatform. \nApplicant\u2019s hearing convened as scheduled. Department Counsel submitted \nGovernment\u2019s Exhibits (GE) 1 through 3, all admitted without objection. Applicant and \nthree witnesses testified. He did not submit any exhibits during his case, but I held the \nrecord open after the hearing to allow him the opportunity to do so. He subsequently \nsubmitted four annual performance appraisals, from 2020 through 2023 (Applicant \nExhibits (AE) A through D) as well as 17 documents regarding training, education, \nsecurity briefings, responsibilities, and qualifications for his job as an assistant facility \nsecurity officer (AFSO) for his employer. These documents are marked together as AE \nE. All of Applicant\u2019s post-hearing exhibits are admitted without objection. DOHA \nreceived the hearing transcript (Tr.) on April 3, 2024.The record closed on April 24, \n2024.  \nAmendment to the SOR \nAs originally written, SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c all concerned Applicant\u2019s October \n2019 resignation from the police department of City A during an ongoing internal \ninvestigation into his conduct (1.a, 1.b, and 1.c), due to alleged unsatisfactory \nperformance (1.b) and neglect of duty (1.c). \nThe parties agreed that only one resignation was involved. Therefore, on my own \nmotion, I amended the SOR at the start of the hearing to delete SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b, \nand to amend SOR \u00b6 1.c. The amendment was accepted without objection. (Tr. 11-15) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c now reads as follows: \n1.c: In about October 2019, you resigned from your employment with [the \nCity A police department] during an ongoing Internal Affairs Bureau (IAB) \ninvestigation regarding your unsatisfactory performance and neglect of \nduty for failing to turn in about 42 reports and failing to turn in evidence.  \nFindings of Fact  \nIn his Answer to the original SOR allegations, Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.f \nwith narrative explanations.

(GE 3 at 6) \nIn October 2019, Applicant was questioned by IAB about various incidents \ninvolving missing reports and missing evidence, including this incident. He admitted \nspending the money and not filing the required paperwork. He said he was placed on \nprobation and that his police equipment was confiscated. He resigned from the PD \nabout a week and a half later by submitting a letter to the police chief. (GE 3 at 6) \nAfter that, Applicant was unemployed until February 2020, when took a job with \nstore. He worked there until August or September 2020, when he began working for his \ncurrent employer, a defense contractor. (GE 1, GE 2) Applicant began with his current \nemployer as a painter.

(Tr. 40-42) He has regular access to classified material and the employer\u2019s \nclassified facility (SCIF). (Tr. 115-116) \nApplicant submitted an SCA in September 2020. In discussing his departure from \nthe PD and his resulting unemployment, he stated that: \nI was not satisfied with my current job. Police work was not what I wanted \nto pursue as a career after I was in for two years. I was already in the \nworks of looking for another opportunity. I did not have the resum\u00e9 \nnecessary to jump into another profession. . . .

In answer to a question under the \u201cReceived Discipline or \nWarning,\u201d heading, Applicant answered \u201cYes,\u201d and reported that in about May 2019, he \nhad been \u201cwarned due to the lack of completing paperwork.\u201d (GE 2 at 16; Tr. 107-108) \nApplicant had a background interview in October 2020.

(GE 3 at 6; 108-109) (SOR \u00b6 1.e) \nApplicant also said that he was uncertain if he was eligible for rehire by the PD, \nbecause when he left the job, he was under investigation by internal affairs (IAB).

Since the IAB investigation was ongoing, he did not know the \noutcome when he resigned, and did not know if he would have been fired. This was why \nhe did not list his departure on his SCA (in answer to the \u201cReason for Leaving\u201d question \non GE 2). He had no further contact with anyone from the City A PD after he left. (GE 3 \nat 6) Applicant testified that he disclosed the matter in his background interview before \nbeing confronted about it.

He later \ntook a position in his employer\u2019s facility security office, for which he needs a top-secret \nclearance. (Tr. 69-70) He therefore submitted a second SCA, in May 2022. (GE 1) His \nexplanation for leaving the PD (\u201cTo pursue another career opportunity\u201d) and his \nnarrative explanation for his resulting unemployment were unchanged, word for word, \nfrom what he had reported on GE 2.

SOR \u00b6 1.g also alleges that Applicant failed to disclose \ncertain oral and written reprimands. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.e, and 1.f). However, as discussed \nbelow, since the IAB investigation was ongoing when he left the PD, his answer of \u201cNo\u201d \nto this question was true.

(Tr. \n113-114) \nApplicant had a second background interview in June 2022 and a third interview \nin September 2022. According to his authenticated June 2022 interview summary, he \nvolunteered that, while he was employed with the City A PD, he was investigated by \nIAB. The investigation was ongoing when he left. He verified his listed reason for \nleaving the job. He was being investigated for not turning in reports and \u201cfor there being \nno resolution to a call for some found money being turned in that [Applicant] had picked \nup.\u201d He said he was not disciplined, was not terminated, and did not leave following \ncharges or allegations of misconduct or after receiving notice of unsatisfactory \nperformance. The incident was fully discussed in his earlier interview and there were no \nsubsequent updates. (GE 3 at 13; Tr. 79) \nIn Applicant\u2019s third interview, in September 2022, he was confronted about \nreceiving an oral reprimand and a written reprimand, both in April 2019, from his \nsupervisor, Sgt.

In June 2018, he was called to a retail store after an employee had found a bag \nof marijuana and called police to turn it in. Applicant called the incident in to \nheadquarters, but did not finish the report, and later threw the marijuana away. He said \nhe did so to save time and because no offender was involved. (GE 3 at 15) He was \nnever aware of or read a specific \u201cverbatim\u201d policy prohibiting this, but said if there were, \nhis actions violated it. (Tr. 125-126) The second incident (discussed above), concerned \nthe $250 turned in by the store patron, money that Applicant took possession of, stored \nin his squad car, forgot about for months, and then spent it when he found it, instead of \nturning it in. He acknowledged being \u201cselfish,\u201d violating his fiduciary duty as a police \nofficer, and committing a crime in doing so. (GE 3 at 16; Tr. 99-102, 119-124) \nIn this third interview, Applicant also acknowledged throwing away a shell casing \nafter an incident involving \u201cshots fired.\u201d No additional details on this incident were \nprovided. (GE 3 at 16) During his testimony, Applicant said \u201cI was asked about that \nsituation, because it had happened,\u201d but he did not recall or offer any details during his \nhearing. (Tr. 106) \nApplicant agreed with the information he was confronted about. He said he would \nforget to start reports due to the workload, and admitted that he would not turn them in. \nHe said he understood that rules and regulations must be followed. He said he had \nissues with maturity when he was a police officer and has learned from his mistakes. \n(GE 3 at 16-17) \nApplicant reiterated during the September 2022 interview that he resigned from \nemployment with the City A PD because he was unhappy and left to pursue other \ncareer opportunities. He was aware of the IAB investigation for the 42 missing or unfiled \nreports, but said he was not fired and said he did not leave because he was under \ninvestigation. (GE 3 at 17) He said he knew that failing to complete or turn in reports \nwas against department policy. He said he did not list the IAB investigation or the \nmissing reports on his SCA because he was not reprimanded for any of the issues. He \ndenied having been placed on probation or having his police equipment confiscated \nafter it was discovered that he failed to turn in (and then spent) the $250. (GE 3 at 17) \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted resigning from the PD while under \ninvestigation by IAB but said he did so because he was unhappy and no longer wanted \nto work there. He acknowledged failing to turn in 42 reports over a two-year period, and \nsaid this was because he was young, irresponsible, and overworked. He acknowledged \nthrowing evidence in the trash, because \u201cI had discretion over misdemeanor \npossessions of substances therefore I just threw it away. I never used or gained from \nthe evidence that was not turned in.\u201d He was counseled for failing to turn in reports and \nsigned an acknowledgement.

However, he also \nsaid he did not recall receiving written reprimands and recalled only that he interacted \nwith his supervisor and sergeant. (Tr. 82-87) Yet he acknowledged an April 2019 written \nreprimand for failing to turn in reports, as alleged and as referenced in GE 3. (Tr. 106-\n107; GE 3 at 15) \nApplicant said in his Answer that when he filled out his second SCA (GE 1), he \nused the previous questionnaire and \u201cassumed it was ok to use the existing information \nand that all that was disclosed for my Secret clearance would automatically be in my \nfile. I thought that disclosing the information to the investigators would suffice.\u201d He did \nnot intend to withhold information. He did not know the specific reprimands or the dates \nthey were given. He was counseled by his direct supervisor. He was told he could \nexplain the information to the investigators, which he did.

He acknowledged not turning in 42 reports, as alleged. \nThe reports concerned matters such as interactions with citizens, crimes, and possible \ncrimes. He said he never discarded any reports, he just failed to complete them, usually \ndue to forgetfulness and being overwhelmed by the paperwork as a young police officer. \nHe acknowledged throwing evidence away, when he determined not to file charges \nagainst an individual, such as for juveniles smoking marijuana. It was easier to call their \nparents than to take them into custody, which was at his discretion. He acknowledged \nthat it was against policy to discard evidence and said he did so out of convenience. He \ndenied any \u201cmalicious intent.\u201d He said he did this because it would have involved \u201ca lot \nof time-consuming paperwork\u201d and it was easier to discard\u201d the evidence in such cases. \nHe said he was supposed to finish his reports by the end of his shift.

As the \nSupreme Court has held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.

This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nAnalysis \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative proceedings. . . \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and  \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, \nwhen combined with all available \ninformation, supports a whole-person assessment of questionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, \nlack \nof \ncandor, \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly \nsafeguard classified or sensitive information.

Such conduct \nincludes:  \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing.  \nWhile working as a young police officer for City A between 2017 and 2019, \nApplicant had a difficult time keeping up with the paperwork and bureaucratic \nrequirements that came with the job. He failed to complete and/or submit required police \nreports on about 40 occasions. He acknowledged discarding or throwing away \nevidence, including of uncharged misdemeanor marijuana offenses, often involving \njuveniles. Applicant had discretion not to issue citations in such cases, but he belatedly \nrecognized the need for proper and complete documentation. On one occasion, he took \ncustody of about $250 that a store patron had found and turned in, but then forgot about \nit for months. When he found the money in his squad car months later, he kept it and \nspent it instead of turning it in at the precinct. \nApplicant was counseled about his record-keeping and evidence collection by his \nsupervisor on several occasions in 2019. He asserted at various times that his \ncounseling sessions also involved reprimands or warnings, some oral and some written. \nNone of the written reprimands themselves are in the record. However, Applicant \ndisclosed at least one warning, which he reported on his first SCA, in 2020. \nI find that the April 2019 oral reprimand (SOR \u00b6 1.d) and the two alleged written \nreprimands, from May and April 2019 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.f, respectively) are sufficiently \nestablished by the record, specifically by Applicant\u2019s testimony that he was reprimanded \nby his supervising sergeant on multiple occasions. AG \u00b6 16(d)(1) and (3) apply to them. \nApplicant resigned as a police officer in October 2019. By this time, he was under \ninvestigation by IAB and he knew it. He was also placed on probation, or was at least \nsuspended from street duty, and assigned a desk job at the precinct. The IAB \ninvestigation was ongoing when he resigned, and he never learned the result later. SOR \n\u00b6 1.c, as amended, is established. AG \u00b6 16(d)(1) and (3) apply. Applicant took $250 that \nwas turned over by an honest citizen. He took and later spent the money rather than \ndoing what he should have done and turned it in. He was under investigation by IAB for \nthat and other conduct.

Nor did he leave by \u201cmutual \nagreement\u201d following charges or allegations of misconduct or notice of unsatisfactory \nperformance. There were such allegations (and they were largely established), and he \nknew about them, but there was no established \u201cmutual agreement\u201d that he should \nleave the PD. Therefore, given the choices the question offered, Applicant\u2019s answer of \n\u201cNo\u201d to the \u201cReason for Leaving\u201d question on his 2022 SCA was true. SOR \u00b6 1.g is \nfound for Applicant. \nWhen Applicant reported the circumstances of his departure from the PD (in \naddressing his resulting period of unemployment) on both his 2020 SCA and 2022 SCA, \nhe indicated that he left the job because he was unsatisfied and wanted to pursue other \ncareer opportunities. This was probably true, but it was not the whole truth. He did not \ndisclose that he was also under investigation by the PD for poor performance and \nneglecting his duties when he resigned, something he unquestionably knew at the time. \nThere is no allegation in the SOR as to Applicant\u2019s lack of candor in reporting his \ndeparture from the PD in this way, so it cannot be considered as disqualifying conduct. \nHowever, it can be considered in weighing mitigation and Applicant\u2019s credibility, \nparticularly on the relevant issue of his departure from the PD. \nApplicant discussed the circumstances of his departure during his first \nbackground interview (2020) and gave the same answer, word for word, on his second \nSCA (2022) as he did on his first SCA. This suggests that, as Applicant claims, his \nsecond SCA was \u201crepopulated\u201d with answers from his first one. \nThe next question, \u201cReceived Discipline or Warning,\u201d asked: \nFor this employment, in the last seven (7) years, have you received a \nwritten warning, been officially reprimanded, suspended, or disciplined for \nmisconduct in the workplace such as a violation of security policy?  \nOn his 2020 SCA, in answer to this question, Applicant answered \u201cYes\u201d and \ndisclosed that he had been \u201cwarned due to the lack of completing paperwork.\u201d The \nanswer changed to \u201cNo\u201d on his 2022 SCA, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h. The fact that his \nanswer to the previous question on his 2022 SCA was identical to what he reported on \nhis 2022 SCA strongly suggests that Applicant changed his answer here. In doing so, \nhe gave no indication that he had received any warnings, reprimands, suspensions, or \nwas disciplined by the PD. While the written reprimands are not in the record, he \nacknowledged being counseled by his supervising sergeant (in about April or May \n2019). Yet Applicant also gave no indication that he was suspended or placed on \nprobation, at least during the IAB investigation, when he acknowledged having been \nremoved from patrols and assigned to desk duty. \nThe fact that Applicant answered \u201cYes\u201d to this question on a previous form, and \ndiscussed some of his warnings in his first background interview did not allow him to \nchange his answer to \u201cNo\u201d and thereby give no indication on his second SCA that he \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhad any issues when he was employed with the PD. He had a responsibility to be fully \ncandid on his second SCA and he was not. AG \u00b6 16(a) applies to SOR \u00b6 1.h. \nA security clearance investigation is not a forum for an applicant to split hairs or \nparse the truth narrowly. The government has a compelling interest in protecting and \nsafeguarding classified information. That compelling interest includes the government's \nlegitimate interest in being able to make sound decisions, based on complete and \naccurate information, about who will be granted access to classified information. An \napplicant who deliberately fails to give full, frank, and candid answers to the government \nin connection with a security clearance investigation or adjudication interferes with the \nintegrity of the industrial security program. ISCR Case No. 01-03132 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. \n8, 2002) \nAG \u00b6 17 sets forth potentially applicable mitigating conditions under Guideline E: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment of falsification before being confronted with the facts;  \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and  \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained \ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to \nalleviate the stressors, circumstances or factors that contributed to \nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such \nbehavior is unlikely to recur. \nApplicant disclosed one written warning on his 2020 SCA and discussed the \ncircumstances of his departure from the PD in his 2020 background interview. In that \ninterview, he disclosed that he had been under investigation by IAB when he left the job. \nHe discussed the incident where he failed to turn in the $250. He discussed no other \nwritten warnings beyond the one he disclosed on GE 2. He also said he had not been \notherwise suspended or disciplined as a result. This was clearly false, given the record \nof: (1) numerous other incidents where he failed to complete reports and to turn in \nevidence, incidents that came to light in his subsequent investigation and (2) the fact \nthat he had been suspended from patrol duty during the IAB investigation. \nDuring Applicant\u2019s June 2022 interview, he volunteered that he had been \ninvestigated by IAB for not turning in reports and for the incident regarding the $250. He \nsaid the investigation was ongoing when he left. It was not until September 2022 that \nApplicant was confronted about the full extent of his employment record with the PD. At \nthat point, he was confronted about numerous specific instances of failing to complete \nor fill out reports and to turn in evidence. \n14 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant said in his September 2022 interview that he did not list the IAB \ninvestigation or the missing reports on his SCA because he was not reprimanded for \nany of the issues. This is patently false, since it is clear that he was reprimanded by his \nsupervising sergeant for several instances of poor record-keeping at best. He was also \nsuspended or placed on \u201con the job\u201d probation (desk duty) during the IAB investigation. \nWhile these statements are not alleged as separate personal conduct allegations, they \ncan be considered in weighing mitigation because they undermine his credibility in that \nApplicant minimized his conduct on several occasions during the security clearance \nprocess. AG \u00b6 17(a) therefore does not fully apply. \nApplicant\u2019s actions as a police officer are rather dated. However, while in a \nposition of public service and a fiduciary position of public service he abused that trust, \nnot only by doing a poor job of record keeping and evidence management, but on one \noccasion by committing an act of theft by stealing $250. There are marked similarities \nbetween (1) the requirements of recordkeeping and management of evidence as a \npolice officer and (2) the requirements of recordkeeping and management of classified \ninformation and materials. Applicant has a history not only of poor recordkeeping and \nevidence management but also of misconduct. This history places a high burden on \nApplicant to show that he is a suitable candidate for access to classified information \u2013 \nparticularly as an AFSO, a position in which he is tasked with handling and protection of \nclassified information and materials on a daily basis, including with proper \ndocumentation. \nI credit Applicant\u2019s documented trainings for his position and the testimony of his \ncharacter witnesses attesting to his judgment, trustworthiness, and reliability. However, \nnotwithstanding this evidence, it is difficult to conclude that Applicant is fully and \nsufficiently rehabilitated at this time, given his lack of candor about the full \ncircumstances of his departure from the PD on his 2022 SCA. He has not shown that \nhis actions happened under such unique circumstances that they are unlikely to \nrecur and do not cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 17(c) and 17(d) do not fully apply. Applicant has not fully mitigated security \nconcerns about his personal conduct, concerning both his actions as a police officer and \nhis lack of candor about the full circumstances about his departure from that position \nduring the security clearance process. \n Whole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n15 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline E in my whole-person analysis. As noted, I considered Applicant\u2019s testimony, \ncharacter evidence, and the documentation of his trainings and certificates as a security \nmanager and as an AFSO. Applicant now better understands the problems with what he \ndid. But that evidence in mitigation must be balanced against his pattern of conduct, \nincluding work-related rule violations, lack of candor, and the risk of recurrence. \nApplicant\u2019s actions as a young police officer are themselves rather dated. But the \nsimilarities between the police and security requirements of compliance with rules, \nregulations, and documentation make Applicant\u2019s track record difficult to overcome. \nFurther, not until he is completely candid about the full circumstances of his departure \nfrom the PD and his actions, can he be considered rehabilitated and, perhaps, a better \ncandidate for access to classified information. Overall, the record evidence leaves me \nwith questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility for continued access to classified \ninformation. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nDeleted \nSubparagraphs 1.c-1.f:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational security interest of the United States to grant Applicant\u2019s access to classified \ninformation. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nBraden M. Murphy \nAdministrative Judge \n16 \n",

On May 28, 2024, the Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was scheduled \nto be conducted by video teleconference on June 12, 2024. I convened the hearing as \nscheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 4 were admitted in evidence without \nobjection. Applicant testified and submitted Applicant Exhibits (AX) A through D, which \nwere admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on June 25, 2024. \nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of the portions of \nthe Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), \npertaining to alcohol use disorder and the facts set out in a publication of the National \nInstitute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism entitled \u201cUnderstanding Alcohol Use Disorder.\u201d \n(Hearing Exhibit I) I took administrative notice as requested, without objection. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and \n1.b. He admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d in part and denied them in part. \nHis admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact.  \nApplicant is a 34-year-old software engineer employed by a defense contractor \nsince November 2016. He received a bachelor\u2019s degree in computer engineering in May \n2014. He worked for a state employer from January 2011 to May 2014, was unemployed \nfrom May to November 2014, worked for a non-federal employer from November 2014 to \nNovember 2015, and was unemployed from November 2015 until he was hired by his \ncurrent employer. He has never married and has no children. He received a security \nclearance while working for his current employer. \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges that in January 2010, Applicant was charged with public \nintoxication after consuming six to eight beers and attempting to walk home. SOR \u00b6 1.b \nalleges that in October 2012, Applicant was charged with urinating in public after \nconsuming beer and up to eight drinks at a bar. Applicant admitted both allegations and \ndisclosed his conduct in his SCA. Both charges were resolved by probation before \njudgment and community service. (Tr. 18-19) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c alleges that from September 2015 to at least July 2023, Applicant \nconsumed about six beers daily. He moved from his home state to another state in April \n2018 when he was promoted. He self-isolated due to COVID 19 and started having panic \nattacks. He increased his beer consumption from one or two beers a few times a week to \na six-pack every night. (Tr. 23) In late 2020, he consulted with his primary care doctor \nabout his increasing panic attacks, and his conversations with his doctor began to include \ndiscussion of his drinking. After cognitive tests confirmed his anxiety disorder and \nattention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), he began talk therapy in late 2021.

(GX 2 \nat 11) He provided the same information in response to DOHA interrogatories in July \n2023. (GX 2 at 4-5) \nApplicant moved back to his home state in November 2021. In June 2022, he \nstarted receiving therapy from a licensed clinical professional counselor (LCPC) for \nanxiety, alcohol use, and ADHD. The LCPC did not have concerns about Applicant\u2019s \nability to hold a security clearance so long as he continued receiving treatment for his \nanxiety and alcohol use. Applicant discontinued therapy in October 2022 because it was \nexpensive, and he wanted to find a provider who was closer to his home and would accept \nhis insurance. \nSOR \u00b6 2.a alleges that Applicant was evaluated by a licensed psychologist in \nOctober 2022 and diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder, that the psychologist \nopined that he would benefit from psychotherapy to address his use of alcohol to cope \nwith his anxiety, and that his prognosis was guarded due to lack of ongoing individual \ntherapy. This evaluation was conducted by a licensed psychologist at DCSA\u2019s request, \ndue to concerns about Applicant\u2019s use of alcohol and symptoms of anxiety. At the time \nhe was evaluated, he was receiving medication for ADHD. He told the psychologist that \nhe still had symptoms of anxiety, overthinking, and shortness of breath, and that he used \nalcohol at night \u201cto calm down, decrease anxiety, turn my mind off, and decrease the \nthoughts.\u201d (GX 3 at 3) The psychologist diagnosed him with alcohol use disorder, mild; \nADHD, unspecified; and generalized anxiety disorder. The psychologist concurred with \nthe LCPC\u2019s belief that there would be concerns about Applicant\u2019s judgment only if he \ndiscontinued treatment. The psychologist gave him a \u201cguarded prognosis, due to a lack \nof ongoing individual therapy.\u201d (GX 3) \nIn January 2023, Applicant resumed treatment with the LCPC, and he continued \nto have regular sessions at least once a month up to the date of the hearing. The LCPC \ndiagnosed Applicant with generalized anxiety disorder. She did not provide a prognosis. \n(AX A) \nWhen Applicant responded to DCSA interrogatories in July 2023, he disclosed that \nhe consumed six beers a day and consumed alcohol to the point of intoxication once a \nweek. (GX 2 at 3-5) He disclosed that he was currently receiving counseling and taking \nan anti-anxiety medication. (GX 2 at 8) At the hearing, he testified that he is now taking a \nmedication that has reduced his daily panic attacks to the point where they are rare. (Tr. \n29) He also testified that he last drank to the point of intoxication and passed out in March \n2024. Before March 2024, he was drinking to the point of blacking out about once a \nmonth. (Tr. 41-42)  \nNone of the medical professionals have advised Applicant to abstain completely \nfrom consuming alcohol. However, he testified that he stopped drinking completely about \nfour months before the hearing. He admitted that the hearing was part of the motivation \nto stop drinking, but that his decision was also motivated by his concern for his health, \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nhaving been warned by a friend who is a cardiac rehabilitation specialist.

Unlike the other medical \nprofessionals he has seen, the nurse practitioner is authorized to prescribe medications \nfor alcohol deterrence.

He has attended some Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings since July \n2023, but he did not find them helpful. (Tr. 59-60) He completed a four-hour drug and \nalcohol awareness class in June 2024.

As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information.

Applicant\u2019s excessive alcohol consumption is recent \nand was frequent until about four months ago. It did not occur under unusual \ncircumstances. \nAG \u00b6 23(b) is not fully established. Applicant has acknowledged his maladaptive \nalcohol use and has refrained from consuming alcohol for about four months. He is \nreceiving regular counseling from medical professionals for his anxiety and ADHD and \nrecently has stopped consuming alcohol as self-medication for his psychological \nconditions. However, insufficient time has passed to establish a pattern of modified \nconsumption or abstinence. \nGuideline I, Psychological Conditions \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 27: \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair judgment, \nreliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is not required \nfor there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified mental health \nprofessional (e.g., clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) employed by, or \nacceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, should be consulted \nwhen evaluating potentially disqualifying and mitigating information under \nthis guideline and an opinion, including prognosis, should be sought. No \nnegative inference concerning the standards in this guideline may be raised \nsolely on the basis of mental health counseling. \nThe following disqualifying conditions under this guideline may be applicable: \nAG \u00b6 28(a): behavior that casts doubt on an individual's judgment, stability, \nreliability, or trustworthiness, not covered under any other guideline and that \nmay indicate an emotional, mental, or personality condition, including, but \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nnot limited to, irresponsible, violent, self-harm, suicidal, paranoid, \nmanipulative, impulsive, chronic lying, deceitful, exploitative, or bizarre \nbehaviors; and \nAG \u00b6 28(b): an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that \nthe individual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, \nor trustworthiness. \nAG \u00b6 28(a) is established. Applicant has been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder, \nADHD, and alcohol use disorder. He admitted that, until recently, he self-medicated with \nalcohol as a means of controlling his anxiety and panic attacks. He recognizes that his \nheavy drinking is unhealthy. \nAG \u00b6 28(b) is established. The psychologist and the LCPC who have treated \nApplicant have expressed reservations about his judgment if he discontinues his current \ntherapy program. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 29(a): the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, \nand the individual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance \nwith the treatment plan; \nAG \u00b6 29(b): the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment \nprogram for a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is \ncurrently receiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a \nduly qualified mental health professional; \nAG \u00b6 29(c): recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional \nemployed by, or acceptable to and approved by, the U.S. Government that \nan individual's previous condition is under control or in remission, and has \na low probability of recurrence or exacerbation; and \nAG \u00b6 29(e): there is no indication of a current problem. \nAG 29(a) is partially established. Applicant\u2019s anxiety and ADHD are readily \ncontrollable. Applicant has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with his \ntreatment plan for anxiety and ADHD. However, he admitted at the hearing that it is too \nsoon to tell if he can continue abstaining from alcohol. \nAG \u00b6 29(c) is not established. Applicant presented no evidence from a duly \nqualified mental health professional employed by or acceptable to and approved by the \nU.S. Government.  \nAG \u00b6 29(e) is established, to the limited extent that there has been no indication of \na problem within the past four or five months. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines G and I in my whole-person \nanalysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Applicant was sincere, candid, \nand credible at the hearing, but he admits that it is too soon to tell whether he can refrain \nfrom further maladaptive alcohol use. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating \nconditions under Guideline G and I and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the \nwhole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns under Guideline \nI raised by his anxiety disorder, but he has not mitigated the security concerns under \nGuideline G raised by his maladaptive alcohol use. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption): \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline I (Psychological Conditions): FOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

SOR \u00b6 1.b alleges that his former parents-in-law are \ncitizens and residents of China. \nApplicant met D, a Chinese national, from a dating website. In February 2018, she \ninitially contacted him, and her first question to Applicant was to ask who was his \nemployer. They eventually scheduled a first date.

He properly reported this information \nto his facility security officer (FSO) who advised him that he most likely would not be able \nto continue his employment if he maintained a relationship with an illegal alien. Applicant \nthen told D that he could not date her because she was in the country illegally, but D then \nreplied that she had been joking and showed him a green card. She asked Applicant to \nfix software on her laptop and also requested his assistance in improving her memory. \n(Tr. 37-38, 57-63, 65-67) \nApplicant thought it was strange that D reached out to him initially on the dating \nwebsite and that the first question she had asked him was about his employer. He also \nthought it peculiar that D claimed to be in the country illegally, but then stated she had \nbeen joking about it. He felt like she was testing him when she asked him to fix the \nsoftware issue on her computer. He also wondered if she had investigated his \nbackground. His concerns, not all of which were reported in this decision, were labeled \nas \u201cred flags.\u201d Applicant reported these red flags to his FSO, as required. (Tr. 37-38, 57-\n63, 65-67) \nWithin a month following their second date, Applicant and D were romantically \ninvolved. Another troubling incident occurred after they went to a party with D\u2019s co-\nworkers, and she became extremely intoxicated. Later that night while they were lying in \nbed together, he was discussing some business models and how people made money \nfrom using these models. D told him that her business model was to steal technology and \nsell it to the Chinese government. After making that alarming statement, she passed out. \nApplicant reported this red flag to his FSO, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) \nwas notified of this information. (Tr. 39-41, 68) \nIn about October 2018, three FBI agents showed up unannounced at Applicant\u2019s \nplace of employment. He agreed to work with these agents and report any other red flag \nbehaviors from D. Within two months he met with the FBI agents on about four occasions, \nand he reported approximately 40 red flags that made him suspect D was a Chinese spy. \nSome of the information he reported was that D had tried to recruit him to work as a \nsoftware engineer for China and told him he would be provided a house for free. He also \nsaw pictures of D on her phone wearing military fatigues. D had also been a member of \nthe People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA). After she completed her Chinese military service, D \ncame to the United States to study at a state university. She had used different dates of \nbirth on her Chinese passport and on her U.S. driver\u2019s license. She had attempted to log \ninto his cell phone. She sent him emails with attachments that had the Trojan virus which \ncould have potentially stolen his data, monitored his keystrokes, and enabled the use of \nhis computer\u2019s microphone and camera. He also discovered that she was taking \nmedication for a bipolar disorder. (Tr. 35-37, 55-57,70-72, 74-75; GE 3) \nThe FBI agents told Applicant that he should break ties with D, but they never \ndisclosed to Applicant whether they thought D was a Chinese spy. The FBI agents told \nhim that he was listed as D\u2019s sponsor to obtain U.S. citizenship. Applicant did not recall \nfilling out any sponsorship documents for D. He truly feared D was a risk to national \nsecurity. In December 2018, Applicant ended the relationship with D, and he moved to \nanother state. He received new employment as a contractor.

In \nabout April 2019 D contacted him and said she missed him and wanted to work on their \nrelationship. She also told him that she wanted to have a baby with him. At this point, \nApplicant testified that he no longer thought D was a Chinese spy because at some point \nthe FBI agents told him that a spy would never have a baby with their intended target. \nDuring his July 19, 2022 background interview, Applicant told the investigator that in the \nback of his mind, however, he still thought there was a possibility that D was a spy. (Tr. \n33-34, 41-42, 79-81; GE 3) \nIn April 2019 Applicant traveled to visit D. He did not tell the FBI agents about his \nplans to meet with her or their earlier conversation, and he did not report to his FSO about \nhis planned encounter with a Chinese national because, he said, \u201cit didn\u2019t occur\u201d to him. \nD got pregnant during this visit. In May 2019 she moved in with Applicant, which he \nreported to his FSO, and in June 2019 they were married. Although Applicant reported to \nhis FSO that D had moved in with him, he did not mention his misgivings about her being \na Chinese spy, or that he had worked with FBI agents concerning these suspicions at his \nprevious place of employment. (Tr. 42-44, 80-86; GE 3, 5) \nIn August 2019, two months after they married, Applicant reported to his FSO that \nhe believed his wife was a Chinese spy due to her \u201csolicitation\u201d and asking specific \nquestions about his work. New FBI agents from his current state of residence came to his \nplace of employment to discuss these concerns. The FBI barred Applicant\u2019s entry to his \ndesignated workspace because he was considered a risk to national security. Shortly \nthereafter, the federal contractor terminated Applicant\u2019s employment. He remained \nunemployed for one year and the marital relationship with D deteriorated. (Tr. 42-44, 80-\n86; GE 3, 5) \nIn January 2020, Applicant\u2019s son was born. Applicant stayed with D until July 2020, \nwhen he decided they should separate. The day before he left the marriage, D brought \nover a purported Ph.D. Chinese doctoral student who was specializing in a specific field. \nHe asked for Applicant\u2019s help in research methods in that field. Applicant was immediately \nsuspicious about this meeting because he is highly regarded in that field. He has made \nsignificant contributions in this field, and if he does not receive his DOD security \nclearance, he believes it would be detrimental to the U.S. interests. Applicant did not help \nthe Chinese student and he saw this incident as another red flag. (Tr. 44, 50-52, 74, 87) \nD\u2019s mother left China and came to the United States to help care for their son. \nAfter Applicant separated from D, he did not have any contact with D, his mother-in-law, \nor his son for about nine months. In about April 2021, D sent Applicant a text that said \nshe was going to harm their son. He picked up his son and maintained sole custody of \nhim for approximately eight months. He testified that as of January 2022, they share \ncustody of their son, who spends six months with one parent and then six months with \nthe other parent. They are currently trying to determine who will have custody of their son \nduring the school year. He believes D has remarried and that her new spouse lost his \nDOD security clearance based on a conversation Applicant overheard while Skyping with \nhis son.

He no longer worries about this issue \nsince the DOS has a system in place to prevent this type of situation and they have all of \nthe necessary information. (Tr. 86-96) \nIn April 2021, when Applicant started his new job with his current employer, he \nreported to his FSO and fully disclosed his relationship with his ex-wife. The FSO testified \nat the hearing as a witness. In May 2021, new FBI agents from his current state of \nresidence, as well as other government agents, met with Applicant for a period of \napproximately three days discussing details about his relationship with D. An FBI agent \ninformed Applicant that D was in the process of being deported in about early 2019. She \nmost likely called him and asked him to father a child with her in order to remain in the \nUnited States. The FSO also established a \u201cthreat mitigation plan,\u201d and stated that \nApplicant is fully compliant with this plan. After meeting with the FBI and other government \nagents, Applicant has reported to the FSO any concerns about his communications with \nD and her attempts to elicit information from him. Applicant last met with government \nagents approximately one year ago. (Tr. 18-29, 96-101; GE 3, 5) \nIn Applicant\u2019s April 2023 response to interrogatories, he listed that D has attempted \n(unsuccessfully) to elicit information from him by using their son as leverage. She \nrequested Applicant to discuss his thoughts about geopolitical current events, because \nwhatever he predicts ends up coming true, weeks, months, and even years later. She told \nhim if he would provide this information, she would not ask the court for child support. \n(GE 3) \nCharacter Evidence \nApplicant\u2019s current FSO recommended Applicant be granted a DOD security \nclearance because he self-reported, as required, his concerns about D, and he is fully \ncompliant with the threat mitigation plan. He is loyal to the United States, and he is not \nconsidered a threat to national security. In addition, a retired Admiral stated that Applicant \nfunctions as the federal contractor\u2019s authority in his field of expertise. If Applicant were to \nleave the company, the company would lose a critical share of its cutting-edge knowledge \nin that field. (Tr. 18-29; AE D) \nAdministrative Notice - China \nI take administrative notice of the facts set forth in the Administrative Notice \ndocuments concerning China, which are incorporated herein by reference. China is a \nlarge and economically powerful country, with a population of more than a billion people \nand an economy growing at about 10% per year. China has an authoritarian government, \ndominated by the Chinese Communist Party. It has a poor record with respect to human \nrights, suppresses political dissent, and engages in arbitrary arrests and detentions, \nforced confessions, torture, and mistreatment of prisoners. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nChina is one of the most aggressive countries in seeking sensitive and protected \nU.S. technology and economic intelligence. It targets the United States with active \nintelligence gathering programs, both legal and illegal. China is in direct competition with \nthe United States in many geopolitical and economic areas, and it is known to actively \ncollect military, economic and industrial information about the United States. In addition \nto being the leading threat to the security of U.S. technology, China of late has emerged \nas a persistent cyber espionage threat to U.S. military and critical infrastructure systems. \nMuch of that activity is conducted through the auspices of the PLA.  \nChina\u2019s focus is on obtaining U.S. information and technologies beneficial to its \nmilitary modernization and economic development. China\u2019s intelligence services, as well \nas private companies and entities, frequently seek to exploit Chinese citizens or persons \nwith family ties to China who can use their insider access to steal secrets. The PRC \nsometimes uses coercion or blackmail to manipulate its citizens overseas to conduct \ninfluence operations on behalf of China. Additionally, the PRC targets individuals in other \ncountries to support its acquisition of foreign technology; seeks to recruit individuals \nprimarily, but not exclusively, from relevant diaspora populations and recent emigrants \nfrom the PRC, as well as foreign national experts whose recruitment the PRC views as \nnecessary to its scientific and technical modernization, especially with regard to defense \ntechnology. As a result, it is a growing threat to U.S. national security. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline B: Foreign Influence \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 6 as follows: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, financial, and \nproperty interests, are a national security concern if they result in divided allegiance. They \nmay also be a national security concern if they create circumstances in which the \nindividual may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, \nor government in a way inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and interests \nshould consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest is located, including, \nbut not limited to, considerations such as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to \nobtain classified or sensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nFive disqualifying conditions under this guideline are relevant to this case: \n(a): contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n(c): Failure to report or fully disclose, when required, association with a \nforeign person, group, government, or country; \n(d): counterintelligence information, whether classified or unclassified, that \nindicates the individual\u2019s access to classified information or eligibility for a \nsensitive position may involve unacceptable risk to national security; \n(g): unauthorized association with a suspected or known agent, associate, \nor employer of a foreign intelligence; and \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(h): indications that representatives or nationals from a foreign country are \nacting to increase the vulnerability of the individual to possible future \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \nApplicant has continuing relationships with D, a foreign national, and their young \nson. Due to these relationships, D has leverage over Applicant which could create a \nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion \nunder AG \u00b6 7(a). Applicant has held longstanding concerns that D is a Chinese spy. That \nrelationship, combined with factual information about China and its relationship with the \nUnited States, and the record evidence as a whole, also require application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(c), \n7(d), 7(g) and 7(h). \nThe following mitigating conditions under this guideline are potentially relevant: \n(a): the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States; \n(b): there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest;  \n(c): contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; and \n(e): the individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements \nregarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, \ngroups, or organizations from a foreign country.  \nI considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s ties to China and the adversarial relationship \nChina has with the United States. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-03450 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. \n28, 2019). Because of that adversarial relationship, Applicant has a \u201cvery heavy burden\u201d \nof persuasion as to mitigation. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-04208 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 7, \n2019). In foreign influence cases, the nature of the foreign government and its \nintelligence-gathering history are important considerations. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-\n08412 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Sep. 11, 2015). \nI have carefully considered the fact that Applicant, D, and their son reside in the \nUnited States. It is important to note he does not have a relationship or any contacts with \nhis former Chinese parents-in-law, and this is no longer a security concern in this case. \nApplicant\u2019s relationship with D and his son, however, cannot be considered casual, and \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhis communications with them are continuing and consistent. Although Applicant\u2019s sense \nof loyalty to the United States and his ties in this country are significant, that information \nis not sufficient to outweigh the heightened risk of coercion presented by a Chinese \nnational Applicant married, divorced, and who he believed to be a Chinese spy. During \nthe hearing, Applicant stated that he may have exaggerated the facts and now sees there \nis a logical and reasonable explanation for D's behaviors that does not cause concerns \nfor national security. \nThe Administrative Notice documents report that China\u2019s intelligence services \nfrequently seek to exploit Chinese citizens who can use their insider access to steal \nsecrets. Applicant was initially very diligent in reporting information that could impact \nnational security, but he used extremely poor judgment and disregarded reporting \nrequirements in about April 2021. He received a communication from D, she said she \nwanted to have his baby, and he made immediate plans to meet with her. He should have \nreported to the FBI agents he had previously worked with about D\u2019s conversation and his \nplans to visit her. If he had, he may have discovered she was currently in the process of \ndeportation and having his baby was most likely her plan to remain in the United States. \nIn addition, he did not report to his current FSO, as required, that he was meeting with a \nChinese national because \u201cit didn\u2019t occur\u201d to him. After they were married, he was \nterminated from this employment because he was considered a risk to national security. \nD served in the Chinese military, and she is a member of PLA. There are too many \ntroubling behaviors in the record to dismiss D as a threat to national security. I find there \nremains a conflict of interest because D has leverage with their son, and Applicant should \nnever be placed into a position where he has to choose between his son and the \nprotection of U.S. classified information. Applicant has not met his \u201cvery heavy burden\u201d of \npersuasion, and the foreign influence security concerns are not mitigated. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct    \nAG \u00b6 15 describes the security concern about personal conduct as follows: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes.  \nAG \u00b6 16 lists two conditions, one that may not fit the facts of this case exactly, but \nthe essence of which still raises security concerns and may be disqualifying in this case: \n(c): credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information; and \n(e): personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual group. Such conduct includes: \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the \nperson\u2019s personal, professional, or community standing. \nApplicant married a Chinese national who he believed to be a Chinese spy. China\u2019s \nintelligence services frequently seek to use or exploit Chinese citizens who can use their \ninsider access to steal secrets. In about April 2019, Applicant failed to report adverse \ninformation about the Chinese national to the FBI and his current FSO, which showed \npoor judgment and an unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. Applicant and \nD, now divorced, have a son together. The above disqualifying condition applies. \nAG \u00b6 17 includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability.  \nApplicant has a child with D, a woman whom he believed, up until the hearing was \nconducted, was a Chinese spy. According to Applicant, D has used his son as leverage \nto elicit information from him in the past, and I find it likely she will continue to use his son \nas leverage in the future. He is regarded as an expert in a specific field, and China and \nthe U.S. are actively involved in this highly technological advancement and pursuit. I find \nApplicant to be an upstanding and loyal American, however, he used extremely poor \njudgment in this scenario, and has placed himself in a compromising position. Applicant \nwas compliant with required adverse information reporting until approximately April 2019. \nFollowing his termination from employment and subsequent divorce, he has purportedly \ncorrected his shortcomings and is now motivated to report all foreign national contacts \nthrough the use of a threat mitigation plan. However, his current prevention of such \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nproblems in the future does not preclude careful consideration of his security worthiness \nin light of his recent poor decision-making and irresponsible behavior. Protection of our \nnation\u2019s secrets remains paramount. Based on the evidence in the record, I find that \npersonal conduct security concerns are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guidelines B and E and \nthe factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) in this whole-person analysis. \nApplicant has shown himself to be a patriotic American citizen and a well-\nrespected contributor to the defense industry. Due to poor choices, he has placed himself \nin a precarious situation with a Chinese national he has long believed to be an active spy \nfor China. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility and a security clearance. For all these \nreasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the foreign influence and personal conduct \nsecurity concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a.:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b.:  \n \nFor Applicant \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_______________________ \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a.:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, I conclude \nthat it is not clearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

National security eligibility is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn April 21, 2023, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency \nConsolidated Adjudication Services (DCSA CAS) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \nto Applicant detailing security concerns under Guidelines H (drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse), and E (personal conduct).

(Item 1) On June 22, 2023, Department Counsel submitted a file of relevant \nmaterial (FORM) and provided a complete copy to Applicant. Department Counsel\u2019s \nFORM includes Items 1 through 5. After the receipt of the FORM, Applicant changed his \nmind and requested an appearance in person before a DOHA judge to present his case. \nHis request was dated July 4, 2023, and I marked it as Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2 and placed \nit in the record. DOHA issued a notice of hearing setting the hearing for November 28, \n2023.

In March 2020, he was employed \nby a government contractor as a laser physicist with a research and development group. \nIn November 2021, he submitted his resignation to his employer.

(SOR \u00b6 1.a) It also alleged that he purchased marijuana with varying frequency \nfrom January 2022 until June 2022. (SOR \u00b6 1.b) Applicant admitted these allegations with \nclarification. He testified that he smoked marijuana once in the Fall of 2011; he used \nmarijuana with varying frequency from about 2014 through 2017; and then he used \nmarijuana from about January 2022 through June 2022, while he was living in a state \nwhere marijuana use was legal under state law. He was not aware that the state law \nconflicted with federal law, and, in the context of DOD security clearances, that marijuana \nuse was considered illegal. He purchased marijuana from state-licensed vendors, and he \nused marijuana occasionally. He stated, \u201cUpon [my employment] resignation, I fully and \nhonestly believed my clearance ended with it.\u201d He also noted in his Answer, \u201cI have never \nonce seen or handled a classified document.\u201d (Answer; Tr. 24-25) \nApplicant explained that he did not undergo a full security clearance investigation \nor was involved in a background interview by the time he had resigned from his \nemployment in late 2021.

He indicated in his November 2020 SCA that he never intended to \nuse marijuana again. He was truthful when he wrote that because he was living in a state \nwhere marijuana use was illegal, and he assumed he would continue living in that state. \nAfter he moved to a different state in January 2022, he was asked by his current employer \nto reapply for a security clearance. In June 2022, Applicant conducted research and \nimmediately stopped his use of marijuana after he discovered that such use, even in a \nstate where it is legal, is still considered an illegal controlled substance under federal law. \nHe disclosed his marijuana use on his January 2022 SCA. Applicant adamantly denied \nthat he had been put on notice of the security significance of marijuana use when he \napplied for a security clearance in late 2020. As soon as he became aware of how federal \nlaw applied to him in a state where marijuana use is legal, his marijuana use ended. He \nhas not used marijuana since June 2022, and he does not intend to use it in the future. \n(Answer; Tr. 24-26, 31-33 36, 39-40; GE 1 and 2) \nIn August 2022, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized DOD investigator \nabout his listed use of marijuana on the June 2022 SCA. Applicant told the investigator \nthat he had used marijuana weekly to monthly from January 2022 to June 2022. He also \nexplained that he stopped his use of marijuana after he learned in June 2022 of the \napplication of federal law and the overall security significance of such use. He told the \ninvestigator that he did not know that his initial security clearance could continue from \none government contractor to the next. Applicant was remorseful about his recent use of \nmarijuana. (GE 1 and 3) \nIn August 2023, his employer\u2019s facility security officer sent to employees the Office \nof the Under Secretary of Defense memorandum \u201cGuidance Concerning Marijuana for \nAgencies Conducting Adjudications.\u201d Applicant provided this document as evidence to \nshow that it was sent to employees due to the confusion about marijuana use in a state \nwhich had legalized its use and the consequence to DOD security clearance holders living \nin those states. The Memorandum disclosed that government contractor employees are \nto refrain from marijuana use upon initiation of the national security and vetting process. \nApplicant contends that he has followed this guidance because he immediately stopped \nhis use of marijuana in June 2022, while he was under investigation by the U.S. \nGovernment. He discontinued his use of marijuana when he became aware of current \nfederal law and the overall security significance. (AE A; Tr. 26-31, 36) \nPersonal Conduct \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b were cross alleged under Guideline E.  \nCharacter Evidence \nApplicant testified that within three years, and just after he turned the age of 30, \nhe received three employment promotions.

He recommended Applicant be granted national security eligibility. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for drug involvement and substance \nmisuse is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances . . . can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may\nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises\nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules,\nand regulations.  \n \n \n \n \nI have considered the disqualifying conditions for drug involvement under AG \u00b6 25 \nand the following are potentially applicable: \n(a) any substance misuse; and \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia. \nApplicant used marijuana once in the Fall of 2011; he used marijuana with varying \nfrequency from about 2014 through 2017; and then he used and purchased marijuana \nfrom about January 2022 through June 2022, in a state where marijuana use is legal. I \nfind that AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(c) apply to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b. \nThe SOR alleged he used marijuana after he was granted a DOD security \nclearance in March 2021. Although Applicant held a security clearance that was granted \nin March 2021, there is no record evidence that he had access to classified information \nduring the times he used marijuana. He also noted in his Answer, \u201cI have never once \nseen or handled a classified document.\u201d Eligibility for access to classified information and \nthe granting of access to classified information are not synonymous concepts. They are \nseparate determinations. The issuance of a security clearance is a determination that an \nindividual is eligible for access to classified national security information up to a certain \nlevel. Security clearance eligibility alone does not grant an individual access to classified \nmaterials. In order to gain access to specific classified materials, an individual must have \nnot only eligibility (i.e., a security clearance), but also must have signed a nondisclosure \nagreement and have a \u201cneed to know.\u201d See ISCR Case No. 20-03111 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. \n10, 2022). I find that AG \u00b6 25(f), \u201cany illegal drug use while granted access to classified \ninformation or holding a sensitive position,\u201d is not established. \nI have considered the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand  \n(3) providing a signed a statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nThe crux of this case is that Applicant used and purchased marijuana from \nJanuary 2022 through June 2022, in a state that had legalized the use of marijuana. He \ndid not know that his use of marijuana violated federal law. In June 2022, after conducting \nresearch, he discontinued his marijuana use altogether once he learned that in the \ncontext of DOD security clearances, marijuana is considered illegal under federal law. He \ndecided then that he would never use marijuana again. \nApplicant was candid with his history of marijuana use during his security \nclearance investigation. I find he is sincere in his commitment to remain drug-free, and \nhe is unlikely to resume his use of marijuana or any other illegal substance. He has \nabstained from using marijuana for one-and-one-half years. He is doing well in his job \nand has been promoted three times in the last three years. Mitigating conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n26(a) and 26(b)(3) apply. Drug involvement and substance misuse security concerns are \nmitigated. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \nMy analysis under Guideline H addressed Applicant\u2019s use and purchase of \nmarijuana. The same issues were cross alleged under the personal conduct guideline. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNo specific personal conduct allegations were raised beyond what was already raised \nunder Guideline H. I have previously addressed the allegations and to do so under \npersonal conduct is redundant and unnecessary. I find for Applicant regarding personal \nconduct security concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guidelines H and E, to \ninclude the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d), in this whole-person analysis. \nThe federal government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and \nconfidence in persons granted access to classified information. In deciding whether to \ngrant or continue access to classified information, the federal government can take into \naccount facts and circumstances of an applicant's personal life that shed light on the \nperson's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. Furthermore, security clearance \ndecisions are not limited to consideration of an applicant's conduct during work or duty \nhours. Even if an applicant has a good work record, his off-duty conduct or circumstances \ncan have security significance and may be considered in evaluating the applicant's \nnational security eligibility. \nApplicant\u2019s illegal use of marijuana occurred under circumstances that are unlikely \nto recur. He has matured and is remorseful about his past involvement with marijuana. \nHe was forthright about his drug-related involvement and provided full details about his \nmarijuana use during his background interview with an authorized DOD investigator. He \nhas made positive changes in his life. Given the entirety of the record evidence, I conclude \nthat Applicant successfully mitigated the drug involvement and substance misuse and \npersonal conduct security concerns. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n______________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b.: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a.: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

(GEs 1-2) \nApplicant\u2019s finances \nApplicant struggled with the management of her finances for many years. In \nNovember 1992, she petitioned for Chapter 13 bankruptcy relief. (GE 5) Her petition \nwas dismissed. Bankruptcy records confirm that she petitioned for Chapter 7 bankruptcy \nrelief in May 1997; she attributed this petition to the medical expenses associated with \nthe birth of her two children. (GE 6; Tr. 27) Applicant petitioned again for Chapter 7 \nrelief in December 2007. (GE 7; Tr. 28) She attributed this filing to the joint desires of \nherself and her husband to clean up their debts. (Tr.29) In her petition, she scheduled \npersonal property valued at $18,581 and claimed no real property. (GE 7) For claims of \ncreditors, she scheduled $13,906 in secured claims, $725 in unsecured priority claims \n(i.e., state income taxes owed), and $86,130 in unsecured non-priority claims. (GE 7) \nFollowing each of her bankruptcy petitions, Applicant returned to accumulating \ndebt beyond her ability manage and control.

In 2023, health issues involving her father\u2019s diagnosed lung \ncancer necessitated her devotion of more time and resources to providing financial \nassistance and travel support to her parents. (AE Y; Tr. 22, 56) Pressures on her \nfinances increased following her three-month layoff from her non-profit employer in \n2021.

These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe AGs list guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision-making \nprocess covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that could \ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as \nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information, or to hold a position of trust. These guidelines include \nconditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying \nconditions), if any, and all of the conditions that could mitigate trust concerns, if any. \nThese guidelines must be considered before deciding whether or not a security \nclearance, or eligibility to hold a public trust position, should be granted, continued, or \ndenied. Although, the guidelines do not require judges to place exclusive reliance on the \nenumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a \ndecision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context \nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable trust risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \n5 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n  \n \n                                                     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \nFinancial Considerations \nThe Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts \nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules or regulations, all of which \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information.

AG \u00b6 18. \nBurdens of Proof \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information, or who hold public trust positions. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions \ninclude, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or \ninadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain \ndegree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of \ncompromise of classified information [and implicitly privacy information]. Eligibility \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nSee also Exec. Or. 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), \u00a7 3.1. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom holding a public trust position. The Government has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR.

Financial stability in a \nperson cleared to hold a public trust position is required precisely to inspire trust and \nconfidence in the holder of a public trust position that entitles the person to access to \nprivacy-protected information. While the principal concern of a public trust holder\u2019s \ndemonstrated financial difficulties is vulnerability to coercion, pressure, and influence to \nproduce protected privacy information, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in cases \ninvolving delinquent debts. \nHistorically, the timing of addressing and resolving debt delinquencies are critical \nto an assessment of an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment in \nfollowing rules and guidelines necessary for those seeking eligibility to hold a public \ntrust position. See ISCR Case No. 14-06808 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 23. 2016); ISCR Case \nNo. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015); ISCR Case No. 14-00221 at 2-5 (App. Bd. \nJune 29, 2016). \nAddressing Applicant\u2019s delinquent accounts, all of the listed debts in the SOR are \nsupported by Applicant\u2019s credit reports and acknowledgements in her PSI. Credit \nreports are business records that generally are sufficient to meet the Government\u2019s \nevidentiary obligations under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations (financial in \nthis case). See ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan 7, 2010). \nTo date, Applicant has not addressed most of the listed SOR debts with credible \ndocumentation. Of the listed SOR debts in this case, she has favorably resolved only \ntwo (and with very modest payment plans): SORs \u00b6\u00b6 1.p and 1.u. For the most part, she \nhas never documented any follow-up initiatives on the debts she acknowledged as her \nown in her 2022 PSI interview. Applicant\u2019s commitments (both in her PSI and SOR \nresponse) to address her still unresolved SOR debts that she can verify, while \nencouraging, represent no more than promises to resolve her still outstanding accounts \nwith promised payments and payment plans and are not viable substitutes for a track \nrecord of paying debts in a timely manner and otherwise acting in a responsible way. \nSee ISCR Case No. 17-04110 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 26, 2019) \nTo be sure, Applicant has had her share of personal struggles in her life with \nraising her children and caring for her second husband who suffered multiple strokes \nand could not help her with managing their finances for almost two years before their \nseparation More recently, she has been burdened with physical and financial demands \nimposed on her by her parents to help with her parents\u2019 household expenses with \nhelping her father and mother with their household expenses and transportation needs \nfollowing her father\u2019s cancer diagnosis. \nStill, more concerted debt payment initiatives could be expected of her with the \nincome resources available to her from her full-time employment. She acknowledged \noverspending as a source of her past financial troubles in her own testimony and has \nfailed to document any payment initiatives with the bulk of her creditors. Without more to \nshow for addressing her delinquent debts, none of the potentially available mitigating \nconditions can be applied to her situation at this time. \n8 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n          \n \n \n \n         \n \n \n                          \n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n__________________________ \nWhole-person assessment \nWhole-person assessment of Applicant\u2019s public trust eligibility requires \nconsideration of whether her debt delinquencies are fully compatible with minimum \nstandards for holding a public trust position. While Applicant is entitled to credit for her \nwork in the defense health industry and for the devotion she has shown in caring for her \nhusband and parents, her employment contributions and caretaking contributions are \nnot enough at this time to overcome her repeated failures or inability to address her \npayment responsibilities and exercise good financial judgment over the course of many \nyears. \nOverall trustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment have not been established. \nBased on a consideration of all of the facts and circumstances considered in this case, it \nis too soon to make safe predictions that Applicant will be able to undertake reasoned, \ngood-faith efforts to mitigate the Government\u2019s financial concerns within the foreseeable \nfuture. More time is needed for her to establish the requisite levels of stability with her \nfinances and restoration of trust, reliability, and good judgment necessary to establish \nher eligibility to hold a public trust position. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and \ncircumstances in the context of the whole person. I conclude financial considerations \npublic trust position concerns are not mitigated. Eligibility for holding a public trust position \nis denied. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nGUIDELINE (FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.o, 1.q-1.t, 1.v-1.z: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.p and 1.u:  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for holding a \npublic trust position.

Some areas have \nincreased risk. The Department of State has issued notices not to travel for the following \nareas in Lebanon: to the border with Syria due to terrorism and armed conflict; to the \nborder with Israel due to the potential for armed conflict; or to refugee settlements due to \nthe potential for armed clashes. \nLocal security authorities in Lebanon have noted a rise in violent crimes, including \npolitical violence. Multiple unsolved killings in Lebanon may have been politically \nmotivated. Terrorist groups continue plotting possible attacks in Lebanon. Terrorists may \nconduct attacks with little or no warning targeting tourist locations, transportation hubs, \nmarkets/shopping malls, and local government facilities. Kidnapping, whether for ransom, \npolitical motives, or family disputes, has occurred in Lebanon. Suspects in kidnappings \nmay have ties to terrorist or criminal organizations. \nThere is potential for death or injury in Lebanon because of terrorist attacks. Violent \nextremist groups, including U.S. government-designated terrorist organizations, operate \nin Lebanon. ISIS and Al-Nusrah Front have claimed responsibility for suicide bombings \nin Lebanon. U.S. citizens have been the targets of terrorist attacks in Lebanon. The threat \nof anti-Western terrorist activity persists, as does the risk of death or injury to non-targeted \nbystanders. Clashes between Lebanese authorities and criminal elements continue to \noccur in areas of the Bekaa Valley and border regions. Hizballah maintains a strong \npresence in the Bekaa Valley, in addition to areas in southern Lebanon and south Beirut. \nHizballah has been the target of attacks by other extremist groups for their support of the \nAssad regime in Syria. \nTerrorist groups operating in Lebanon include U.S. government-designated foreign \nterrorist organizations such as Hizballah and ISIS. Hizballah continued armed militia \nactivities in Iraq, Syria, and Yemen in collaboration with the Iranian regime. Lebanon\u2019s \nPalestinian refugee camps remained largely outside the control of Lebanese security \nforces and posed a security threat because of the potential for militant recruitment and \nterrorist infiltration. Several individuals on the FBI\u2019s most wanted list and the Department \nof State's Rewards for Justice list reportedly remained in Lebanon. \nIran continues to provide Hizballah with most of its funding, training, weapons, and \nexplosives, as well as political, diplomatic, monetary, and organizational aid. Iran\u2019s annual \nfinancial backing to Hizballah - which has been estimated to be hundreds of millions of \ndollars annually-accounts for the overwhelming majority of the group\u2019s annual budget. \nThis support has made Hizballah a dangerous terrorist partner with Iran and the most-\ncapable terrorist organization in Lebanon.

While ISIS and al-Qa\u2019ida suffered \nmajor leadership losses in 2022, degrading external operations and capabilities, both \norganizations\u2019 offshoots continue to exploit local conflicts and broader political instability \nto make territorial and operational gains. Lebanese Hizballah will continue to develop its \nglobal terrorist capabilities as a complement to the group\u2019s growing conventional military \ncapabilities in the region. \nHizballah seeks to reduce U.S. influence in Lebanon and the broader Middle East. \nHizballah maintains the capability to target U.S. persons and interests in the region, \nworldwide, and, to a lesser extent, in the United States. Iran could benefit strategically if \nHizballah were to conduct terrorist activity on U.S. soil. The U.S. Department of the \nTreasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) has imposed sanctions against \nmultiple people and entities connected to Hizballah. The U.S. Department of Justice has \nprosecuted individuals connected to Hizballah for espionage, terrorism, and export \nviolations. Significant human rights violations continue to occur in Lebanon. \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v.

Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision.

It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro.

They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \n7 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 7 lists conditions that could raise a foreign influence security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;   \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology; \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship \nstatus, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n(f) substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign country, \nor in any foreign owned or foreign-operated business that could subject the \nindividual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation or \npersonal conflict of interest. \nThe mere possession of close family ties with people living in a foreign country is \nnot, as a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if an applicant, his or \nher spouse, or someone sharing living quarters with them, has such a relationship with \neven one person living in a foreign country, this factor alone is sufficient to create the \npotential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the compromise of classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 08-02864 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Dec. 29, 2009) (discussing \nproblematic visits of that applicant\u2019s father to Iran). \nIn ISCR Case No. 17-01979 at 5 (App. Bd. July 31, 2019) the Appeal Board \nreversed the grant of a security clearance and noted, \u201cApplication of the guidelines is not \na comment on an applicant\u2019s patriotism but merely an acknowledgment that people may \nact in unpredictable ways when faced with choices that could be important to a loved-\none, such as a family member.\u201d \nNot every foreign contact or tie presents the heightened risk under AG \u00b6 7(a). The \n\u201cheightened risk\u201d denotes a risk greater than the normal risk inherent in having a family \nmember living under a foreign government. The nature and strength of the ties and the \ncountry involved (i.e., the nature of its government, its relationship with the United States, \nand its human rights record) are relevant in assessing whether there is a likelihood of \nvulnerability to coercion. \u201c[T]he nature of the foreign government involved, and the \nintelligence-gathering history of that government are among the important considerations \nthat provide context for the other record evidence and must be brought to bear on the \nJudge\u2019s ultimate conclusions in the case.

May 15, 2018) (citing \nISCR Case No. 15-00528 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 13, 2017)). Another important consideration \nis the nature of a nation\u2019s government\u2019s relationship with the United States. These factors \nare relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members or friends living \nin that country are vulnerable to government coercion or inducement. \nThe risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign \ncountry has an authoritarian government, the government ignores the rule of law including \nwidely accepted civil liberties, a family member is associated with or dependent upon the \ngovernment, the government is engaged in a counterinsurgency, terrorism causes a \nsubstantial amount of death or property damage, or the country is known to conduct \nintelligence collection operations against the United States. The relationship of Lebanon \nwith the United States and the situations involving terrorists and insurgents in that country \nplaces a significant burden of persuasion on Applicant to demonstrate that his \nrelationships with anyone living in that country does not pose a security risk because of \nthe risks due to terrorist activities in that country. Applicant should not be placed into a \nposition where he might be forced to choose between the protection of classified \ninformation and concerns about assisting someone living in Lebanon. \nThe issue under Guideline B is whether Applicant has ties or contacts with friends \nor associates in Lebanon, which raise security concerns because those ties and contacts \ncreate a potential vulnerability that criminals or terrorists could seek to exploit in an effort \nto get unauthorized access to U.S. classified information that he has by virtue of a security \nclearance. Applicant may be vulnerable to influence or pressure exerted on, or through, \nhis family. \nInternational terrorist groups are known to conduct intelligence activities as \neffectively as capable state intelligence services, and Lebanon has a significant problem \nwith terrorism and crime. Applicant\u2019s family living in Lebanon \u201ccould be a means through \nwhich Applicant comes to the attention of those who seek U.S. information or technology \nand who would attempt to exert coercion upon him.\u201d ADP Case No. 14-01655 at 3 (App. \nBd. Dec. 9, 2015) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-02950 at 3 (App. Bd. May 14, 2015)). \nApplicant\u2019s relationships with family living in Lebanon create a potential conflict of \ninterest because terrorists could place pressure on them to attempt to cause Applicant to \ncompromise classified information. Additionally, he has financial and property interests in \nLebanon, although those interests are not as substantial when compared to his financial \nand property interests in the United States. Those relationships and interests create \u201ca \nheightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion\u201d under AG \u00b6 \n7. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(b), 7(e), and 7(f) apply, and further inquiry is necessary about potential \napplication of any mitigating conditions.  \nAG \u00b6 8 lists conditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns \nincluding: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \n9 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States; \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent \nthat there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or \nexploitation; \n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or \nare approved by the agency head or designee; \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements \nregarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, \ngroups, or organizations from a foreign country; and \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not be \nused effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \nAs indicated in the disqualifying conditions of the Foreign Influence section, supra, \nApplicant has relationships with family living in Lebanon. He also owns property in \nLebanon. These issues increase the risk that family and financial interests in Lebanon \ncould be targeted to put pressure on Applicant to provide classified information. \nThe Appeal Board has concluded that contact every two months or three months \nconstitutes \u201cfrequent contact\u201d under AG \u00b6\u00b6 7 and 8. ISCR Case No. 14-05986 at 3-4 (App. \nBd. Oct. 14, 2016). See also ISCR Case No. 04-09541 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Sept. 26, 2006) \n(finding contacts with applicant\u2019s siblings once every four or five months not casual and \ninfrequent and stating \u201cThe frequency with which Applicant speaks to his family members \nin Iran does not diminish the strength of his family ties.\u201d). Frequency of contact is not the \nsole determinant of foreign interest security concerns. \nApplicant\u2019s SOR does not allege that he visited Lebanon frequently, and that his \nspouse has frequent contacts with her parents who are citizens and residents of Lebanon. \nIn ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006), the Appeal Board listed five \ncircumstances in which conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered, stating: \n(a) to assess an applicant\u2019s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant\u2019s \nevidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to \nconsider whether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation;  \n10 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) to decide whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines is \napplicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person analysis under \nDirective Section 6.3. \nId. (citing ISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-\n0633 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 24, 2003)). See also ISCR Case No. 12-09719 at 3 (App. Bd. \nApr. 6, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-00151 at 3, n. 1 (App. Bd. Sept. 12, 2014); ISCR \nCase No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006)). The non-SOR information discussed \nabove will not be considered except for the five purposes listed above. \nA key factor in the AG \u00b6 8(b) analysis is Applicant\u2019s \u201cdeep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S.\u201d His relationship with the United States must be \nweighed against the potential conflict of interest created by his connections to Lebanon. \nApplicant was born in Lebanon, and first came to the United States on an F-1 Visa in \n1983. He \u201cofficially\u201d entered the United States when he received his \u201cgreen card,\u201d became \na naturalized U.S. citizen in September 2000, and was issued his most recent U.S. \npassport in November 2020. After completing high school in Lebanon in 1982, he \ncontinued his higher education in the United States. His spouse became a U.S. citizen \nthree years after marrying him in 2008. His daughter is a U.S. citizen. He has worked for \nhis current Defense-contractor employer since November 2021. \nThese factors are balanced against the security concerns outlined in the SOR. \nApplicant\u2019s access to classified information would add risk to his family in Lebanon. There \nis no allegation that he would choose to help the terrorists against the interests of the \nUnited States. A Guideline B adjudication is not a judgment on an applicant\u2019s character \nor loyalty to the United States. It is a determination as to whether an applicant\u2019s \ncircumstances foreseeably present a security risk. See ISCR Case No. 19-00831 at 5 \n(App. Bd. July 29, 2020). The concern here pertains to the risk to his family living in \nLebanon and how that risk could be used to coerce Applicant. It does not relate to his \nloyalty or patriotism to the United States. \nApplicant has not rebutted the concern arising from his relationships with family or \nowning his properties in Lebanon. His travels to Lebanon, sending money to his in-laws \nin Lebanon, and sending money to his brother to maintain his property in Lebanon are \nalso factors indicating his care and concern for citizens and residents of Lebanon and his \naffection for them as well as his desire to maintain his property in Lebanon. His \nconnections to the United States, taken together, are insufficient to overcome the foreign \ninfluence security concerns under Guideline B. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n11 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n     \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline B are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant has important connections to the United States as discussed under \nGuideline B. His U.S. citizenship, his spouse\u2019s U.S. citizenship, and his child\u2019s U.S. \ncitizenship, and his contributions to DOD-related work by his employer are some of his \nmost important connections to the United States. He made a credible and sincere \nstatement about his strong commitment to the United States. \nThe reasons for denying Applicant\u2019s security clearance are more compelling. A \nGuideline B decision concerning Lebanon must take into consideration the geopolitical \nsituation and dangers in that country. See ISCR Case No. 04-02630 at 3 (App. Bd. May \n23, 2007) (remanding because of insufficient discussion of geopolitical situation and \nsuggesting expansion of whole-person discussion); ISCR Case No. 02-26130 at 3 (App. \nBd. Dec. 7, 2006) (reversing grant of security clearance because of terrorist activity in the \nWest Bank). Lebanon is a dangerous place because of violence from terrorists and \ncriminals and the risk of war with Israel. Terrorists continue to threaten the interests of the \nUnited States, and those who cooperate and assist the United States. \nApplicant has a history of visiting Lebanon. He has fairly frequent contacts with his \nbrother and sister who are resident citizens of Lebanon. His spouse has frequent contacts \nwith her parents there. Concern for and loyalty to family living in Lebanon is a positive \ncharacter trait. However, Applicant did not show that he was unlikely to come to the \nattention of those interested in acquiring U.S. classified information, and willing to coerce \nor extort him to obtain it. \u201cApplication of the guidelines is not a comment on an applicant\u2019s \npatriotism but merely an acknowledgment that people may act in unpredictable ways \nwhen faced with choices that could be important\u201d to a family member. See Generally \nISCR Case No. 17-01979 at 5 (App. Bd. July 31, 2019). It is not in the national interest to \nput Applicant in such a situation. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, \nExec. Or. 10865, the Directive, the AGs, and the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence to the \n12 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________________ \nfacts and circumstances in the context of the whole person.

He essentially denied the personal conduct \nallegation (SOR \u00b6 2.a.), also with substantial comments. Applicant\u2019s admissions and \nacknowledgments are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and \nthorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I \nmake the following additional findings of fact: \nBackground \nApplicant is a 48-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving \nas an application engineer with a university applied physics lab since July 2022. He \npreviously worked for other employers as a data integration consultant (March 2022 \u2013 \nJuly 2022); chief technology officer (January 2018 \u2013 March 2022); and senior engineering \nIT analyst (April 2009 \u2013 January 2018). He received an associate degree in mechanical \nengineering technology in 1995 and a bachelor\u2019s degree in plastics engineering \ntechnology in 1998. He has never served with the U.S. military. It is unclear if he was ever \ngranted a security clearance. He was married in 2004.

In January 2015 while serving as a youth \nassistant wrestling coach, and engaging in a friendly match with another coach, Applicant \nsuffered a herniated vertebra, causing excruciating pain for a period of 12 to 16 months. \nHe eventually underwent minimally invasive surgery and became heavily dependent on \nopiates which masked the pain but also introduced undesirable side effects. \nAccording to one version of the scenario, shortly ---\nprior to his surgery, Applicant \ntravelled to another state where he purchased some medical marijuana to find an \nalternative to the opiates. He claimed to be under the impression that the purchases were \nlegal because they were done over the counter without the need for a state marijuana \ncard which is required in his home state. He also illegally purchased marijuana through \nother students at school, but either failed or refused to identify the students\u2019 names. On \noccasion, he would purchase over the counter cannabidiol (CBD) products, some of \nwhich contained concentrations of THC. While his surgery greatly reduced the pain, it \nalso left him with a constant numbness on the left side of his body. In April 2020, several \nyears after his surgery, the pain started to increase, and he entered the state medical \nmarijuana program. He remained in the program and continued using marijuana until \nNovember 2022, when he decided to search for a new career. (Item 2, at 2; Item 3 at 34-\n35; Item 4 at 5) \nAlthough Applicant claims to have \u201ca bit of disdain for drugs and alcohol\u201d \u2013 based \non a family and friend history of substance abuse and substance-related suicides, he \nrecognizes that it is unfortunate that the one drug he wishes to use for his medical issues \nis illegal under federal law. (Item 2 at 3) Applicant began using the marijuana \u2013 in the form \nof edibles obtained from local dispensaries - to help him manage his back pain and enable \nhim to relax and fall asleep. He generally used it while alone at night. (Item 4 at 5) When \nhe was interviewed by an investigator with the U.S. Office of Personnel Management \n(OPM) on November 28, 2022, Applicant stated that he intended \u201cto keep using the drug \nas it is helpful to relieve his back pain and help with his insomnia.\u201d (Item 4 at 5) In his SF \n86 and in his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted that he desired to use medical \nmarijuana in the future for all the reasons he previously explained. Nevertheless, while \nhe would prefer to use it for its intended purposes, his career and livelihood are more \nimportant to him than the pain and numbness, and he intended to seek other treatments \nsuch as CBD. (Item 2 at 2; Item 3 at 34) \nAs of the closing of the record, Applicant had not submitted a signed statement of \nintent to abstain from all drug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility; \nand had not submitted verifiable proof that he had disassociated himself from drug-\nproviding associates. In addition, he failed to submit verifiable evidence that he is no \nlonger participating in the state medical marijuana program, an association that he \nclaimed he terminated in November 2022. \nThere is no evidence to indicate that Applicant ever reported his marijuana use to \nhis employer\u2019s security manager or to anyone else where he worked. \n3 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nRegarding Applicant\u2019s alleged deliberate falsification of facts associated with the \ncommencement date of his first use of marijuana, in his SF 86, he reported his first such \ninvolvement occurred through the state medical marijuana program in April 2020 \n\u201cestimated.\u201d (Item 3 at 34-35) The Government has argued that his use of marijuana \ncommenced in January 2015, not five years later as he reported. Applicant denied \ndeliberately failing to disclose that his use of marijuana began in January 2015, claiming \nthat the year was one of the most difficult years of his life and much of it was a blur. He \nexplained that he had a lapse of memory when completing his SF 86 since he did not \nregularly use marijuana between 2015 and 2020. He remembered the more accurate date \nshortly before his OPM interview during which he revealed the 2015 date. (Item 2 at 3) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The President has \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.) \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of several variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable, and unfavorable, in making a \nmeaningful decision. \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  \n(ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1)).  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994).) \n4 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation, or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).) \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship transcends \nnormal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is because of this \nspecial relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high degree of trust \nand confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified information. \nDecisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant may \ndeliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail \na certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, \nrisk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 \n7) Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this \ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not \nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing a clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement and Substance \nAbuse is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n5 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFurthermore, on October 25, 2014, the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) \nissued Memorandum ES 2014-00674, Adherence to Federal Laws Prohibiting Marijuana \nUse, which states: \n[C]hanges to state laws and the laws of the District of Columbia pertaining \nto marijuana use do not alter the existing National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines (Reference H and I). An individual's disregard of federal law \npertaining to the use, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains \nadjudicatively relevant in national security determinations. As always, \nadjudicative authorities are expected to evaluate claimed or developed use \nof, or involvement with, marijuana using the current adjudicative criteria. \nThe adjudicative authority must determine if the use of, or involvement with, \nmarijuana raises questions about the individual's judgment, reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and willingness to comply with law, rules, and regulations, \nincluding federal laws, when making eligibility decisions of persons \nproposed for, or occupying, sensitive national security positions. \nIn addition, on December 21, 2021, the DNI issued Memorandum ES 2021-01529, \nSecurity Executive Agent Clarifying Guidance Concerning Marijuana for Agencies \nConducting Adjudications of Persons Proposed for Eligibility for Access to Classified \nInformation or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position, which states in part: \n. . . disregard of federal law pertaining to marijuana remains relevant, but \nnot determinative, to adjudications of eligibility for access to classified \ninformation or eligibility to hold a sensitive position\u2026. \nAdditionally, in light of the long-standing federal law and policy prohibiting \nillegal drug use while occupying a sensitive position or holding a security \nclearance, agencies are encouraged to advise prospective national security \nworkforce employees that they should refrain from any future marijuana use \nupon initiation of the national security vetting process, which commences \nonce the individual signs the certification contained in the Standard Form \n86 (SF 86), Questionnaire for National Security Positions. \nWith respect to the use of CBD products, agencies should be aware that \nusing these cannabis derivatives may be relevant to adjudications in \naccordance with SEAD 4. Although the passage of the Agricultural \nImprovement Act of 2018 excluded hemp from the definition of marijuana \nwithin the Controlled Substances Act, products containing greater than a \n0.3 percent concentration of \u2026 THC, a psychoactive ingredient in \nmarijuana, do not meet the definition of \u201chemp.\u201d Accordingly, products \nlabeled as hemp-derived that contain greater than 0.3 percent THC \ncontinue to meet the legal definition of marijuana, and therefore remain \nillegal to use under federal law and policy. Additionally, agencies should be \naware that the Federal Drug Administration does not certify levels of THC \nin CBD products, so the percentage of THC cannot be guaranteed, thus \nposing a concern pertaining to the use of a CBD product under federal law. \n6 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nStudies have shown that some CBD products exceed the 0.3 percent \nthreshold for hemp, notwithstanding advertising labels\u2026. Therefore, there \nis a risk that using these products may nonetheless cause sufficiently high \nlevels of THC to result in a positive marijuana test under agency-\nadministered employment or random drug testing programs. \nThe guideline notes several conditions under AG \u00b6 25 that could raise security \nconcerns in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition);  \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including . . . purchase;  \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position; and \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \nCommencing in about January 2015, or perhaps sometime after that date, \nApplicant legally and illegally purchased, as well as used, marijuana \u2013 a Schedule I \nControlled Substance \u2013 to help him manage his back pain and enable him to relax and \nfall asleep, until at least November 2022. During the same period, he obtained and used \nCBD, the concentration of THC which has not been established. Nevertheless, both \nproducts were used for the same purposes. He purportedly stopped purchasing and using \nthe marijuana and the CBD in November 2022, several months after he submitted his SF \n86 July 2022 in preparation for being hired by his current employer. That continued use \nof marijuana after July 2022 raises questions about his judgment, reliability, and \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. See ISCR Case No. 16-03460 at \n3 (App. Bd. May 24, 2018) \nApplicant\u2019s variety of comments regarding future use of marijuana create some \nconfusion regarding his true intentions. He initially intended \u201cto keep using the drug as it \nis helpful to relieve \u2026 back pain and help with his insomnia.\u201d He eventually stated that \nwhile he would prefer to use it for its intended purposes, his career and livelihood are \npurportedly more important to him than the pain and numbness, and he intended to seek \nother treatments such as CBD. But he continued to use marijuana for several months \nafter submitting his SF 86. These comment variations and continued use reflect an \nequivocation or failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 25(a), 25(c), and 25(g) have been established. While it appears that the positions \nApplicant has held in the past might be sensitive positions, there is no evidence other \nthan speculative evidence that they were sensitive positions, and thus AG \u00b6 25(f) has not \nbeen established \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions under AG \u00b6 26 that could \nmitigate security concerns arising from Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse: \n7 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) providing a \nsigned statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \nAs noted above, as of the closing of the record, Applicant had merely submitted a \nwatered-down indication or equivocation that he would live with his pain while hoping to \ncontinue using marijuana but seeking CBD substitutes. He had not submitted a signed \nstatement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and substance misuse, \nacknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national \nsecurity eligibility; and had not submitted verifiable proof that he had disassociated \nhimself from drug-providing associates. In addition, he failed to submit verifiable evidence \nthat he is no longer participating in the state medical marijuana program, an association \nthat he claimed he terminated in November 2022 \u2013 several months after he obtained his \ncurrent position. AG \u00b6 26(b) minimally applies, but the other mitigating condition does not \napply. \nA person should not be held forever accountable for misconduct from the past. \nContinued abstinence is to be encouraged, but, when balanced against his full history of \nmarijuana use, the relatively brief period of purported abstinence is considered insufficient \nto conclude that the abstinence will continue, especially after so much confusion \nregarding his future intentions. Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana for such a lengthy period, \ncontinues to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \n8 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or cooperate \nwith security processing, including but not limited to meeting with a security \ninvestigator for subject interview, completing security forms or releases, \ncooperation with medical or psychological evaluation, or polygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful questions of \ninvestigators, security officials, or other official representatives in \nconnection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination. \nThe guideline also includes a condition that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 16: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.  \nMy discussions related to Applicant\u2019s drug involvement and substance misuse are \nadopted herein. As noted above, the exact commencement period of Applicant\u2019s use of \nmarijuana and CBD, as well as his purchase history, are unclear for Applicant has given \nseveral different versions. He was quite clear in his July 2022 SF 86 when he reported \nwhat he considered to be an \u201cestimated\u201d commencement date of April 2020. When he \nwas questioned by the OPM investigator several months later in November 2022, he \ncandidly acknowledged that he had listed the date incorrectly. In his Answer to the SOR \nhe denied deliberately failing to disclose the actual date claiming he had a lapse of \nmemory when filling out the form. As he noted, when the actual dates were recalled, he \ninformed the investigator rather than concealing the truth. \nDepartment Counsel argues that Applicant\u2019s new explanation regarding the \ncommencement date is undercut by his earlier inconsistent explanations. Those earlier \nreported \u201cfacts\u201d clearly were confusing. However, except for the dates, Applicant did \nreport his use of marijuana and he did not conceal it throughout the entire process. \nNormally an applicant\u2019s comments provide sufficient evidence to examine if his or \nher answers were deliberate falsifications as alleged in the SOR or merely inaccurate \nanswers that were the result of oversight or misunderstanding of the true facts on his or \nher part. Proof of incorrect answers, standing alone, does not establish or prove an \napplicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the falsification or omission occurred. As an \nadministrative judge, I must consider the record evidence to determine whether there is \ndirect or circumstantial evidence concerning Applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time \nthe alleged falsifications or omissions occurred. The muddled facts described throughout \nthe entire investigation as well as his estimated start date lead me to conclude that there \nis no direct or circumstantial evidence that Applicant deliberately falsified the \ncommencement date of his marijuana use. Accordingly, AG \u00b6 16(a) has not been \nestablished. \n9 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case considering the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. (See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d \n389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006)) \nThere is some evidence mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct. Applicant is a 48-year-old \nemployee of a defense contractor. He has been serving as an application engineer with \na university applied physics lab since July 2022. He previously worked for other \nemployers as a data integration consultant; chief technology officer; and senior \nengineering IT analyst. He received an associate degree in mechanical engineering \ntechnology in 1995 and a bachelor\u2019s degree in plastics engineering technology in 1998. \nApplicant was partially candid in his SF 86 and spoke freely with the OPM investigator \nregarding his marijuana use. He was also candid about his desire to continue using \nmarijuana in the future to address his pain. \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. \nApplicant legally and illegally purchased, as well as used, marijuana \u2013 a Schedule I \nControlled Substance \u2013 either in January 2015 or sometime thereafter to help him \nmanage his back pain and enable him to relax and fall asleep. During the same period, \nhe obtained and used CBD, the concentration of THC which had not been established. \nNevertheless, both products were used for the same purposes. Although he submitted \nhis SF 86 in July 2022, he continued using marijuana until at least November 2022. There \nis still a degree of equivocation surrounding his future intent regarding using marijuana. \nOverall, the evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his drug \ninvolvement and substance abuse. See SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) (1) through AG 2(d) (9). \n10 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                    \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n__________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. and 1.b.: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a.:  \n \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

On March \n23, 2023, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency Consolidated \nAdjudication Services (DCSA CAS) sent her a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging \nsecurity concerns under Guideline F.

DOHA received \nthe transcript (Tr.) on January 4, 2024. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 63-year-old administrative specialist employed by a defense \ncontractor since October 2021. She has been employed by various federal contractors \nsince November 2009. She has three adult children. She was cleared for a public trust \nposition in May 2016. \nApplicant immigrated to the United States in April 1979, when she was 18 years \nold, unmarried, and had two daughters. She became a U.S. citizen in May 1993, attended \na trade school, earned an associate degree from a community college in 1991, and was \nemployed in the private sector until she began working for federal contractors. An Air \nForce major general for whom Applicant worked from January 2021 through June 2023 \nsubmitted a letter attesting to Applicant\u2019s competence and trustworthiness in her handling \nof the records of sensitive investigations. (AX F) \nApplicant\u2019s two daughters both became U.S. citizens and graduated from college. \nThe older daughter is a senior project manager for a major U.S. corporation, and the \nyounger daughter is a senior employee of a DOD agency and has held a security \nclearance since 2001. The younger daughter submitted a letter attesting to her mother\u2019s \nintelligence, trustworthiness, and motivation. (AX G) \nThe SOR alleges a single delinquent debt to a credit union that was charged off \nfor $34,606. The debt was a consolidation loan and is reflected in credit reports from June \n2022 and December 2023. Applicant obtained the loan in July 2018, and her last payment \non the loan was in December 2018. (GX 2 and 3) In her answer to the SOR, Applicant \ndenied the allegation, because she believed that she owed a lesser amount. (Tr. 32) \nApplicant testified that she leased an automobile in 2018. Shortly thereafter, she \nrealized that she was paying more on her debts than she was earning. When she was \ninterviewed by a security investigator, she attributed her delinquent debts to overspending \nfor furniture and preparing to move to a new residence. She hired a debt-resolution \ncompany in 2017 or 2018 that resolved some of her delinquent debts. Her credit report \nfrom June 2022 reflected four delinquent debts (three credit card debts and one debt to \nthe credit union alleged in the SOR) that were settled for less than the full balance. (GX \n2 at 3-4) She testified that she fired the debt-resolution company because it was not \npaying all her creditors. The company explained to her that it could not pay all her \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncreditors because she had insufficient funds in her account with them to resolve all her \ndebts. (Tr. 55) \nApplicant testified that she contacted the creditor alleged in the SOR several times, \nbeginning in 2019, but received no response. After she was interviewed by a security \ninvestigator several times in June, July, August, and September 2022, she sent the \ncreditor a letter in May 2023. She did not have a copy of the letter. (Tr. 44) \nOn November 20, 2023, Applicant wrote another letter to the credit union \nproposing a payment plan with the following conditions: (1) reduce the amount of the debt \nto $20,000; (2) deduct payments automatically from her checking account for 60 months, \nwithout any interest added, beginning in January 2024; (3) assess no penalty for an early \npayoff; and (4) notify credit bureaus that the debt is being resolved. (AX B) As of the date \nof the hearing, she had not received a response from the credit union. \nIn Applicant\u2019s post-hearing submission, she explained she contacted the credit \nunion again and learned that the credit union could not respond to her letters and \ntelephone calls because the credit-repair company was listed as her representative, and \na \u201ccease and desist notification\u201d precluded the credit union from contacting her. She \nnotified the credit union that the debt-resolution company was no longer her \nrepresentative. (AX I and J) She stated that she had negotiated an agreement with the \ncredit union to pay $380 per month by automatic deduction from her checking account, \nbeginning on January 17, 2024. She did not submit documentary evidence of the \nagreement, but she submitted evidence that she made a $200 payment to the credit union \non December 21, 2023. (AX H; AX K) \nApplicant\u2019s long-time friend and companion testified on her behalf. He testified that \nhe and Applicant travel together and exchange gifts. The last trip he could remember was \nin 2018 (Tr. 69). He also testified that he was a cosigner on a debt-consolidation loan \nfrom the creditor alleged in the SOR, and that monthly payments of about $550 were \ndeducted from his bank account from 2019 until this year. (Tr. 72) It was unclear which \nbank accounts he cosigned, because the December 2023 credit report reflects three debt-\nconsolidation loans from the same creditor, as well as two joint credit-card accounts. (GX \n3 at 7, 11, 13, 14) \nApplicant currently earns $49,000 per year. (Tr. 27) At the hearing, she estimated \nthat she had about $1,000 in her checking account and about $15,000 in her retirement \naccount. (Tr. 47-48) She bought her personal vehicle in 2018 car and owes about $9,000 \non the car loan.

Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe evidence submitted at the hearing establishes two disqualifying conditions \nunder this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d) and AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of \nnot meeting financial obligations\u201d). \nThe following mitigating conditions are relevant: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \nAG \u00b6 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant has only one delinquent debt, but it was \nincurred in an effort to resolve an accumulation of multiple delinquent debts. The debt is \nrecent and was not incurred under circumstances making recurrence unlikely. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not established. Applicant presented no evidence of circumstances \nlargely beyond her control. Her delinquent debts were the result of spending more than \nshe earned. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is not established. Applicant presented no evidence of financial \ncounseling. There is no evidence that the debt-resolution company provided the type of \nfinancial counseling contemplated by this mitigating condition. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is not fully established. Although Applicant stated in her post-hearing \nsubmission that she had reached an agreement with the credit union, she provided no \ndocumentary evidence of an agreement. An applicant who claims that a debt is being \nresolved is expected to provide documentary evidence to support that claim. See ISCR \nCase No. 15-03363 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 19, 2016). At this point, Applicant has promised \nto resolve the debt but her promise is not a substitute for a track record of paying debts \nin a timely manner. ISCR Case No. 17-04110 (App. Bd. Sep. 26, 2019). \nAG \u00b6 20(e) is not established. Although Applicant denied the debt in her response \nto the SOR, she explained that her denial applied only to the amount of the debt and not \nto its validity. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Applicant was candid and sincere at the \nhearing. She has commendably overcome significant obstacles since her immigration to \nthe United States. However, she did not take responsible actions to resolve the debt \nalleged in the SOR until she realized that it was an impediment to obtaining a security \nclearance. Evidence of past irresponsibility is not mitigated by payment of debts only \nunder pressure of qualifying for a security clearance. ISCR Case No. 16-01211 (App. Bd. \nMay 30, 2018). She may well qualify for a security clearance in the future, but she has \nnot yet reached that point. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under \nGuideline F and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by her financial situation. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information. Clearance \nis denied. \nLeRoy F. Foreman \nAdministrative Judge \n7 \n",

(HE I, Att. 1 at 1) Russia tries to position itself as a \ngreat power competitor to the United States by undermining norms within the existing \ninternational system, including core Western institutions such as the North Atlantic \nTreaty Organization and the European Union, as well as free markets, and \ndemocracies. (HE I, Att. 2 at 2) Russia uses espionage and cyber-threats to influence \nother countries\u2019 decisions and compromise critical infrastructure. (HE I, Att. 10 at 12) \nRussia\u2019s commercial espionage is so pervasive that the U.S. Commerce Department\u2019s \nBureau of Industry and Security severely restricted license applications for exports and \nreexports. (HE I, Att. 6) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and common-sense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

Instead, it is a \ndetermination as to whether an applicant\u2019s circumstances foreseeably present a \nsecurity risk. See ISCR Case No. 19-00831 at 5 (App. Bd. July 29, 2020). \nRussia is an adversary that has historically sought to undermine Western, liberal \nvalues and is seeking to expand its influence worldwide through any means necessary, \nincluding espionage, cyberattacks, and interference in foreign elections. Under these \ncircumstances, Applicant\u2019s relationship with his wife and parents-in-law triggers the \napplication of AG \u00b6 7(a), \u201ccontact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, \nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident \nin a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.\u201d \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 are potentially applicable, as \nfollows: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; \n(b) there is no conflict of interest either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and  \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation.  \nRussia\u2019s ruthlessness in expanding its malign sphere of influence in the global \ninternational order generates a very heavy burden for applicants with Russian family or \nfinancial interests to overcome in order to mitigate the security concern. See ISCR Case \nNo. 17-04208 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 7, 2019) Applicant is an exceptional individual, well \nrespected by his supervisor, his friends, and coworkers. His wife has lived in the United \nStates for her entire adult life, and Applicant\u2019s contact with his parents-in-law is \n4 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n__________________________ \ninfrequent. Conversely, his father-in-law is a retired colonel in the Russian Navy and, in \naddition to their family ties, Applicant has a significant financial obligation to him, as he \nis currently repaying a $100,000 personal loan. Given the depth of these contacts and \nthe country involved, none of the mitigating conditions apply. Applicant failed to mitigate \nthe security concern. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nIn reaching this decision, I considered the relevant disqualifying and mitigating \nconditions, together with the character evidence concerning Applicant\u2019s superior work \nperformance and the respect with which he is held in the community. Unfortunately, this \nwas insufficient to overcome the burden generated by his family contacts with Russia. \nFormal Finding \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.c:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the security interests of the United States to grant Applicant \neligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nMarc E. Curry \nAdministrative Judge \n5 \n",

Her admissions are \nincorporated as findings of fact. After a review of the pleadings and evidence, I make \nthe following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is 25 years old. She works for a government contractor as a systems \nengineer. Her permanent employment began in August 2022, but previously she \ninterned for the same employer while still attending college during the summer of 2021. \nThere is no evidence that she was employed by this employer between August 2021 \nand August 2022. She began college in 2017, and completed her bachelor\u2019s degree in \nMay 2022. She completed her security clearance application (SCA) in October 2022, \nafter she became a permanent employee. She is single and has no children. (Tr. at 6, \n18, 47-48; GE 1-2) \nThe SOR alleged Applicant used marijuana from May 2017 to June 2022. It \nfurther alleged she used ecstasy in December 2017; she used Adderall, not prescribed \nto her, in November 2020; she used cocaine in February 2021; and she used \nmushrooms from May 2022 to July 2022. The SOR also alleged that she intended to \nuse marijuana in the future. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1a-1.f) \nApplicant fully disclosed her drug history on her 2022 SCA and she further \nexplained that history during her December 2022 background interview. During her \ntestimony, she explained that her drug use was experimental during her college years. \nShe described herself as na\u00efve in high school, not having many friends, and did not \nengage in many activities. All that changed in college and she socialized more with \npeople and wanted to show her friends she was not afraid to try things. This included \nexperimenting with some drugs, which she now admits was foolish behavior. (Tr. 29-31; \nGE 1-2) She consistently described the extent of her drug behavior as follows: \nUse of Marijuana: Applicant used marijuana by smoking it or ingesting edibles starting \nin about May 2017. She used marijuana no more than 30 times and her last use was in \nJuly 2022. She only purchased marijuana from state-run dispensaries. She indicated on \nher SCA that she would use marijuana in the future. During her background interview, \nshe reversed that position and stated that she did not intend to use any illegal drugs in \nthe future. During her testimony, on several occasions, she categorically stated she had \nno intentions to use marijuana in the future. I found her testimony sincere and credible. \n(Tr. 31, 33, 36, 40, 54, 57; GE 1-2) \nUse of Ecstasy (MDMA): Applicant ingested one tablet of MDMA at a house party. She \ndid not feel any effects from its use.

That was her only use of MDMA and she does \nnot intend to use it in the future. I found her testimony credible. (Tr. 37; GE 1-2) \nUse of Adderall: Applicant admitted ingesting 20 milligrams of Adderall, a prescription \ndrug, in approximately December 2020. She did not have a legal prescription for the \ndrug when she used it. She used it while in college to help concentrate on her studies. A \nfriend suggested that she use it and supplied it. She has only used it that one time and \nhas no intention to use it illegally in the future. I found her testimony credible. (Tr. 38-40; \nGE 1-2) \nUse of Cocaine: Applicant used cocaine one time at a house party in approximately \nDecember 2021. She did not feel any effects from its use. The cocaine was supplied by \na friend. That was her only use of cocaine and she does not intend to use it in the \nfuture. I found her testimony credible. (Tr. 39; GE 1-2) \nUse of Mushrooms (Psychedelic): Applicant used mushrooms on two occasions while \ncamping with friends in May 2022 and July 2022. She got sick after both uses. Those \nwere her only uses of mushrooms and she does not intend to use them in the future. I \nfound her testimony credible. (Tr. 39; GE 1-2) \nFuture Use of Marijuana: Applicant credibly testified that she has no intent to use \nmarijuana in the future. Her father testified that she has matured significantly since \nleaving college. He also believes her SCA answer about using marijuana in the future \nwas impacted by her knowledge that two of her grandparents were legally prescribed \nmarijuana to manage pain as an opioid alternative. He thought that she might not have \nthought about the federal law implications. He also opined that based upon his personal \nfamiliarity with drug users, as a criminal defense attorney, he had no concerns that she \nwas currently using any illegal drugs. Since college, she has moved to a different state \nfrom where her college friends who used drugs are located. Although she has been \nexposed to drugs recently (she was offered cocaine several weeks before the hearing), \nshe has always refused the offers. She also removes herself from the situation and \ndoes not associate with the person offering drugs. She signed a written statement \nwhere she manifested her intent not to use any illegal drugs in the future. (Tr. 18-19, 31, \n33, 54, 57; AE A) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision.

AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement and \nsubstance abuse: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nAG \u00b6 25 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. Those that are potentially applicable in this case include: \n(a) any substance misuse; and  \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \nApplicant used marijuana up to 30 occasions between May 2017 and June 2022. \nShe used cocaine once in 2021, MDMA once in 2017, Adderall, without a prescription, \nonce in 2020, and mushrooms twice in 2022. On her 2022 SCA, she indicated that she \nintended to use marijuana in the future. I find that AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(g) both apply. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \npotentially apply in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;   \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and\nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this\nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not\nlimited to: \n \n \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nApplicant\u2019s use of cocaine, Adderall, MDMA, and mushrooms were infrequent \nand in the nature of experimental use when she was in college. She has not used any of \nthese substances recently. Her marijuana use was more frequent, but ceased when she \nwas permanently hired by her employer in August 2022. There is no evidence that she \nused marijuana while employed as an intern during the summer of 2021. When recently \noffered cocaine, she refused and stated that she would remove herself from the \nenvironment if it happened in the future. She no longer resides in the state where her \ncollege friends live. She provided a signed statement of intent to abstain from all illegal \ndrug use in the future. Both AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b) substantially apply. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI also note in accordance with the Director of National Intelligence\u2019s clarifying \nguidance letter concerning marijuana dated December 21, 2021, I have considered that \nthe evidence here supports mitigation in the form of Applicant\u2019s full disclosure of her \npast drug use on her SCA, her abstinence since 2022, her signed letter of intent of \nnonuse in the future, and her disassociation from those persons who use drugs. The \nguidance also states that violation of federal drug law remains relevant, but not \ndeterminative, to adjudications of security clearance eligibility. (See ES 2021-01529) \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guideline and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline H. Those factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that \nguideline. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the drug involvement and personal conduct security \nconcerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs: 1.a \u2013 1.f: \nFor Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn March 22, 2023, the Department of Defense (DoD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline F (financial \nconsiderations). The action was taken under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) \nimplemented by DoD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant responded to the SOR (Answer) on April 4, 2023, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on November 7, \n2023. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice on November \n16, 2023, scheduling the matter for a hearing on December 12, 2023. \nI convened the hearing as scheduled. At the hearing, I admitted Government \nExhibits (GE) 1 through 9 and Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through I without objection. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant testified and he did not call any witnesses.

DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on December 26, 2023. \nSOR Amendment \nAt the hearing, I granted Department Counsel\u2019s motion to amend the SOR, \npursuant to \u00b6 E3.1.17 of the Directive, to conform to the evidence. The SOR was \namended to add a security concern under Guideline E (personal conduct), numbered as \n\u00b6 2.a, as follows: \n2.a.

Although the record is unclear, it appears he \nwas unemployed a fifth time from April 2023 to November 2023. Since then, he has \nworked as a network engineer for his current employer (E1), a defense contractor.

He took the hard \ndrive to a repair shop to have it wiped clean at his expense, to ensure there was no \nleakage of company proprietary information, and then he discarded the equipment. He \ndid not inform his manager of his actions until a few weeks later, when a general audit \nwas conducted of company assets. His manager told him to contact security, follow \nproper procedures in the future, and he would be issued another laptop. He was fired \ninstead. He was not issued a warning, reprimand, or violation. He acknowledged that he \npanicked, had a lapse in judgment, and made the wrong choice to destroy company \nproperty rather than returning it to his employer. He admitted that he was hesitant to have \nthe value of the laptop deducted from his income. He maintained that there was no \nproprietary, sensitive, or classified information on the equipment.

(GE 2, 7-8) He \nattributes his delinquent debts primarily to his periods of unemployment and being the \nsole provider for his family on a minimal income. He also totaled his car in a January 2019 \ncar accident, which affected his ability to timely report to work, that then led to two \nterminations, as previously discussed.

(SOR \u00b6 1.b) State income \ntax returns for TY 2020 and 2021 reflect that he owed $5,925 and $1,168, respectively. \nHe incurred these tax debts because taxes were not being taken out of his paycheck for \nthe correct state jurisdiction. He was notified of his outstanding state taxes in July 2021. \nDocumentation reflects that he first entered an installment agreement with the state tax \nauthority in April 2023, consisting of monthly payments of $347. He stated that he made \napproximately three payments in accordance with that agreement. Documentation \nreflects that he entered another payment arrangement with the state tax authority in \nDecember 2023, for outstanding state taxes totaling $10,214, in 30 monthly payments of \n$372. (Tr. 35-39, 97-98; GE 3, 9; AE D, G) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c is an auto loan in collection for $10,967. Applicant obtained this loan to \npurchase a new car in 2017. After less than a year, his car was repossessed because he \ncould no longer afford to make his monthly car payments. He owed a deficiency balance \non the loan. He contacted the creditor in August 2023 and made a payment arrangement \nof $639 monthly to pay this debt, but he had not yet made any payments as of the date \nof the hearing. (Tr. 39-43, 105; GE 3-6, 9) \nSOR \u00b6 1.d is a personal loan in collection for $1,062. Applicant obtained this loan \nin 2019 to pay his rent. He made one payment soon after obtaining the loan. He contacted \nthe creditor in early 2023, before he received the SOR, to resolve the debt. \nDocumentation reflects that he paid this debt in January 2024.

Applicant incurred the $640 debt for a dental \nprocedure he had in 2018 or 2019 he believed was covered by health insurance. He \nbelieved the $186 debt related to his child\u2019s medical care. He could not recall what the \n$117 medical debt pertained to. He contacted the creditor in March 2023 to resolve the \ndebts but he could not afford a lump-sum payment.

All vouched for his judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness. (AE J) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of Exec. Or. \n10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall \nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also \nExec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or \nsensitive information). \n6 \n\nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . .. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of not being able to pay his debts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) \nare established. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nConditions beyond Applicant\u2019s control contributed to his debts. The first prong of \nAG \u00b6 20(b) applies. For the full application of AG \u00b6 20(b), he must provide evidence that \nhe acted responsibly under his circumstances. He paid the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.h, 1.k, \nand 1.l, and he is current and paying the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.j. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), and 20(d) \napply to those debts and I find them in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nApplicant has either not made efforts to resolve or did not provide documentation \nto corroborate any of his claims of payment or resolution for the remaining SOR debts. \nHe has not received financial counseling. He needs more time to establish that he has \nhis finances under control. I find that these financial issues continue to cast doubt on his \nreliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) do not \napply to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c, 1.e-1.g, 1.i, and 1.m-1.n. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I considered the following relevant: \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This \nincludes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior. . . . \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other employer\u2019s \ntime or resources. \nApplicant damaged his company laptop and hard drive while working from home \nin 2020. Instead of notifying and returning the equipment to his employer, he took actions \nto wipe the hard drive clean and disposed of the equipment without his employer\u2019s \nknowledge or permission. He did not report his actions until his employer conducted an \naudit of company assets. His actions led to his termination. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(d)(1) and 16(d)(4) \nare established. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17 describes the following relevant conditions that could mitigate the \npersonal conduct security concerns: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur. \nApplicant acknowledged that his actions constituted a serious lapse of judgment. \nHe admitted that he was hesitant to have the value of the laptop deducted from his \nincome. When he finally disclosed his actions to his manager, he was fired. This was an \nisolated incident, he understands the importance of following rules and regulations, and \nhe learned his lesson. AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c) and 17(d) apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F and Guideline \nE in my whole-person analysis. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions \nand doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude \nthat Applicant mitigated the personal conduct security concern but he has not mitigated \nthe financial considerations security concerns. \n9 \n\n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.e-1.g: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.h: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.i \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.j-1.l: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.m-1.n: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on March 29, 2024. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 55-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for \nhis current employer since 2014. There is no evidence of any alcohol-related incidents \naway from work or at work. He served in the U.S. Navy from June 1987 to August 1992 \nand received a General Discharge. He held a security clearance while in the Navy. He \ngraduated high school in 1987 and received a vocational certification for computer \nsystems (IT) in 1996. He has five adult children from his first marriage. He remarried in \n2021 and has a stepchild. (GE 1; Tr. 18-19.) \nApplicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.b, that he began heavily misusing alcohol in \nabout 2020, consuming approximately six to eight drinks per day, including a half gallon \nof whiskey every four days, and that he was diagnosed in 2020 with Alcohol Use Disorder \n\u2013 Severe after voluntarily admitting himself into an inpatient detoxification program \n(detox). (Answer; Tr. at 31.) His discharge paperwork from detox indicated the objective \nwas to maintain abstinence (Tr. at 32.)  \nHe denied SOR \u00b6 1.c, which alleged he began to voluntarily attend a detoxification \nand outpatient program, in which he attended three meetings per week and received \nmonthly medication (vivitrol) to assist with cravings and failed to follow treatment \nrecommendations to attend Alcoholic Anonymous (AA); continue receiving monthly \nvivitrol injections; and abstain from consuming alcohol. He stated his drinking got so bad \nin August 2020 that he voluntarily checked himself into detox. (Tr. at 27.) After being \nreleased from inpatient detox he attended multiple AA meetings but none after the \nrequired outpatient program. He continued to receive monthly vivitrol injections after his \nrequired outpatient program in late 2021. He stopped the injections when his prescriber \nleft the practice. (Tr. 35, 40, 42.) His medical records reflect he returned for a follow-up. \nHe had other medical issues, which now limit his alcohol intake. (Tr. at 39, 48; GE 2 at \n43; GE 4 at 148.) Applicant\u2019s wife testified she had attended some of his treatment \nmeetings and was the person who took him into detox. (Tr. at 72.) He explained he \nstopped attending AA meetings because he could not find a group he could relate to. He \nhad informed the program that he would not stop drinking and was seeking to \u201cmaintain \na healthy relationship with alcohol.\u201d (Tr. at 49, 73.) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d-1.e. Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6 1.d, that in December 2022 he was \nevaluated by a licensed psychologist and diagnosed with Alcohol Use Disorder, \nModerate, in sustained remission, with prognosis of guarded due to his ongoing use of \nalcohol. (GE 3 at 6; Tr. at 42, 46.) He admitted SOR \u00b6 1.e, that alleged in 2021 he \nconsumed upwards of three to four shots of whiskey each time, four to five times per week \nand in about 2022 he was consuming about two to three mixed drinks per week with 1.5 \n2 \n\n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nto 2 shots per drink.

(Answer.) \nHe denied SOR \u00b6 1.f, that he continued to consume alcohol, not in accordance \nwith his treatment advice and recommendations. He explained that he was in compliance \nwith the treatment advice and recommendations of his doctor. (Answer; Tr. at 42.) He \nstarted seeing Doctor [C] in mid-2023. (Tr. at 44; AE B.) Doctor [C] noted as part of the \ntreatment program Applicant submitted to a regular breathalyzer testing program, which \nwere voluntarily submitted. The tests were initially daily and then focused on the \nweekends when he drank. His appointments with Doctor [C], which last about 30 minutes \ncover his breath tests and any online classes he had taken. (AE B; Tr. at 57-62.) Doctor \n[C] prescribed naltrexone. He is currently taking naltrexone. He is being monitored by his \nprimary care physician Doctor [H] because she agrees that naltrexone is an effective \ntreatment for binge drinking. (AE A at 6; Tr at 48, 52, 59-62.) \nApplicant suffered a transient ischemic attack (TIA), also known as a mini stroke, \nin early February 2024. His doctor advised him to discontinue alcohol use because he \nrisked suffering a full stroke if he continued to consume alcohol. (Tr. at 68-69; AE A.) He \nnoted \u201cat this point I have no choice but to stop drinking.\u201d (Tr. at 52.) His wife testified he \nhad not consumed alcohol since the TIA. (Tr. at 68, 75; AE A.) He realizes the seriousness \nof continuing to drink and the consequences if he returns to drinking. I found him to be \ncredible. \nApplicant\u2019s wife took him to detox and was involved in his treatment program. She \nobserved his drinking habits. She described how by 2023 he recognized changes would \npull back if he starts to drink more. (Tr. at 79, 80.) She testified how he researched \nnaltrexone and discussed with his doctor if the medication would help him. (Tr. at 81.) \nShe explained that prior to the TIA when they went out, they would use Uber or one of \nthem would be a designated driver. (Tr. at 74.) She testified since the TIA he had followed \nthe doctor\u2019s advice and had not consumed any alcohol. (Tr. at 75.) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person.

An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \nAnalysis \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nThe security concern for alcohol consumption is set out in AG \u00b6 21: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions regarding his alcohol consumption and actions inconsistent \nwith his treatment recommendations raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 22. The following \nare potentially applicable in this case: \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder;  \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional (e.g., \nphysician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical social worker) \nof alcohol use disorder; \n(e) the failure to follow treatment advice once diagnosed; and  \n(f) alcohol consumption, which is not in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations, after a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder. \nConditions that could mitigate alcohol consumption security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 23. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it happened \nunder such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on \nthe individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol use, \nprovides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has demonstrated a \nclear and established pattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with \ntreatment recommendations; and \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along with any \nrequired aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations. \nApplicant realized that his alcohol consumption was a problem, and he voluntarily \nadmitted himself into detox. He completed the program. He did not abstain from alcohol \nand sought to develop a healthy relationship with alcohol. His wife supported him and \nworked with him to maintain that relationship. He modified his alcohol consumption and \nhis diagnosis improved. After Applicant suffered the TIA, he understood he had no choice \nto but to stop drinking and has abstained from alcohol since. Given his family support \nsystem, his modification of his alcohol consumption, the improved diagnosis by the \ngovernment\u2019s psychologist, the life altering TIA and subsequent abstinence from alcohol, \nApplicant realizes the consequences if he returns to drinking. He is committed to sobriety. \nI find that Applicant established a pattern of abstinence and that his past alcohol \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconsumption no longer casts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 23(a) and 23(d) are partially applicable. AG \u00b6 23(b) is applicable. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case and that there were no alcohol-related \nincidents away from work or at work. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline \nG in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant mitigated \nthe alcohol consumption security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:     \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \nFor Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

He worked for another government agency at \ntwo different locations from 2008 until he left to take his current position in July 2020. He \nseeks to retain a security clearance, which he has held since about 2008. He earned a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in 2002 and a master\u2019s degree in 2007. He is married with two \nchildren. (Transcript (Tr.) at 23-25; GE 1; AE B, G) \nApplicant has a history of medical and mental health problems, which he at one \ntime attributed to a possible Havana Syndrome-like attack. He reported odd behavior to \nthe other government agency as early as 2019, and he thought he may have been \ndrugged. (Tr. at 62; GE 5; AE B) \nApplicant\u2019s issues increased in the summer of 2020. He reported concerns to the \nother agency in July 2020, but he resigned before the agency could investigate. He \ncontinued to report targeting efforts against him to the agency after he resigned. (GE 5) \nIn late August 2020, the police took Applicant from his work to an emergency \nroom because of paranoia. He told his wife that he thought he had been drugged, and \nthe KGB wanted to kill him. He also thought his wife might have been a Russian spy. \nMedical records indicate he stated that for the previous four months, he felt paranoid \nwith anxiety. He told medical personnel that he had to constantly look over his shoulder \ndue to feeling that people were following him and wanted to \u201ckill\u201d him. He stated that the \npeople trying to kill him were the KGB. He thought the police officer who took him to the \nhospital and two hospital employees might \u201cbe under foreign influence.\u201d (Tr. at 26-27; \nApplicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 3, 5; AE B) \nApplicant was admitted to the psychological ward. He told medical personnel that \nhe thought he was being stalked, and he called the FBI. He stated that he had trouble \nconcentrating at work for the previous several years. He was convinced he was drugged \nand followed for the previous week. He thought he would be arrested after his discharge \nfrom the hospital. He was diagnosed with anxiety disorder unspecified. He was \ndischarged from the hospital the day after he was admitted. (Tr. at 27; Applicant\u2019s \nresponse to SOR; GE 3; AE B, I) \nApplicant returned home after his discharge and attempted \u201crelaxing exercises,\u201d \nbut his hallucinations worsened. He returned to the emergency room of the hospital in \nthe early morning of the next day. He complained of auditory hallucinations of footsteps, \nvoices, and clicking/popping noises. He also had visual and olfactory hallucinations. He \nstated that \u201cwhen [he] looked at someone\u2019s face, [he] couldn\u2019t see the individual\u2019s face, \nall [he] saw was a joker-like smile.\u201d He smelled \u201can Eastern-European perfume, like all \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe time, everywhere.\u201d While waiting to be seen, an unrelated Code Blue was called, \nwhich frightened Applicant. He was causing a scene and security was notified. He \nstated that he wanted to stay in the hospital until his hallucinations were completely \nresolved. He was told by medical personnel that it would be inappropriate to admit him \nfor those reasons as he was not a danger to himself or others. Applicant left the hospital \nbefore receiving discharge forms. (Tr. at 27-29, 35-36, 62-64, 103-104; Applicant\u2019s \nresponse to SOR; GE 3; AE B, I) \nAbout two weeks later in September 2020, Applicant was involuntarily admitted \nto a different hospital under an order of protected custody. He was an inpatient for about \nseven to eight days. He thought some of the other patients were planted there. He was \ndiagnosed with brief psychotic disorder and anxiety disorder, unspecified type. He was \nplaced on medication and remained in treatment at the hospital after his discharge on \nan outpatient basis until at least May 2022. Additional diagnoses include delusional \ndisorder (October 1, 2020); psychosis, unspecified psychosis type (November 2020); \ndelusional disorder currently in partial remission; and episode of recurrent major \ndepressive disorder, unspecified depression episode severity (August 6, 2021); \nparanoid personality disorder (October 22, 2021); and schizotypal personality disorder \n(January 7, 2022). The most recent diagnosis in the medical records from this hospital \nwas generalized anxiety disorder in May 2022 (Tr. at 28, 30-36, 61, 68; Applicant\u2019s \nresponse to SOR; GE 4; AE B) \nApplicant\u2019s parents live in the same state as Applicant, but in a different city. His \nfather reported to his local police department in May 2021 that he had several \nencounters with a woman who said she knew Applicant and had an unusual amount of \ninformation about him. He shared the information with Applicant\u2019s wife, who advised him \nto contact the police. He wrote in an affidavit: \nIt is my personal opinion that this woman specifically targeted me to try to \nlearn more information about [Applicant] and/or his family through \nextended conversations over lunch, and when the lunch strategy did not \nwork, through multiple phone conversations. It is also my personal opinion \nthat the woman\u2019s motives were nefarious. (AE M) \nApplicant submitted a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) in \nMay 2021. He reported his hospitalization in 2020. He wrote that he was drugged by \nforeign intelligence on U.S. soil. He wrote that he could not sleep for four days, \u201cwhich \nbrought on severe paranoia and delusions.\u201d He also wrote: \u201cI believe I was targeted at \nchurch and subsequently drugged by foreign intelligence.

He also reported his \nparents had been approached by foreign intelligence, and that his bible study class had \nbeen infiltrated. He asserted that the staff and patients at the psychiatric units of the \nhospital were staged and that his interactions with them were role-played for hostile \nintelligence purposes. He believed that hospital staff maliciously altered the results of \nhis toxicology report to reflect no evidence of opiates or other substances that would \nconfirm he was drugged. He felt he was being used as bait by U.S. intelligence \nagencies to draw out foreign intelligence actors. Applicant\u2019s employer issued an \nadverse information report about Applicant to the DoD in October 2021. (GE 5; AE B) \nApplicant submitted another SF 86 in February 2022. He reported similar \ninformation about his hospitalization in 2020, but his positioned softened. He wrote that \nhe \u201cmay have been targeted by malicious actors on U.S. soil.\u201d He wrote that he did \u201cnot \nknow if [he] was dosed/drugged, but [he] could not sleep for four days, which brought on \nsevere paranoia and delusions.\u201d He also wrote: \u201cIt is possible I was targeted at church \nby foreign intelligence. It is possible foreign intelligence has approached my family.\u201d (GE \n2) \nApplicant was evaluated by a clinical psychologist at the DoD\u2019s request in \nOctober 2022, with the following in the report as provided by Applicant: \nApplicant reported that he experienced a psychotic episode in September \n2020 whereby he experienced a 36-hour period of auditory hallucinations, \nvisual hallucinations, olfactory hallucinations, and delusions. He gave \nexamples of his psychotic content to include his belief that his wife was a \nRussian spy, hearing footsteps on stairs, hearing safes being opened, \nhearing dogs being killed, seeing distorted faces of actual people that \nresembled the movie character/villain \u201cJoker,\u201d and smelling a well-known \nRussian perfume on most everyone and everything. [Applicant] further \nnoted that this psychotic episode was preceded by a period of four days \nwith no sleep. . . .  \n[Applicant] asserted his belief that this psychotic episode was caused by \nan outside force, including possibly his being drugged. He stated that his \npsychiatrist told him that since he experienced all three hallucination types \n(i.e., visual, auditory, and olfactory) at once that this strongly suggested \nthat he was drugged. [Applicant] further relayed an unusual story that he \nviewed his bloodwork results (from his in-patient treatment for psychosis) \nduring a meeting with his physician whereby the blood marker \ntypes/names indicative of being drugged were bolded in the report (i.e., \nbolded means a significant finding), but that the blood marker numbers \nwere in the normal range. [Applicant] surmised that the blood marker \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nnumbers were changed to a normal level by someone to conceal that he \nwas drugged, but that the individual forgot to un-bold the blood marker \nnames. . . .  \nAnother possibility expressed by [Applicant] for his psychotic episode was \nthat he was subjected to Havana Syndrome, which he believed to be a \nreal possibility given his prior work [at the other government agency]. (GE \n6) \nThe psychologist noted that Applicant continued to be on medication, and he \ncontinued to receive biweekly outpatient psychiatric treatment. He found that Applicant \nmet the criteria for a diagnosable mental health condition. He found that Applicant\u2019s \ndiagnostic profile was delusional disorder, persecutory type, by history. He concluded: \n[Applicant] did not present with any condition (i.e., his current diagnosis is \n\u201cby history\u201d) that could pose a significant risk to his judgement, reliability, \nor trustworthiness concerning classified information. [Applicant\u2019s] future \nmental health with respect to his judgement, reliability, or trustworthiness \nwas admittedly very difficult to determine.  \n[Applicant] asserted that his documented psychotic episode with in-patient \npsychiatric hospitalization in 2020 was caused by an external force, which \nhe surmised was the result of his being drugged or subjected to Havana \nSyndrome. After a review of his medical records, I am skeptical about his \ndrugging and Havana Syndrome explanations for his psychotic episode in \n2020. [Applicant] experienced continued and documented mental health \nproblems with related treatments for at least 1.5 years after his initial \npsychotic episode; I find it highly unlikely that a drug would have continued \nnegative effects on his mental health functioning for 1.5 years. \nAdditionally, psychotic symptoms are not known symptoms of Havana \nSyndrome [web address omitted] as such, I am also skeptical that his \npsychotic episode in 2020 was caused by Havana Syndrome. As result, I \nhave concluded that his prior psychotic break in 2020 was more likely than \nnot an actual mental health condition not caused by external forces, such \nas drugs or otherwise.  \nI have serious concerns about the possibility of his relapse into a partial or \nfully delusional state as a mental health treatment record dated \n02/11/2022 indicated the need to return to an anti-psychotic medication \n(i.e., Aripiprazole) due to increased paranoia since discontinuation of \nRisperidone in December 2021; the diagnoses on this date were \nGeneralized Anxiety Disorder and Paranoid Personality Disorder. \n[Applicant] denied current anti-psychotic medication, so I am uncertain if \nhe continues to take Aripiprazole at the present time. I also consulted the \nDSM-5 for statistical estimates for a relapse specific to Delusional \nDisorder; however, the DSM-5 provided no such statistics. Therefore, \ngiven that there was at least some increase in delusions with need for \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nantipsychotic medication as recently as early 2022, the risk to judgment \nand reliability related to any future mental health problems is at least \nmedium. (Original was one paragraph. Breaks were added for easier \nreading.) (GE 6) \nApplicant was evaluated by a clinical psychologist at his own expense in June \n2023. The psychologist\u2019s impressions included: \nBased on the data collected during the evaluation, [Applicant] likely meets \ncriteria for an anxiety disorder, although one which is very limited in scope \nand impairment. His episode which resulted in his hospitalization was \ncharacterized by a sudden onset of delusions, paranoia, and \nhallucinations which have remitted to relative baseline with treatment. (AE \nN) \nThe psychologist diagnosed Applicant with other specified anxiety disorder, with \nlimited symptom attacks; and brief psychotic disorder, without marked stressors \n(Stable). He provided the following prognosis: \n[Applicant\u2019s] prognosis is favorable. This opinion is evidenced by the lack \nof current disqualifying symptoms or behaviors, his psychological stability \nover \na \nsustained \nperiod \nof \ntime, \nhis \nadherence \nto \nmedical \nrecommendations and treatments, and the quality feedback of his \nreferences. Although [Applicant\u2019s] previous episode was sudden and \nwithout an identifiable reason, his response and willingness to seek \nassistance through both law enforcement and medical professionals are \nboth positive indicators. It is likely that [Applicant\u2019s] brief psychotic disorder \nwas caused by a confluence of situational factors and not an underlying \npsychological defect. As such, it is the opinion of the Evaluator that \n[Applicant\u2019s] judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness are currently intact. \n(AE N) \nApplicant has continued with therapy and medication. (Tr. at 43, 46-50, 97; \nApplicant\u2019s response to SOR; AE H, I, K, L) His therapist noted in January 2024: \n[Applicant] has shown stability in his thoughts and actions. He has been \nconsistent in his therapy and an engaged participant in working through \nthe difficult event that led to his brief psychotic episode. . . . [He] does not \nshow signs of impairment in his personal or professional life. . . . [He] has \na stable marriage and two young children and seems to make friends \neasily.

(Tr. at 13-22; \nAE D-F) \nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) \nThe DSM-5 is the standard classification of mental disorders used by mental \nhealth professionals in the United States. The following is summarized from the DSM-5: \n \n \nDelusional Disorder \nThe essential feature of delusional disorder is the presence of one or more \ndelusions that persist for at least one month. Delusions are fixed beliefs that are not \namenable to change in light of conflicting evidence. \nPersecutory type applies when the central theme of the delusion involves the \nindividual\u2019s belief that he or she is being conspired against, cheated, spied on, followed, \npoisoned or drugged, maliciously maligned, harassed, or obstructed in the pursuit of \nlong-term goals. \nA common characteristic of individuals with delusional disorder is the apparent \nnormality of their behavior and appearance when their delusional ideas are not being \ndiscussed or acted on. \n \n \nBrief Psychotic Disorder \nThe essential feature of brief psychotic disorder is a disturbance that involves the \nsudden onset of at least one of the following positive psychotic symptoms: delusions, \nhallucinations, disorganized speech (e.g., frequent derailment or incoherence), or \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \ngrossly abnormal psychomotor behavior, including catatonia. An episode of the \ndisturbance lasts at least one day but less than one month, and the individual eventually \nhas a full return to the premorbid level of functioning. \n \n \nParanoid Personality Disorder \nThe essential feature of paranoid personality disorder brief psychotic disorder is \na pattern of pervasive distrust and suspiciousness of others such that their motives are \ninterpreted as malevolent.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline I: Psychological Conditions \nThe security concern for psychological conditions is set out in AG \u00b6 27: \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair \njudgment, reliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is \nnot required for there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified \nmental health professional (e.g., clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) \nemployed by, or acceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, \nshould be consulted when evaluating potentially disqualifying and \nmitigating information under this guideline and an opinion, including \nprognosis, should be sought. No negative inference concerning the \nstandards in this guideline may be raised solely on the basis of mental \nhealth counseling. \nAG \u00b6 28 provides conditions that could raise psychological conditions security \nconcerns. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) behavior that casts doubt on an individual\u2019s judgment, stability, \nreliability, or trustworthiness, not covered under any other guideline and \nthat may indicate an emotional, mental, or personality condition, including, \nbut not limited to, irresponsible, violent, self-harm, suicidal, paranoid, \nmanipulative, impulsive, chronic lying, deceitful, exploitative, or bizarre \nbehaviors; \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the \nindividual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n(c) voluntary or involuntary inpatient hospitalization. \nAG \u00b6 28(a) \nApplicant reported in August and September 2020 that he thought he had been \ndrugged, and the KGB wanted to kill him. He reported auditory hallucinations of \nfootsteps, voices, and clicking/popping noises (visual and olfactory hallucinations were \nnot alleged in the SOR) (SOR \u00b6 1.a). AG \u00b6 28(a) is applicable to that behavior. \nApplicant submitted an SF 86 in May 2021. He reported his hospitalization in \n2020. He wrote that he was drugged by foreign intelligence on U.S. soil. He wrote that \nhe could not sleep for four days, \u201cwhich brought on severe paranoia and delusions.\u201d He \nalso wrote: \u201cI believe I was targeted at church and subsequently drugged by foreign \nintelligence.\u201d (SOR \u00b6 1.b). Applicant\u2019s reporting of his delusional beliefs establishes AG \n\u00b6 28(a) as a disqualifying condition. \nApplicant reported to his employer in October 2021 that he continued to be \nsubjected to \u201cactive measures\u201d by foreign intelligence, including continuous physical \nsurveillance of his movements; staged interactions with the same people over and over \ndesigned to ruin his life; drugging or poisoning his food; hacking the wi-fi at his home; \napproaching his parents; and infiltrating his bible study class (SOR \u00b6 1.d). AG \u00b6 28(a) is \napplicable, except for the language \u201capproaching your parents.\u201d That information was \nnot based on a delusion; it was based on a report by Applicant\u2019s father. \nApplicant submitted another SF 86 in February 2022. He reported similar \ninformation about his hospitalization in 2020, but his position softened. He wrote that he \n\u201cmay have been targeted by malicious actors on U.S. soil.\u201d He wrote that he did \u201cnot \nknow if [he] was dosed/drugged, but [he] could not sleep for four days, which brought on \nsevere paranoia and delusions.\u201d He also wrote: \u201cIt is possible I was targeted at church \nby foreign intelligence. It is possible foreign intelligence has approached my family\u201d \n(SOR \u00b6 1.f). \nBecause Applicant phrased the actions not as fact, but as a possibility, I do not \nfind it rises to the level of behavior that casts doubt on his judgment, stability, reliability, \nor trustworthiness. AG \u00b6 28(a) is not applicable as a disqualifying condition to the 2022 \nSF 86. SOR \u00b6 1.e is concluded for Applicant. The information will be considered when \ndetermining whether other allegations are mitigated. \nAG \u00b6 28(b) \nAG \u00b6 28(b) requires 1) an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional \nthat the individual has a condition; and 2) that the condition may impair judgment, \nstability, reliability, or trustworthiness. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant was diagnosed at his treating hospital with \nanxiety disorder, unspecified (SOR \u00b6 1.a), brief psychotic disorder, delusional disorder, \nparanoid personality disorder and generalized anxiety disorder (SOR \u00b6 1.b). Some \nconditions clearly impair judgment, stability, reliability, and trustworthiness, and by their \nvery nature raise security concerns, and can be accepted as such without further \nelaboration by the mental health professional: Other conditions may require elaboration \nby the mental health professional as to how the condition may impair the individual\u2019s \njudgment, stability, reliability, or trustworthiness. \nBrief psychotic disorder, delusional disorder, and paranoid personality disorder \nfall into the category of conditions that by their very nature raise security concerns. AG \u00b6 \n28(b) is applicable to those diagnoses. General anxiety disorder does not. See, e.g., \nUSAF-M Case No. 23-00056-R at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 4, 2024). AG \u00b6 28(b) is not \napplicable to that diagnosis. The language in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b referring to general \nanxiety disorder, unspecified, and generalized anxiety disorder is concluded for \nApplicant. \nThe psychologist who conducted the DoD-requested evaluation found that \nApplicant\u2019s diagnostic profile was delusional disorder, persecutory type, by history (SOR \n\u00b6 1.f). He concluded that Applicant \u201cdid not present with any condition (i.e., his current \ndiagnosis is \u201cby history\u201d) that could pose a significant risk to his judgement, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness concerning classified information.\u201d \nAG \u00b6 28(b) requires an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that \nthe individual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness. The evaluating psychologist determined that Applicant had a condition \nthat may impair judgment, stability, reliability, or trustworthiness. I find that opinion and \nthe psychologist\u2019s additional opinions are clearly relevant to whether other allegations \nare established and mitigated, but they do not establish AG \u00b6 28(b) as a disqualifying \ncondition. Additionally, since a diagnosis of delusional disorder is already alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 1.b, the DoD psychologist\u2019s referring back to that diagnosis is duplicative of the \ndiagnosis alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b. SOR \u00b6 1.f is concluded for Applicant. \nAG \u00b6 28(c) \nApplicant was an inpatient for a mental health condition (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b). \nAG \u00b6 28(c) is applicable. \nAG \u00b6 29 provides conditions that could mitigate psychological conditions security \nconcerns. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, and the \nindividual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with the \ntreatment plan;  \n(b) the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment \nprogram for a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \ncurrently receiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a \nduly qualified mental health professional; \n(c) recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional employed \nby, or acceptable to and approved by, the U.S. Government that an \nindividual\u2019s previous condition is under control or in remission, and has a \nlow probability of recurrence or exacerbation; \n(d) the past psychological/psychiatric condition was temporary, the \nsituation has been resolved, and the individual no longer shows \nindications of emotional instability; and \n(e) there is no indication of a current problem. \nApplicant reported odd behavior to the other government agency as early as \n2019, and he thought he may have been drugged. His issues increased in the summer \nof 2020. He reported concerns to the other agency in July 2020, but he resigned before \nthe agency could investigate. He continued to report targeting efforts against him to the \nagency after he resigned. \nApplicant was taken to the hospital and hospitalized in late August and \nSeptember 2020. He thought he had been drugged, he was being followed, and the \nKGB wanted to kill him. He had auditory hallucinations of footsteps, voices, and \nclicking/popping noises; visual hallucinations of people\u2019s faces looking like the Joker; \nand olfactory hallucinations of smelling \u201can Eastern-European perfume, like all the time, \neverywhere.\u201d \nApplicant has been on medication and receiving treatment since 2020. By all \naccounts he is doing much better. He has not had any additional hallucinations. His \ndelusions continued to October 2021 when he reported to his employer\u2019s security office \nthat he continued to be subjected to \u201cactive measures\u201d by foreign intelligence. He \nreported repeated attempts to compromise his health through \u201cHavana Syndrome,\u201d \ndrugging or poisoning his food and exposing him to noxious chemicals; hacking the wi-fi \nat his home; foreign intelligence approaching his parents; his bible study class had been \ninfiltrated; staff and patients at the psychiatric units of the hospital were staged; his \ntoxicology report altered to reflect no evidence of opiates or other substances; and he \nfelt he was being used as bait by U.S. intelligence agencies to draw out foreign \nintelligence actors. \nDuring his psychological evaluation in October 2022, Applicant described his \npsychotic break in 2020, but he still believed it was caused by an outside force, possibly \nhis being drugged. He also believed his blood work from the hospital had been altered \nto make it appear normal. He testified that he believed in 2020 that he was drugged, \nand he was \u201cmostly convinced in 2021\u201d that he was drugged. Now, he just does not \nknow if he was drugged. \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPositive factors for Applicant include the evaluation of the clinical psychologist at \nhis own expense in June 2023, who gave him a favorable prognosis; favorable \ncomments by his therapist and psychiatrist; and lay testimony. I note that Applicant\u2019s \npsychiatrist reported in January 2024 that Applicant\u2019s diagnoses included generalized \nanxiety disorder, brief psychotic disorder, and delusional disorder. \nApplicant is doing well at his job. That is not inconsistent with a delusional order \ndiagnosis. As noted in the DSM 5, a common characteristic of individuals with \ndelusional disorder is the apparent normality of their behavior and appearance when \ntheir delusional ideas are not being discussed or acted on. A witness and several \nauthors noted that they never observed anything of concern about Applicant. The \nwitness stated that the information alleged in the SOR \u201cseems incongruent\u201d and that \u201c[i]t \nseems like what is being described is a different person.\u201d The witness indicated that \nApplicant brought indicators or espionage, such as possibilities of surveillance, to his \nattention a \u201cfew times a month.\u201d \nApplicant is commended for seeking help with his mental health issues, and for \nhis positive job performance. While it cannot be completely eliminated that Applicant \nwas the target of hostile acts by a foreign intelligence, and in that regard, I considered \nhis father\u2019s affidavit. However, it is far more likely that most of his beliefs were \ndelusions. I agree with the psychologist who performed the DoD evaluation and \nconcluded: \nI have serious concerns about the possibility of his relapse into a partial or \nfully delusional state as a mental health treatment record dated \n02/11/2022 indicated the need to return to an anti-psychotic medication \n(i.e., Aripiprazole) due to increased paranoia since discontinuation of \nRisperidone in December 2021 . . . . Therefore, given that there was at \nleast some increase in delusions with need for antipsychotic medication as \nrecently as early 2022, the risk to judgment and reliability related to any \nfuture mental health problems is at least medium. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d None of the mitigating \nconditions, individually or collectively, are sufficient to mitigate the psychological \nconditions security concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline I in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s \nfavorable character evidence. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the security concerns under Guideline I. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline I: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst \nApplicant, \nexcept \nfor \nthe \nlanguage \u201cYou were diagnosed with \nAnxiety Disorder, Unspecified,\u201d which is \nfound For Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b: \nAgainst \nApplicant, \nexcept \nfor \nthe \nlanguage \n\u201cGeneralized \nAnxiety \nDisorder,\u201d which is found For Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d: \nAgainst \nApplicant, \nexcept \nfor \nthe \nlanguage \u201capproaching your parents,\u201d \nwhich is found For Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.e-1.f: \nFor Applicant \n14 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance.

Applicant did not wish to continue the \nhearing and decided not to offer this piece of evidence. (Transcript (Tr.) 11-15, 26-31) \n[Note: Since the piece of evidence was not offered, I did not identified it for the record, \nthough its identity is clear from the discussion during the hearing.] On my own motion, I \namended the SOR to correct the spelling of Applicant\u2019s last name by removing the \u201ch.\u201d I \nreceived the transcript of the hearing on June 11, 2024. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 55-year-old employee of a government contractor for whom he has \nworked for about a year. He earned a master\u2019s degree in 2002. He was on active duty in \nthe U.S. Marine Corps from 1986 until 1994, when he earned an honorable discharge. \nHe has been married since 1999, and he has two adult children. (Tr. 40-45; GE 1, 2) \nIn the SOR, the Government alleged that Applicant had a delinquent credit card \ntotaling about $6,000 (SOR \u00b6 1.a). He admitted this SOR allegation. His admission is \nadopted as a finding of fact. The Guideline F allegation is established through his \nadmission and the Government\u2019s 2023 credit report. This credit report reflects a \nNovember 2016 date of last activity, and an October 2017 date that a first major \ndelinquency was reported. (SOR; Answer; GE 1-3; AE G) \nApplicant began having financial issues in 2015 after he stopped working in the \noil and gas industry, resulting in a significant pay cut. His health insurance premiums \nalso went from $200 to $2,000, but they have since returned to a more affordable \namount. After his financial issues began, he had several delinquent debts that were not \nalleged in the SOR. He listed these delinquent debts in his September 2019 Electronic \nQuestionnaires for Investigations Processing (SF 86) and referenced them during his \nApril 2020 security interview. He paid some of these delinquencies but allowed some to \nage off his credit report. He did not provide evidence of which debts he paid versus \nwhich debts aged off. He cannot recall whether he paid the SOR debt, or if it aged off \nhis credit report, and he provided no documents to clarify its status. He planned to sell \nhis home to use the significant equity to satisfy the SOR account and other delinquent \naccounts, but questions surrounding his security clearance eligibility, the COVID-19 \npandemic, and his children\u2019s changing plans delayed his ability to do so. He still plans \non selling the home, but he has been planning on doing so since 2018. The credit report \nthat he provided showed no delinquencies, and he claimed that he is able to pay his \nfinancial obligations. (Tr. 45-49, 76-78; Answer; GE 1-3; AE A, D, G) \nOn or about February 5, 2019, Applicant was arrested on suspicion of driving \nunder the influence of alcohol (DUI). He was charged with DUI, reckless driving \ninvolving alcohol, and careless driving.

During his April 2020 security \ninterview, he told a DOD investigator that he had only had one glass of wine. His \nmedical records also reflect that he told a medical doctor that he had only had one glass \nof wine with dinner.

He testified that he remembers driving home and was sitting in \nhis car listening to a song he liked, and he \u201cfell asleep.\u201d When he parked, he grazed \nanother vehicle, and a neighbor called the police. He testified that he does not recall \ngrazing another vehicle but claimed the parking spots are narrow and the damage was \nminor. (Tr. 49-53; Answer; GE 1, 2, 4-6; AE B, C, F, G) \nWhen police arrived, they found Applicant \u201casleep\u201d at the wheel of his car. \nApplicant was awakened by police tapping on his car window and was confused and \ndisoriented. Police suspected him of DUI and attempted to give him a field sobriety test \nand a breathalyzer test, but he refused both. He claims he does not remember refusing \nthese tests but does remember thinking that a blood test would be more accurate. As he \ninformed the police that he was having a medical incident, and he was confused and \ndisoriented, police took him to a hospital (Hospital A) for testing and observation. At \nsome point after being awoken by the police, but before arriving at Hospital A, he \nracially abused a police officer and insulted the police officer\u2019s intelligence. He also \nmade a comment that either the police officer might as well shoot him in the head with a \n.50 caliber weapon, or that Applicant would shoot himself in the head with a .50 caliber \nweapon. He also said his life was over. (Tr. 53-59, 69-72, 88-89; Answer; GE 1, 2, 4; AE \nB, E, F, G) \nApplicant claimed that he was behaving erratically for several reasons, to wit: he \nwas having a diabetic episode; he was frustrated that he was being unjustifiably \ncharged with DUI; and he thought he would lose his job because of the arrest. He also \nclaimed that he referenced being shot with a .50 caliber weapon sarcastically. He \nclaimed that he did not remember making any of the statements to the police officer \nuntil he was able to review the video and audiotape of the arrest. There is no evidence \nin the record to explain how he remembered his state of mind during the arrest (furious, \nsarcastic, afraid of losing his job, thinking that a blood test would be more accurate) but \ndoes not recall the statements he made. This inconsistency detracts from his credibility \nand leads me to believe he remembers these statements and was conscious of making \nthem during the incident. Regardless of the nature of this comments or whether he \nremembered making them, the result was that the trip to the hospital became one to \nassess his mental as well as his physical health. At Hospital A, he spent about two \nhours undergoing a physical and mental assessment where a registered nurse reported \nthat he was not verbalizing or displaying self-injurious thoughts or behavior. However, \nHospital A recommended that he receive treatment at an inpatient psychiatric facility. \n(Tr. 53-59, 69-72, 78-81; Answer; GE 1, 2, 4; AE B, E, F, G) \nAfter Applicant was discharged from Hospital A, he was taken to jail.

An MD\u2019s discharge diagnosis from Hospital B was acute \nreaction to severe stress, unspecified, and adjustment disorder: unspecified trauma and \nstressor related disorder.

However, because of his past diagnosis of major depressive disorder, \nand his history of implied suicidal ideation with a plan, she diagnosed him with major \ndepressive disorder, unspecified.

(GE \n5) \nApplicant testified that his energy levels are low, that he always feels tired, and \nthat he sleeps a lot. He does not know the exact cause of his tiredness but speculated \nthat it could be because of getting older, the medication he takes, or his lengthy \ncommute. He also testified that he has lost interest in activities he used to engage in \nsuch as playing pool and tennis. His wife has not mentioned to him that he seems \ndepressed, but he noted that she works two jobs, and they both sleep a lot. He has \ncompleted training courses involving insider threats and security awareness.

The evaluating psychologist did not \nspecifically reference the DSM-5, but DSM-5 terminology was used in the report. The \nfollowing is summarized from the DSM-5: \nMajor Depressive Disorder  \nThe criterion symptoms for major depressive disorder must be present nearly \nevery day to be considered present, except for weight change and suicidal ideation. \nFatigue and sleep disturbance are present in a high proportion of cases; psychomotor \ndisturbances are much less common but are indicative of greater overall severity, as is \nthe presence of delusional or near-delusional guilt. \nThe essential feature of a major depressive episode is a period of at least two \nweeks during which there is either depressed mood or the loss of interest or pleasure in \nnearly all activities. Many individuals report or exhibit increased irritability (e.g., \npersistent anger, a tendency to respond to events with angry outbursts or blaming \nothers, an exaggerated sense of frustration over minor events). \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant had a delinquent SOR debt totaling about $6,000 that was delinquent \nsince October 2017. The above-referenced disqualifying conditions are established. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant did not provide sufficient evidence that he resolved the SOR debt. He \nis not sure whether he paid the account or whether it aged off his credit report. If the \nSOR account aged off his credit report, this outcome does not show that he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances or that he initiated a good-faith effort to repay or \nresolve the debt. He provided no documentation to show whether or how he resolved it. \nIt is reasonable to expect Applicant to present documentation about the resolution of \nspecific debts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-03363 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2016). He \nhas not provided evidence that he has undergone financial counseling. \nThrough his credit report, Applicant has provided documentary evidence that he \ndid not have any reported delinquent debts, and there is no record evidence to the \ncontrary. However, other than this failure to appear on his credit report, there is no \nevidence to show whether he resolved the delinquent debts that he referenced in his SF \n86 and during his April 2020 security interview. I have not used any adverse information \nnot alleged in the SOR for disqualification purposes. I have considered it when \nassessing the application of mitigating conditions and for the whole-person analysis. \nConsidering these non-SOR debts in the context of mitigation, it is unclear which of \nthem aged off his credit report or which he resolved through payment. Without this \nevidence, Applicant failed to meet his burden to prove that his financial issues are \nbehind him, that they are unlikely to recur, or that he acted responsibly or in good faith \nwith respect to those debts. None of the Guideline F mitigating conditions fully apply. \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nThe security concern for alcohol consumption is set out in AG \u00b6 21: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 22. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder; \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional \n(e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical \nsocial worker) of alcohol use disorder;  \n(e) the failure to follow treatment advice once diagnosed; and \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(f) alcohol consumption, which is not in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations, after a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder. \nSOR \u00b6 2.a alleges Applicant\u2019s 2019 DUI arrest. There is insufficient evidence that \nhis blood alcohol content was over the legal limit when he was arrested on suspicion of \nDUI. There is no evidence of the results of a blood test for alcohol or a breathalyzer test \nduring or immediately after he was detained. He also may have been suffering from a \ndiabetic incident. For these reasons, there is insufficient evidence that he was driving \nunder the influence of alcohol in February 2019. AG \u00b6 22(a) is not established and I find \nfor Applicant with respect to SOR \u00b6 2.a. \nI also find for Applicant with respect to SOR \u00b6 2.b. That SOR paragraph alleges \nthat medical records from February 2019 note that he has a past medical history of \nalcohol dependence. However, the record does not show that a qualified medical or \nmental health professional made this diagnosis or the basis upon which it was made. \nAG \u00b6 22(d) is not established by this allegation. \nAG \u00b6 22(d) is established by the Psychologist\u2019s October 17, 2022 diagnosis of \nApplicant\u2019s alcohol use disorder, mild, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.c. The burden thereby \nshifts to Applicant to provide evidence in mitigation. \nAG \u00b6 22(e) and AG \u00b6 22(f) are not established. While Applicant continued to \nconsume alcohol between October 2022 and May 2023 (after the alcohol use disorder \ndiagnosis by a qualified mental health professional), it is unclear whether the \nPsychologist affirmatively advised him to abstain or shared her diagnosis with him. This \nlack of clarity is further enforced by her role as evaluator and assessor rather than \ntreatment provider. Despite the February 2019 medical records noting a past history of \nalcohol dependence, there is no evidence as to who made that diagnosis or why it was \nmade. Therefore, for purposes of disqualification pursuant to AG \u00b6 22(e) and AG \u00b6 22(f), \nApplicant\u2019s continued consumption of alcohol from February 2019 until May 2023 was \nneither a failure to follow treatment advice once diagnosed by a qualified mental health \nprofessional [emphasis added], nor consumption after a diagnosis of alcohol use \ndisorder. \nConditions that could mitigate alcohol consumption security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 23. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations. \nWhile it did not meet the technical requirements for disqualification, I will still \nanalyze Applicant\u2019s decision to continue to consume alcohol daily from February 2019 \nuntil May 2023 for purposes of mitigation. An MD advised him to stop drinking in \nFebruary 2019. From February 2019, at the latest, he knew he had several chronic \nhealth issues that were either caused by or made worse by consuming alcohol, yet he \ncontinued to drink daily. Despite the MD\u2019s recommendation, his legal issues, and his \nhealth problems, he has repeatedly denied having a problem with alcohol. These factors \ncast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. \nWhile Applicant has now abstained from alcohol for a little over a year for health \nreasons, the vastly higher number of years that he consumed alcohol despite his issues \nwith it cause me to doubt whether he has demonstrated a clear and established pattern \nof modified consumption or abstinence. None of the Guideline G mitigating conditions \nfully apply. \nGuideline I: Psychological Conditions \nThe security concern for psychological conditions is set out in AG \u00b6 27: \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair \njudgment, reliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is \nnot required for there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified \nmental health professional (e.g., clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) \nemployed by, or acceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, \nshould be consulted when evaluating potentially disqualifying and \nmitigating information under this guideline and an opinion, including \nprognosis, should be sought. No negative inference concerning the \nstandards in this guideline may be raised solely on the basis of mental \nhealth counseling. \nAG \u00b6 28 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable in this case: \n(a) behavior that casts doubt on an individual\u2019s judgment, stability, \nreliability, or trustworthiness, not covered under any other guideline and \nthat may indicate an emotional, mental, or personality condition, including, \nbut not limited to, irresponsible, violent, self-harm, suicidal, paranoid, \nmanipulative, impulsive, chronic lying, deceitful, exploitative, or bizarre \nbehaviors;  \n(b) an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the \nindividual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n10 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n(c) voluntary or involuntary inpatient hospitalization. \nAs alleged in SOR \u00b6 3.a, in February 2019, Applicant either asked a police officer \nto shoot him in the head or stated that he would shoot himself in the head because he \nwas being arrested on suspicion of DUI. As a result of this incident, he was involuntarily \nhospitalized for two days, where he was diagnosed with depressive disorder and \nadjustment disorder. AG \u00b6\u00b6 28(a) and 28(c) are established. \nAG \u00b6 28(b) is not established. While qualified mental health professionals opined \nthat Applicant had adjustment disorder and major depressive disorder, as alleged in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a and 3.b, there is insufficient evidence to show that those conditions may \nimpair judgment, stability, reliability, or trustworthiness. The Psychologist diagnosed \nApplicant with alcohol use disorder and opined that Applicant\u2019s continued use of alcohol \ncaused her to have significant concerns regarding his judgment, stability, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness. Therefore, she related the alcohol use disorder with her concerns about \nhis judgment, stability, reliability, or trustworthiness, but not the adjustment disorder or \nmajor depressive disorder. Under Guideline I, the SOR alleged the adjustment disorder \nand major depressive disorder, but not the alcohol use disorder. \nAG \u00b6 29 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(d) the past psychological/psychiatric condition was temporary, the \nsituation has been resolved, and the individual no longer shows \nindications of emotional instability; and \n(e) there is no indication of a current problem. \nApplicant has not displayed signs of suicidal ideation or thoughts of self-harm \nsince 2019. There is some evidence that this behavior was episodic and caused by the \nstress of being arrested for DUI and potentially losing his job. That DUI and the potential \nfor losing his job as a result have been resolved. However, in November 2022, the \nPsychologist diagnosed him with a depressive disorder and an adjustment disorder. \nShe did not opine whether these conditions are temporary, and there is evidence that \nhe exhibits several of the symptoms of major depressive order according to DSM-5. \nTherefore, I will not find that the past psychological condition was temporary or that \nthere is no indication of a current problem. AG \u00b6\u00b6 29(d) and 29(e) do not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines F, G, and I in my whole-person analysis. I have also \nconsidered what I considered to be Applicant\u2019s lack of candor and selective memory \nabout the events surrounding his 2019 arrest, as well as his honorable military service, \nand his security training. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations, the alcohol consumption, or the psychological \nconditions security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline G: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline I:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 3.a-3.b: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

I convened the \nhearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 7 were admitted in evidence \nwithout objection.1 Applicant testified and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through \nG, which were admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on May 13, \n2024.  \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 64-year-old senior system specialist employed by a federal \ncontractor since July 2019. He served on active duty in the U.S. Air Force from June 1981 \nto July 1991 and received an honorable discharge. He received a security clearance in \nJanuary 1982. He married in July 1984, divorced in March 1999, married in April 2001, \ndivorced in December 2012, and married in July 2015. He has two adult children and an \ninfant son. \nApplicant obtained two associate degrees in March 1990 and August 1991. He is \ntaking college courses for a bachelor\u2019s degree in computer networks and cyber security, \nbut he has not yet received his degree. \nIn 1986, while Applicant was on active duty overseas in the Air Force, he became \nconcerned about his excessive alcohol consumption. He told his commander about his \nconcerns, and his commander recommended that he participate in one of the command\u2019s \nout-patient programs. He completed the program, attended Alcoholics Anonymous \nmeetings, and stopped drinking. (Tr. 92-95, 103) \nApplicant abstained from alcohol until October 1998. He became depressed \nbecause his first marriage was failing, and he attempted suicide by drinking a large \namount of alcohol and ingesting a large quantity of salicylates (aspirin). He was \nhospitalized for about a month for mental health treatment and evaluation. (Tr. 104) He \ndid not resume drinking after this incident. (Tr. 106) \nApplicant\u2019s second divorce was amicable. He and his wife grew apart due to his \nextensive service overseas, including active combat zones in Iraq and Afghanistan from \n2005 until 2013. He testified that they remain \u201cthe best of friends.\u201d (Tr. 112) \nApplicant met his third and current wife while they were both employed by \ncontractors overseas. They both wanted to have children, but they were not immediately \nsuccessful. (Tr. 122-23) Their multiple failed attempts to have children through in vitro \nfertilization caused frequent and intense arguments. Their marital stress increased when \nthree of his wife\u2019s immediate family members passed away.

He was \nhospitalized for five days to overcome the effects of the antifreeze, and then voluntarily \nadmitted to a psychological ward for one week. He was diagnosed with bipolar I mood \ndisorder. (GX 5) He testified that he regularly attended counseling sessions in person \nuntil the COVID pandemic began. The hospital where he attended counseling attempted \nto transition to telemedicine, but with limited success. At the same time Applicant was \nworking two jobs, attending college classes, and dealing with increased COVID-related \nworkload. He found that the coping methods he had learned during counseling were \nhelpful. He ran out of his medications and could not refill them because of the COVID \nlockdown. (GX 5 at 1; Tr.167-68) \nApplicant testified that, on the advice of his attorney, he resumed counseling \naround April 2023. (Tr. 171) He insisted on face-to-face counseling, and he told his \ntherapist that he would like to start without medication so that nothing would be masked. \nHe testified that he is willing to resume medication if his current therapist considers it \nadvisable. He believes he will need treatment for the rest of his life. (Tr. 132-46, 48) \nMedical records submitted by Applicant reflect that he underwent a diagnostic \nevaluation on April 20, 2023, and had in-person counseling on five occasions in May \nthrough August 2022. He underwent a reassessment on August 23, 2023, had in-person \ncounseling twice in September and October 2023, and received telehealth counseling on \nnine occasions at two-to-three-week intervals from October 26, 2023, through March 28, \n2024. The clinical notes indicate that Applicant was eager to talk and expand his thoughts. \nThe efforts by Applicant and his wife to have a child have succeeded, and Applicant has \nrepeatedly told his therapists about the joy of his recent fatherhood, but his marital \nproblems are ongoing. (AX G) He testified that his counseling sessions have helped him \nto understand and deal with his marital stress. (Tr. 132-48) \nOn January 9, 2023, Applicant was evaluated by a licensed psychologist (Dr. L) at \nthe request of the DCSA CAS. Dr. L reviewed Applicant\u2019s history of excessive alcohol \nconsumption, suicide attempts, personal and social history, and record of medical and \npsychiatric treatment. She administered the Personality Assessment Inventory (PAI) and \nnoted that he appeared to be \u201cexceptionally engaged in positive impression management \nand seems unable or unwilling to admit to personal shortcomings.\u201d She concluded that \nhis personality profile \u201clikely reflects considerable distortion of his current psychological \nstate.\u201d \nDr. L noted that Applicant was diagnosed with bipolar I disorder in April 2019, and \nthat he began outpatient treatment, including individual psychotherapy and medication \nmanagement, for about one year beginning in May 2019. Dr. L noted that his treating \nlicensed clinical professional counselor (LCPC) opined that he did not have a condition \nthat could impair his judgment, reliability, or ability to safeguard classified national security \ninformation, but that the LCPC\u2019s favorable prognosis was conditional, with \u201clifelong \nmaintenance needed.\u201d Applicant told Dr, L he does not believe that he has bipolar I \ndisorder, but he admitted that he may have a bipolar II disorder. He told Dr. L that he \u201cgot \ncaught up in a busy life\u201d and stopped treatment in about September 2020.

As part of Dr. K\u2019s evaluation, she \nadministered a screening test for alcohol-use disorders, which reflected that Applicant\u2019s \nrisk for alcohol-related problems was low. (Tr. 31) Based on her psychological testing, \nshe testified that she would have agreed with Dr. L\u2019s evaluation in 2020, shortly after \nApplicant\u2019s suicide attempt, but she does not believe that the 2020 evaluation is valid at \nthe present time, because of the passage of time and the significant treatment received \nby Applicant since 2020. (Tr. 32-33) Although Dr. L diagnosed Applicant with bipolar I \ndisorder, Dr. K diagnosed him with bipolar II disorder. She explained that bipolar I disorder \nis characterized by manic episodes, where an individual engages in reckless and \nimpulsive behavior such as promiscuity or gambling and has delusions or hallucinations \nand grandiose thinking. Bipolar II disorder is less severe and is characterized by \nhypomanic episodes that are characterized by tunnel vision, pressured speech, and \ncircumstantial talking that jumps from subject to subject, but there is less reckless \nbehavior and fewer problems with relationships and employment. (Tr. 34-36) \nDr. K testified that the \u201cgold standard\u201d for treating bipolar disorder is a combination \nof psychotherapy and medication management. Some individuals need only \npsychotherapy. Dr. K noted that Applicant was previously diagnosed with an adjustment \ndisorder, but she has seen no evidence that Applicant currently has anxiety or depressive \nsymptoms. (Tr. 38) She testified that there appear to be no concerns regarding his \ntrustworthiness, reliability, or judgment at this time. (Tr. 39) She believes that the \nconcerns raised by Dr. L, based on Applicant\u2019s termination of treatment, have been \nmitigated by the insight Applicant has developed since resuming treatment. (Tr. 41-42) \nShe testified that she is aware that individuals with bipolar II disorder have a higher suicide \nrisk than those with Bipolar I disorder, because those with bipolar II disorder are often not \naware of the diagnosis and are less likely to be monitored or seek treatment. (Tr. 59-60) \nDr. K believes that there are no concerns regarding Applicant\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, or trustworthiness, so long as he continues his therapy and continues to use \nthe coping skills that he has developed and to retain and potentially improve the insights \nthat he has developed through counseling. (Tr. 52, 55-56) \nApplicant\u2019s project manager since November 2021, a retired Army colonel, has \nobserved him in a critical engineer position where his attention to detail and performance \nunder stress has continuously been assessed. He rates Applicant as among the top three \nof the twenty engineers assigned to his directorate. He states that Applicant has a flawless \nrecord and has repeatedly demonstrated sound and mature judgment. He has no \nreservations about Applicant remaining in his current position and keeping his security \nclearance.

He admires Applicant\u2019s attention to detail and constant \npractice of operational security. He considers Applicant trustworthy and reliable. (AX E at \n6) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan at 531. \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 (App. \nBd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan at 531.  \nAnalysis \nGuideline I, Psychological Conditions \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 27: \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair judgment, \nreliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is not required \nfor there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified mental health \nprofessional (e.g., clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) employed by, or \nacceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, should be consulted \nwhen evaluating potentially disqualifying and mitigating information under \nthis guideline and an opinion, including prognosis, should be sought. No \nnegative inference concerning the standards in this guideline may be raised \nsolely on the basis of mental health counseling. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe SOR alleges the following conduct:2 \nSOR \u00b6 1.a: Applicant sought treatment in 1986 for excessive alcohol consumption; \nSOR \u00b6 1.b: Applicant attempted suicide in or around October 1998 by drinking an \nexcessive amount of alcohol and taking a large quantity of salicylates (over the counter \npain medications); \nSOR \u00b6 1.c: Applicant was voluntarily hospitalized in October 1998 for mental health \ntreatment and evaluation; \nSOR \u00b6 1.d: Applicant attempted to commit suicide in or around April 2019 by \nconsuming antifreeze; \nSOR \u00b6 1.e: Applicant was voluntarily hospitalized in April 2019 and diagnosed with \nbipolar I mood disorder; \nSOR \u00b6 1.f: In or around 2019, a licensed clinical professional consultant opined \nthat a positive prognosis for Applicant required \u201clifelong maintenance\u201d; \nSOR \u00b6 1.g: In or around September 2020, Applicant decided to stop psychiatric \ntreatment against medical advice, and has received no mental health treatment since \nSeptember 2020; \nSOR \u00b6 1.h: During an evaluation by a licensed psychologist in January 2023, \nApplicant stated that he experienced passive suicidal ideations in late 2020; and \nSOR \u00b6 1.i: Applicant was evaluated by a licensed psychologist in January 2023, \nwho determined that he could experience a resurgence of depression or manic \nsymptoms; that he was at a greater risk of decompensation because he discontinued his \npsychiatric medication regimen; and that he had a psychological condition that could \naffect his ability or willingness to properly follow orders or perform sensitive duties; and \nthat his reliability, stability, and trustworthiness in safeguarding classified information was \nquestionable. \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all the allegations except SOR \u00b6 1.i, \nwhich he denied because had not received a copy of the medical evaluation on which \nSOR \u00b6 1.i was based. His admissions and the evidence submitted at the hearing establish \nthe following disqualifying conditions under this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 28(a): behavior that casts doubt on an individual's judgment, stability, \nreliability, or trustworthiness, not covered under any other guideline and that \nmay indicate an emotional, mental, or personality condition, including, but \nnot limited to, irresponsible, violent, self-harm, suicidal, paranoid, \n2  The SOR allegations have been paraphrased to eliminate specific names and unnecessary verbiage. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmanipulative, impulsive, chronic lying, deceitful, exploitative, or bizarre \nbehaviors; \nAG \u00b6 28(b): an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that \nthe individual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, \nor trustworthiness; \nAG \u00b6 28(c): voluntary or involuntary inpatient hospitalization; and \nAG \u00b6 28(d): failure to follow a prescribed treatment plan related to a \ndiagnosed psychological/psychiatric condition that may impair judgment, \nstability, reliability, or trustworthiness, including, but not limited to, failure to \ntake prescribed medication or failure to attend required counseling \nsessions. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 29(a): the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, \nand the individual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance \nwith the treatment plan; \nAG \u00b6 29(b): the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment \nprogram for a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is \ncurrently receiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a \nduly qualified mental health professional; \nAG \u00b6 29(c): recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional \nemployed by, or acceptable to and approved by, the U.S. Government that \nan individual's previous condition is under control or in remission, and has \na low probability of recurrence or exacerbation; \nAG \u00b6 29(d): the past psychological/psychiatric condition was temporary, the \nsituation has been resolved, and the individual no longer shows indications \nof emotional instability; and \nAG \u00b6 29(e): there is no indication of a current problem. \nAG \u00b6 29(a) is established. Applicant voluntarily sought treatment for excessive \nalcohol consumption in 1998 and has not consumed alcohol since October 1998. Expert \nwitnesses for both sides agreed that Applicant\u2019s bipolar disorder is controllable with \ntreatment. Although Applicant stopped receiving counseling in September 2020, he \ncontinued to take medications until he ran out during the COVID lockdown. He resumed \ncounseling in April 2023, albeit in part due to the encouragement of his attorney. He now \nattends counseling regularly.

However, Applicant\u2019s testimony and the testimony of Dr. \nK established that Applicant\u2019s return to counseling was an eye opener, and he realized \nthat it was the only path to a normal, productive life. He was genuinely enthusiastic at the \nhearing when he described how much he has benefited from his counseling. \nAG \u00b6 29(b) is established. Applicant is receiving counseling. He received a \nqualified favorable prognosis in May 2019, conditioned on \u201clifelong maintenance.\u201d He is \ncomplying with that condition. Dr. L had doubts about Applicant\u2019s reliability, stability, and \ntrustworthiness because he had not resumed treatment. Dr. K believes that there are no \nconcerns about his judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness because he has been regularly \nreceiving counseling since April 2023 and appears highly motivated to continue doing so. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is not established. While Dr. K is a highly qualified medical professional, \nshe is not \u201cemployed by, or acceptable to and approved by, the U.S. Government.\u201d \nAG \u00b6 29(d) is established for Applicant\u2019s excessive alcohol consumption. It is not \nestablished for his bipolar disorder, which is not a temporary condition. \nAG \u00b6 20(e) is established. Applicant has not consumed alcohol since October \n1998. He has not exhibited aberrant behavior since his suicide attempt in April 2019. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline I in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d).

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 59-year-old employee of a defense contractor who seeks a security clearance. The admitted allegations are incorporated and adopted as relevant and material findings. Additional findings follow. Background Applicant (then a citizen and resident of Iraq) married a citizen and resident of Iraq in 1987 and divorced her in 1997. (GE 1; Tr. 34) He has three children from this marriage (two sons and a daughter, ages 26, 24, and 18) who are citizens of Iraq and reside with his ex-wife in Iraq. (GEs 1-3; Tr. 40) Applicant maintains bi-monthly contact with his ex-wife. (Tr. 36) He sees his ex-wife (a retired pre-school teacher) when he makes his annual visits to Iraq to see his children. (Tr. 36) When asked, he acknowledged twice providing his ex-wife financial assistance ($200 to $300 at a time) to cover her medical treatments. (Tr. 38) His parents have never traveled to the United States. (Tr. 41-45) Applicant remarried in February 2008 and divorced in January 2017. (GE 1; Tr. 33) He has no children from this marriage. (GE 1) He remarried again in August 2023, this time to an Indonesian citizen and resident in what he characterized as a Muslim religious marriage without official recognition from either the Indonesian or U.S. governments.

Administrative Judge \nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, \nApplicant mitigated personal conduct concerns, but did not mitigate foreign influence \nconcerns relating to his connections to Iraq, Ukraine, Kenya, and Indonesia. Eligibility \nfor access to classified information or to hold a sensitive position is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn May 10, 2023, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA) \nCentral Adjudications Services (CAS) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant \ndetailing reasons why under the foreign influence guideline the DCSA CAS could not \nmake the preliminary affirmative determination of eligibility for granting a security \nclearance, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a \nsecurity clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.

At the hearing, the Government\u2019s case \nconsisted of two exhibits (GEs 1-2). Applicant relied on no exhibits and one witness \n(himself). The transcript (Tr.) was received on March 15, 2024. \nBesides its two exhibits, the Government requested administrative notice of facts \ncontained in five attachments related to the countries of Iraq, Ukraine, Indonesia, and \nKenya, with supporting attachments. Administrative or official notice is the appropriate \ntype of notice used for administrative proceedings. See ISCR Case No. 16-02522 at 2-3 \n(App. Bd.

Administrative notice is appropriate for noticing facts or \ngovernment reports that are well known. See Stein, Administrative Law, Sec. 25.01 \n(Bender & Co. 2006). Without objection, and for good cause shown, administrative \nnotice was granted with respect to the above-named background reports addressing the \ngeopolitical situations in Iraq, Ukraine, Indonesia, and Kenya. \nAdministrative notice was extended, without objection, to the documents \nthemselves, consistent with the provisions of Rule 201 of Fed.

The \noutcome of the October 2021 parliamentary elections generally met international \nstandards of free and fair elections. See Request for Administrative Notice-Federal \nRepublic of Iraq (Iraq) at 2 and 2022 Iraq Human rights Report at 1; U.S. Department of \nState (April 2023). The elections were observed by the European Union and domestic \ncivil society organizations and monitored by the United Nations Assistance Mission or \nIraq. (id) The 2021 elections were scheduled because of the widespread protests that \nbegan in October 2019 and led to the resignation of former prime minister Adil Abd al-\nMahdi in December 2019. Parliament, in turn, confirmed Prime Minister Mustafa al-\nKadhimi in May 2020. \nIn preparation for the 2021 national parliamentary elections, Iraq adopted a new \nelectoral law based on individual candidacy and local districts.

Whether the election results and formation talks will reduce the formal influence \nof Iran-aligned groups who seek to revise or rescind Iraq\u2019s invitation to U.S. military \nadvisors to remain in Iraq is unclear. \nFor historical perspective, in 2003, a U.S.-led coalition invaded Iraq and \nsucceeded in removing Saddam Hussein and his Ba\u2019athist regime from military and \npolitical power. See the World Factbook: Iraq, U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (Feb. \n2018); Background Note, Iraq, at 3, U.S. Dept. of State (Feb. 2008). After two years of \noperations under a provisional authority, Iraq\u2019s new government assumed office in \nMarch 2006 (with the approval of the U.S. government), following free elections. (id) \nSince March 2006, the government of Iraq has been comprised of a broad \ncoalition of political alliances representing the Shiite, Sunni, and Kurdish blocs. See the \nWorld Factbook: Iraq, supra, at 2; Background Note, Iraq, supra, at 8. While elections \nhave been held and concluded, none of the key constituent groups have been able to \nform a government, adopt an oil law, establish and maintain effective security \nthroughout the provinces, or neutralize sectarian divisions. In this still very fragile \npolitical environment in Iraq, there are substantiated reports of human rights abuses that \ncontinue to underscore a still pervasive climate of tension and violence. See Iraq 2022 \nHuman Rights Report, supra, at 2-3. \nPost-COVID-19 protests intensified in May 2021, with demonstrators insisting \nthat the government identify and prosecute suspects in a series of assassinations and \nkidnappings since 2020 of protest leaders, activists, and a prominent security \nresearcher. See Iraq and U.S. Policy, supra. Whatever government is able to survive \nthe competing Iraqi political blocks will continue to test the will of continued U.S. security \ncooperation and other bilateral ties against the security risks posed by Iraq\u2019s cited \npersistence of patronage politics, corruption, oil dependence, and armed non-state \nactors. See Request for Administrative Notice, Iraq, supra, at 2; Iraq and U.S. Policy, \nsupra, at 1-2, \nIraq\u2019s economy continues to be dominated by the oil sector, as it has for the past \nhalf century since the completion of new pipelines into Lebanon in 1949, and into Syria \nin 1952. See the World Factbook: Iraq, supra; Background Note, Iraq, supra. As a result \nof the U.S.-led invasion in 2003, much of Iraq\u2019s oil-refining capabilities were shuttered. \nThe rebuilding of oil infrastructure and utilities infrastructure has continued to expand \nsince 2004 with U.S. aid and support, despite setbacks from insurgent activity. \nProposed oil revenue-sharing legislation among the three war-hardened ethno-\nsectarian divisions (Shia, Sunni, and Kurds) still awaits passage after four years of \n7 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nstalled negotiations, and at the moment, there are no good estimates of when such \nlegislation will be approved and implemented.

For the foreseeable future, the national government can be expected to continue \nto seek the passage and implementation of a revenue sharing law to strengthen and \nencourage the development of this important sector.  \nPast budget laws passed by Iraq\u2019s national parliament requiring the Kurdistan \nRegional Government (KRG) to contribute certain export earnings in the country\u2019s \noverall exports (a law that would seem to validate the KRG\u2019s ownership claims to Kirkuk \noil) have never led federal authorities to export Kirkuk-produced oil. In so doing, Iraq\u2019s \nfederal authorities have severely limited Iraq\u2019s northern export outlet via the Kurdish \npipeline to Turkey. Breaking the oil-stalemate that existed for years between the KRG \nand Iraq\u2019s federal government can have major positive ramifications for not only Iraq \nand its oil exports, but for the United States and other Western interests as well. \nTerrorism and human rights issues \nDespite recent developments in its security enforcement efforts, Iraq remains a \nvery dangerous, volatile, and unpredictable country. The U.S. State Department \ncontinues to strongly warn U.S. citizens against traveling to Iraq. See Request for \nAdministrative Notice, Iraq, supra, at 2-5; Iraq Travel Advisory, U.S. Department of \nState (July 2023) \nThe U.S. State Department assessed Iraq as being a critical-threat location for \ncrime directed at or affecting official U.S. interests. See Country Reports on Terrorism \n2021, U.S. Dept. of State of State (Feb. 2023). After a year of stalemate and heightened \nintra-Shia violence following the elections of October 2021, Shia militias can be \nexpected to continue to pose a credible threat to U.S. forces in Iraq and the region. See \nid. \nAttacks against military and civilian targets throughout Iraq continue and include \nsites and facilities where foreign tourists frequently visit: hotels, restaurants, police \nstations, check points, foreign diplomatic missions, international organizations, and \nother locations with expatriate personnel. See Request for Administrative Notice, Iraq, \nsupra; Travel Advisory-Iraq, supra. The U.S. Embassy\u2019s ability to provide consular \nservices to U.S. citizens outside Baghdad is extremely limited under the security \nenvironment that still exists in Iraq. \nIn December 2015, President Obama signed into law the Visa Waiver Program \nImprovement and Terrorist Travel Protection Act of 2015, which amended the existing \nWaiver Program. See Request for Administrative Notice, supra, at 5-6.

Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988), \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a \nsecurity clearance.\u201d As Commander in Chief, \u201cthe President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. \nEligibility for access to classified information may only be granted \u201cupon a finding that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe AGs list guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision-making \nprocess covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that could \ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as \nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. \nThese AGs include conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of the conditions that could \nmitigate security concerns, if any. These guidelines must be considered before deciding \nwhether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued, or denied. Although, \nthe guidelines do not require judges to place exclusive reliance on the enumerated \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a decision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context \nof the whole person.

They may also be a national security \nconcern if they create circumstances in which the individual may be \nmanipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or \ngovernment in a way inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made \nvulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of \nforeign contacts and interests should consider the country in which the \nforeign contact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, \nconsiderations such as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain \nclassified or sensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n  Personal Conduct \nThe Concern: Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of \ncandor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, and trustworthiness, \nand ability to protect classified or sensitive information. Of special \ninterest is any failure to cooperate or provide truthful and candid answers \nduring national security investigative or adjudicative processes . . . AG \n\u00b6 15. \nBurdens of Proof \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours.

The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd.

Additional security concerns are raised over Applicant\u2019s \nomissions of his Iraqi contacts and relationships in the e-QIP he completed in February \n2022. \nConcerns associated with Applicant\u2019s family members in Iraq \nApplicant immigrated to the United States in 2010 after spending over four years \nin Ukraine while completing his graduate studies. In leaving Iraq, he left behind a host of \nimmediate family members. Still citizens and residents of Iraq are his parents, his two \nsons and a daughter, his two brothers and two sisters, and his ex-wife. Central to the \nGovernment\u2019s security concerns are his presumably close relations with his family \nmembers in Iraq. \nTerrorist attacks and human rights abuses run historically deep in Iraq and \ncontinue to plague the country with few signs of improvement.

Feb. 20, 2002) \nHeightened risk assessments require consideration of an applicant\u2019s interests \nand family ties in the country or countries of interest. The risk of coercion, persuasion, \nor duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government; \nthe government ignores the rule of law (including widely accepted civil liberties); a family \nmember is associated with or dependent upon the government; the government is \nengaged in a counterinsurgency; terrorists cause a substantial amount of death or \nproperty damage; or the country is known to conduct intelligence collection operations \nagainst the United States. With respect to Iraq, the country is certainly not free from \nrisks of potential hostage taking. Although, Iraq does maintain strong bilateral relations \nwith the United States and recognizes democratic principles of governance. \nTaken together, the personal and financial relationships Applicant has with Iraq \nand the situations that exist in this country, place a significant burden of persuasion on \nApplicant to demonstrate that his relationships with any family members holding Iraqi \ncitizenship and residence who hold both property on his behalf and property of their own \nsubject to inheritance rights favorable to Applicant and his siblings do not pose \nirreconcilable security risks. Such risks that cannot be reconciled or otherwise mitigated \ncould potentially place him in a position of having to choose between loyalty to the \nUnited States and a desire to assist a relative living in or visiting Iraq, or to take actions \nto protect his property interests (directly or indirectly) in Iraq. \nWhile Applicant\u2019s residual inheritance interests in his parents\u2019 Iraqi property are \ninchoate ones with the potential for change, his inheritance rights alone can be enough \nto present risks of irreconcilable conflicts of interest.

Although, his inheritance interest \nremains inchoate at this time, it has residual value and stands a reasonable chance of \nripening into a valuable asset to Applicant. Although, neither Applicant nor his parents \nor siblings have any direct or indirect control over any potential reversion exercise by \nthe Iraqi government. \nTrue, none of Applicant\u2019s parents, ex-wife, children, or siblings come with any \nhistory of being subjected to any coercion or pressure. These historical antecedents \nlimit the risk somewhat of any potential conflict situation. Still, while the absence of any \npast coercive measures taken by Iraqi authorities might limit their exposure to risks of \ncoercion, compromise or influence, it does not absolve Applicant from any risks of \ncoercive measures being taken against his parents, children, ex-wife, and siblings in the \nfuture given Iraq\u2019s checkered history of terrorism and human rights abuses. \n \nSignificant and pervasive are Iraq\u2019s intelligence-gathering capabilities and human \nrights abuses, and they need to be closely weighed along with the favorable bilateral \nrelations that exist between Iraq and the United States. These are among the most \nimportant considerations to be considered when assessing risks associated with an \napplicant\u2019s family ties and property interests in that country.

With the citizenship and resident status of Applicant\u2019s parents, \nex-wife, children, and siblings in Iraq posing heightened risks of coercion, compromise, \nand influence of Applicant, his inchoate inheritance rights pertaining to his parents\u2019 Iraqi \nproperty interests when considered together, enhance the level of risk Applicant faces \nso long as his family members remain in Iraq. \nAnd, although the measurables of Applicant\u2019s inchoate Iraqi inheritance rights \nremain uncertain, they reflect more than what he is able to claim title to in the United \nStates at this time. Without more evidence from Applicant on the state of his property \ninterests in the United States, MC \u00b6 8(f), \u201cthe value or routine nature of the foreign \nbusiness, financial, or property interests is such that they are unlikely to result in a \nconflict and could not be used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the \nindividual,\u201d is not available to Applicant. In sum, Applicant\u2019s connections to his parents, \nchildren, siblings, and ex-wife in Iraq, pose heightened risks to him and his family \nmembers holding Iraqi citizenship and residency, and considerable property interests in \nIraq. Applicant\u2019s lack of substantial assets in the United States and established track \nrecord of commitment to protecting U.S. security interests cannot be favorably \nreconciled with his close Iraqi relationships and financial interests in Iraq. \nConcerns over Applicant\u2019s relationships with foreign women  \nAdditional security concerns are raised over Applicant\u2019s online and in-person \nfriendships and romantic relationships he established with foreign women he met on \nonline dating websites and in some cases where he developed in-person friendships \nand relationships (all covered by SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g-1.p). While he has shuttered his foreign \ndating sites and converted most of his romantic relationships into friendships, he \ncontinues to maintain friendship contacts with several of these foreign women and \nretains an active romantic relationship with the Indonesian woman he married in a \nreligious ceremony in 2023. \nApplicant\u2019s friendships and relationships with women who are citizens and \nresidents of countries posing heightened risks to U.S. security interests create \ncontinuing security concerns under Guideline B. His friendships and relationships with \nforeign women reflect ones grounded in mutual affection and financial interests. DC \u00b6\u00b6 \n7(a) and 7(b) are fully applicable. Potentially applicable mitigating conditions are not \navailable to Applicant in resolving the allegations covered by SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g-1-p. \nPersonal conduct concerns \nSecurity concerns are also directed at Applicant\u2019s falsifications of the e-QIPs he \ncompleted in February 2022.

Trust and candor are core criteria for establishing eligibility to hold a \nsecurity clearance. The questions posed in the e-QIP were straightforward and not \ncomplicated for anyone with a working knowledge of English. \nWhile Applicant qualified the falsification allegations in the SOR (claiming his \nomissions to be mistakes), his e-QIP omissions support drawn inferences of material \nfalsification. In turn, his collective responses to the foreign contact-related questions in \nthe e-QIP he completed warrant the application of DC \u00b6 16(a), \u201cdeliberate omission, \nconcealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, \npersonal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine \nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.\u201d \nIn an ensuing PSI conducted by an OPM investigator in March 2022, Applicant \nfully and voluntarily disclosed (without any prompting or confronting by the interviewing \nagent) all of the details of his family members residing in Iraq and the financial support \nhe provided them. Without any confrontation, he also accounted for the Ukrainian, \nKenyan, and Indonesian women he established friendships and relationships with \nthrough internet dating sites and the financial support he provided them.

On November 3, \n2022, he provided a personal summary interview (PSI) to an investigator from the Office \nPersonnel Management (OPM). After examining the background investigation, the \nDefense Counterintelligence Security Agency (DCSA) Consolidated Adjudications \nServices (CAS) could not make the affirmative findings necessary to issue a security \nclearance. On June 30, 2023, the DCSA CAS issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to \nApplicant detailing security concerns under the guideline for drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse (Guideline H). The action was taken by the Defense Industrial \n\n \n  2 \n \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and Security Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing in Appendix A the \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to \nClassified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), made effective in \nthe Department of Defense (DOD) on June 8, 2017.  \n \nOn July 9, 2023, Applicant admitted the three allegations of the SOR, with \nexplanations. He decided to have his case evaluated administratively on the written \nrecord in lieu of a hearing. On August 2, 2023, the Government sent a copy of its File of \nRelevant Material (FORM), the Government\u2019s evidence in support of the allegations in \nthe SOR, to Applicant. He received the FORM on August 8, 2023. He was provided 30 \ndays after receipt of the FORM to submit a response. In his August 31, 2023 FORM-\nresponse to the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), he provided \nstatements stressing that he has been using marijuana sanctioned by the state since \n2017. The marijuana is used to treat his chronic pain related to migraine headaches. He \nuses the drug under the guidance of a state-approved physician, and purchases the \ndrug at state-approved medical dispensaries.

He \nindicated that he used the drug to the present (November 03, 2022). He ingested the \ndrug in the form of edibles, taking a piece of the drug before going to sleep. The drug \nhad no affect on him other than blunting the pain emanating from his head and his back. \nHe intentionally used the drug but was never involved in production or selling the drug. \nHe has never had a problem caused by his use of marijuana. He has never been \narrested because of his marijuana use and he has never been diagnosed for drug \nabuse. He does not associate with anyone who uses illegal drugs. He intends to use \nmarijuana in the future to manage his chronic pain. \u201cHowever, if the usage will prevent \nhim from getting a security clearance, he will stop its usage and seek out other methods \nto deal with his chronic pain.\u201d (Item 4 at 3) Applicant did not believed that any \ninformation in his background or personal conduct could make him susceptible to \ncoercion. (Item 4 at 4) \n \nThe DCSA CAS issued interrogatories to Applicant on February 2, 2023. (Item \n5 at 1-10) These interrogatories relate to Applicant\u2019s drug use. He admitted using \nmarijuana and not taking medication to help him abstain from illegal drug use. He did \nnot intend to illegally use drugs in the future. (Item 5 at 4) \n \nOn the next page of the interrogatories, Applicant provided information in a \nchart about his illegal drug use. The chart has five columns. Starting at the left side, in \nresponse to the first column labeled \u201cType of drugs or controlled substances illegally \nused,\u201d Applicant inserted \u201cMedical Marijuana.\u201d In response to the next column labeled \n\u201cFrequency of use,\u201d he supplied the following \u201cAt least once a day.\u201d In response to the \nthird column labeled \u201cDate of most recent illegal use of drugs or controlled substances,\u201d \nApplicant furnished the date \u201c2/13/2023.\u201d In response to the fourth column labeled \n\u201cAmount used per occasion,\u201d Applicant stated, \u201c10 mg. (milligrams).\u201d The fifth column is \nlabeled, \u201cIntend to continue future rate of illegal use,\u201d Applicant indicated \u201cYes.\u201d The \nnext question underneath the chart (#3) is the question \u201cHave you ever used marijuana \nbased upon a state  law \u201clegalizing\u201d or \u201cdecriminalizing\u201d marijuana use for medicinal or \nrecreational purposes?\u201d Applicant answered \u201cYes.\u201d (Item 5 at 5) \n \nIn response to interrogatory 4, Applicant provided a history of his marijuana \nuse, why he used the drug, and the state controlled procedures under which he uses \nthe drug. In response to interrogatories 5 and 6, Applicant indicated the drug had no \naffect on him and he had never been evaluated or treated for illegal drug use. (Item 5 at \n6)  \n \nIn response to interrogatories 7 and 8, Applicant had never used illegal drugs \nbefore or at work. He never failed a random drug test. He stated that he has never been \nterminated or asked to resign from a job for illegal drug use. His current employer has a \n\n \n  4 \n \ndrug policy and requires random drug tests. Applicant has not possessed a security \nclearance or a position of trust while holding a security clearance. (Item 5 at 7-8) \n \nUnder interrogatory 13, Applicant answered \u201cYes\u201d to understanding that \nmarijuana use remains illegal under Federal law and that any future use may affect his \nsecurity clearance eligibility. In response to question 14, Applicant answered \u201cYes\u201d to \nthe question of whether he intends to use illegal drugs or controlled substances in the \nfuture. His reason for continuing to use marijuana is the state medical use of marijuana \nlaw that authorizes the use depending on the severity of his chronic pain. (Item 5 at 9) \nIn reply to interrogatory 10, the additional information that Applicant provided was that \nhis job required a security clearance. (Item 5 at 10) On February 14, 2023, Applicant \nprovided his signature to the last page swearing that his responses to the 16 \ninterrogatories were true and correct. (Item 5 at 11) Because Applicant requested an \nadministrative  determination on the record without a hearing, I had no opportunity to \nassess his credibility or demeanor.  \n \nIn the first paragraph of his August 31, 2023 response to the FORM, Applicant \ndenied that he was placed on notice that legally prescribed marijuana was against \nFederal law. He denied stating he did not wish to stop using medical marijuana, but \ninstead stated that he is prepared to stop when he receives his security clearance. \nApplicant\u2019s legally prescribed use of marijuana does not show poor judgment and \nunreliability. On the contrary, the legally prescribed use, coupled with a personal and \nprofessional records, and the lack of any kind of negative record, shows dependability \nand responsibility. Further, his legally authorized marijuana use \u201clikely\u201d falls under Pub. \nL. 117-215, an act to expand research of marijuana, including section 202, and Food \nand Drug Administration (FDA) approved drugs, including Section 301 (Doctor-Patient \nRelationship) \n \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines, which should be applied \nwith common sense and the general factors of the whole-person concept. All available \nand reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, \nshould be carefully reviewed before rendering a decision. The protection of the national \nsecurity is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(d) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning \npersonnel being considered for national security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the \nnational security.\u201d Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to \nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \napplicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d \nThe applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security \ndecision. \n \n\n \n  5 \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \nThe security concern under the Drug Involvement/Substance Abuse Guideline \nis set forth in AG \u00b6 24: \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, \nrules, and regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled \nsubstance\" as defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the \ngeneric term adopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors \nlisted above. \n \nIn my analysis of this case, I have taken administrative notice of Executive \nOrder (E.O.) 12564 signed by the then-President of the United States on September 15, \n1986. The primary positions addressed in the E.O. are: (1) federal employees cannot \nuse illegal drugs; (2) illegal drug use by federal employees, on or off duty, is contrary to \nthe efficiency of the service; and (3) persons who use illegal drugs are not suitable for \nfederal employment.  \n \nI have also taken administrative notice of the Director of National Intelligence \nMemorandum Adherence of Federal Laws Prohibiting Marijuana Use, (October 25, \n2014), which clearly states that state laws do not authorize persons to violate federal \nlaw, including the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 801-971 (1970)), which \nidentifies marijuana as a Schedule 1 controlled drug.  \n \nChanges in state laws or the District of Columbia, pertaining to marijuana use \ndo not alter the existing National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (Security Executive \nAgent Directive 4 (SEAD 4), effective June 8, 2017). An individual\u2019s disregard of the \nfederal law pertaining to marijuana involvement remains adjudicatively relevant in \nnational security determinations.  \n \nOn December 21, 2021, the Director of National Intelligence signed the \nmemorandum, Security Executive Agent Clarifying Guidance Concerning Marijuana for \nAgencies Conducting Adjudications of Persons Proposed for Eligibility for access to \nClassified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position. Agencies are required to \n\n \n  6 \n \nemploy the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d stated under SEAD 4, to determine if an applicant\u2019s \nbehavior raises a security concern that has not been mitigated.  \n \nAG \u00b6 25. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying include: \n \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition);   \n \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution, or possession \nof drug paraphernalia; and \n \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, or failure to commit clearly and convincingly to discontinue such \nmisuse.  \n \nApplicant began using marijuana in June 2017 to the present. He used the drug \nregularly to treat his headaches and back pain. In his November 2022 PSI, after \ndescribing how he takes the marijuana, the frequency of his usage, and his intention to \nuse the drug in the future, he stated that if continued use would prevent him from getting \na security clearance, he would stop and seek out other methods to deal with his chronic \npain.  \n \nIn February 2023, Applicant replied affirmatively to interrogatory 13 \nunderstanding that marijuana use remains illegal under Federal law and that future use \ncould affect his security clearance eligibility. However, he intended to illegally use \nmarijuana in the future because it was authorized under the state medical use law. \nApplicant\u2019s illegal ongoing purchase and use of marijuana, and his intention to purchase \nand use the drug in the future falls within the scope of AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), 25(c), and 25(g). \n \nAG \u00b6 26. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n \n1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n\n \n  7 \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of \nnational security eligibility. \n \nApplicant\u2019s use of marijuana for about six years and his conscious decision to \ncontinue using the drug in the future, demonstrates poor judgment and unreliability that \nremoves AG \u00b6 26(a) from consideration. \n \nThough Applicant indicated in November 2022 that he would seek alternative \nmode of treatment if continued marijuana use hampered his chances of obtaining a \nsecurity clearance, there is no indication in the record that he found another course of \ntreatment. He has furnished no evidence of searching and finding an alternative \ntreatment.  \n \nThough Applicant admits his involvement with marijuana, he has furnished no \nindependent evidence of action taken to overcome his illegal drug use, with an objective \ndirected at abstinence from illegal marijuana use. The record contains no signed \nstatement of intent by Applicant that any future drug involvement will constitute grounds \nfor revocation of national security eligibility. AG \u00b6 26 is inapplicable.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nI \nhave \nexamined \nthe \nevidence \nunder \nthe \nguideline \nfor \ndrug \ninvolvement/substance misuse in the context of the nine general factors of the whole-\nperson concept listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \naccess to classified information must be an overall common-sense judgment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n \n\n \n  8 \n \nApplicant is 47 years old. He has been purchasing and using marijuana since \nJune 2017 because state law authorizes its use. State law controlling marijuana \npurchases and use within the state does not eclipse the authority of the Federal \ngovernment to control the use of illegal drugs and controlled substances by those \nemployed on Government projects. Hence, by working through a private defense \ncontractor on a United States (U.S.) Department of Defense task for the Federal \ngovernment, an applicant must abide by Federal law. Applicant\u2019s position that the \nprocedure necessary to obtain a security clearance is to stop when he gets his security \nclearance is wrong. Instead, Applicant should show that he has made constructive \nchanges in his lifestyle that cultivates a drug free environment. For example, Applicant \ncould have provided evidence that he discovered alternative treatment regimens for his \nchronic pain. A medical marijuana card confers no unique significance under the \nadjudicative guidelines or supplemental regulatory policies. See ISCR Case No. 20-\n02974 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 1, 2022) Considering the entire record under the whole \nperson, Applicant\u2019s evidence in mitigation does not overcome the drug involvement \nguideline.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s reliance on Public Law 117-215 is misplaced. The regulation \naddresses medical marijuana research and is not relevant to security clearance holders. \nA medical marijuana card does not excuse a security clearance applicant from the \nDepartment of Defense (DOD) around-the-clock prohibition against use of illegal drugs \nwhile working on Federal government projects.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \n \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-c: \n \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security interest of the United States to grant \nApplicant eligibility for access to classified information or hold a sensitive position. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n \n \n \n___________ \nPaul J.

On \nApril 20, 2023, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency Consolidated \nAdjudication Services (DCSA CAS) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging \nsecurity concerns under Guideline F.

Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan at 531. \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.

Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan at 531.  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nAt the hearing, Applicant claimed that the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.l was a duplicate \nof the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e. When the same conduct is alleged twice in the SOR \nunder the same guideline, one of the duplicative allegations should be resolved in \nApplicant\u2019s favor. See ISCR Case No. 03-04704 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2005) (same \ndebt alleged twice). Applicant\u2019s claim is supported by the evidence. Accordingly, I have \nresolved SOR \u00b6 1.l in his favor. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence submitted at the hearing establish the \nfollowing disqualifying conditions under this guideline:  \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; and \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \nAG \u00b6 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are recent, numerous, \nand were not incurred under circumstances making recurrence unlikely. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not fully established. Applicant voluntarily fathered each of his \nchildren, but his legal battles to retain custody of his 11-year-old child and to litigate the \namounts of child support payments were conditions largely beyond his control. He \nsubmitted no evidence of any other conditions largely beyond his control. At the hearing, \nhe claimed that he paid several debts and tried to settle several debts, but he provided \nno documentation showing reasonable efforts to resolve his debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is not established. Applicant submitted no evidence of financial \ncounseling. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is not established. Although Applicant claimed that he paid the debts \nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.e, 1.g, and 1.h, he submitted no documentary evidence \nsupporting his claims. He claimed that he made reasonable efforts to settle the debts \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.k but was unsuccessful.

Applicant provided no documentary evidence of a \nbasis for disputing any of the debts alleged in the SOR. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline F and evaluating all the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by \nhis delinquent debts. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.i: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.j:  \n \nWithdrawn \nSubparagraphs 1.k:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.l:  \n \nFor Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

His admissions are incorporated into the \nfindings of fact. Based on my review of the pleadings, evidence submitted, and testimony, \nI make the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is 48 years old. He graduated high school in 1995. He was married in \n1996 and divorced in 2018. He has three adult children. Since 2019, he has worked as a \nsafety manager for a defense contractor. He served on active duty in the Marine Corps \nfrom 1995 to his retirement in 2018. During his service, he deployed to Afghanistan once \nand Iraq three times. (Tr. 16-20; GE 1) \nUnder Guideline J, the SOR alleges in 2022, Applicant was arrested in State A and \ncharged with two counts of felony aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. A few \nmonths later, he entered a pre-trial intervention agreement. He underwent an anger \nmanagement and psychiatric evaluation. He had check-ins with a probation officer until \nmid-2023. \nApplicant was returning home from a shopping trip in a populated tourist area near \nhis home. He was driving a large pickup truck in two lanes of traffic heading over a long \nbridge. He was in the left lane, behind a driver that started driving erratically. He was \nunable to go around the erratic driver because the right lane was congested with traffic. \n(Tr. 21-83; GE 2) \nThe driver in front \u201cbrake checked\u201d him the first time without slowing down \nsignificantly. A brake check is when a driver hits their brakes, with a clear road in front of \nthem, to cause the driver behind them to take evasive action to prevent a collision. The \ndriver brake checked Applicant four more times, almost causing collisions between the \ntwo vehicles. Applicant stated he believed the driver mistook him for someone else and \nwas acting aggressively at the wrong person. (Tr. 21-83; GE 2) \nAt the end of the bridge, Applicant wanted to get in front of the erratic driver so he \nwould not have to continue to evade collision. In this popular congested area, there was \ntoo much traffic on the right to change lanes, so he drove in the gravel median on the left \nto get in front of the erratic driver. He assessed that it was critical to get in front of them \nfor safety. When Applicant entered the median, the other driver stopped slowing down \nand sped up to drive along side of him to prevent him from getting in front of their vehicle. \n(Tr. 21-83; GE 2) \nApplicant was able to go around the other vehicle, but once he did, there was a \ntraffic bottleneck directly to his front and he could drive no further. He got out of his vehicle \nfor two reasons, first, he thought if the driver mistook him for someone else, seeing that \nhe was not that person would deescalate the situation. Second, Applicant feared for his \npersonal safety. He was worried because the other driver was acting so aggressively, \nthey could get out of their car with a gun and shoot him from behind.

He stated in that situation, there \nwas no time to call police for help, and he was unable to drive away. (Tr. 21-83)  \nAfter Applicant exited his vehicle, he yelled at the other driver \u201cwhat are you doing.\u201d \nAt this moment his sandal broke, and when he reached down to fix it the other driver \ndelivered a barrage of punches to his head. He did not hit the other driver back. He was \nknocked down by the attack and his vision became cloudy. He could only see blurry \nfigures, but heard the other driver tell his passenger that he was going to \u201ckill that Mother \nF#&%@r\u201d. (Tr. 21-83) \nAfter Applicant heard that declaration, he feared for his life. He stumbled back to \nhis vehicle and obtained his pistol. He possessed a valid concealed carry permit for his \npistol from State B, which has permit reciprocity with State A. He brandished his pistol, \nholding it at the low ready position \u2013 out front and pointed downwards at a 45-degree \nangle, he warned the other driver to leave. His vision was still clouded at this point. He \ncould see blurry figures backing away and heard them leave. (Tr. 21-83; GE 2; AE B) \nSome drivers in the area saw parts of the incident and called police. Police \nobtained a few brief statements from some of these persons. Most of these statements \nreport small snippets of the entire interaction. Some contradict reporting from both \nApplicant and the other driver (AKA the \u201cvictim\u201d) in the incident and do not make sense. \nOne witness reported that Applicant was brake checking the other driver. (Tr. 21-83; GE \n3) \nWhen police arrived, Applicant was not asked his version of events, and did not \nhave the chance to assert that he was acting in self-defense. Police only asked him if \nApplicant hit the other driver and if Applicant drew his pistol from his truck. He was \narrested without any further questioning. His mug shot and post arrest photos showed his \ninjuries from the other driver\u2019s assault, and his injuries are mentioned in the police report. \n(Tr. 21-83; GE 2, 3) \nAfter his arrest, Applicant found out that the other driver was a habitual felony \noffender and had three dozen arrests, including offenses involving firearms, drugs, \naggravated battery with a deadly weapon, domestic battery, burglary, and assault. The \npassenger was his girlfriend who also had multiple arrests. Their arrest history was \nsubmitted into the record. Since their car had tinted windows, he later learned that they \nhad children in their vehicle while driving erratically, trying to cause multiple collisions, \nand attacking him. (Tr. 21-83; Answer) \nApplicant has no criminal record. He testified that he took the pretrial agreement \nover going to trial to prove self-defense, because of the financial burden the litigation \nwould have caused. He had to take a loan from his 401K to pay his attorney fees to get \nto the pretrial diversion agreement offer. His attorney told him it would cost tens of \nthousands of dollars more to take his case to trial. The pretrial agreement was ten months \nof probation, fees, and a psychological and anger management evaluation. Applicant was \ncleared in both evaluations.

He went to see her four times, and then was told just \nto call her to do his check-in. His probation was terminated early. (Tr. 21-83; AE A-E) \nApplicant no longer has his pistol. He stated that his experience in self-defense \nwith the State A justice system was so negative and costly, he will never carry it again. \n(Tr. 21-83)   \nApplicant\u2019s employer retained him after the incident and has since promoted him. \nHe provided six character letters, which state he is a valuable employee, reliable, \ntrustworthy, has good character, and should be granted a security clearance. He also \nsubmitted his DD 214 showing an excellent record of military service, and four \nperformance evaluations from his current employer, which show effective and exceptional \nperformance. (AE G-R) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct  \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern for criminal conduct: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 31. \nThe following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nThe criminal conduct security concerns are established by the police and court \nrecords and Applicant\u2019s admissions. AG \u00b6 31 (b) applies. \nI have considered the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 32. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and  \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited to, \nthe passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, good employment record, or constructive community involvement. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 32(a) applies. Applicant was arrested almost three years ago. It occurred \nunder unusual circumstances which are unlikely to recur. It does not cast doubt on his \nreliability, trustworthiness, or judgement. \nApplicant\u2019s decision to get out of his vehicle, so that he would not get shot from \nbehind, was sensible and consistent with logical self-defense principles. Given his \ninteraction on the road with the other driver, it was reasonable for Applicant to believe the \ndriver wanted to cause him harm. Applicant was legally carrying his firearm. Despite being \nphysically attacked, Applicant used the proper amount of force, brandishing his pistol to \nprevent further assault. The evidence that the other driver was a habitual felony offender \ngives further credibility to Applicant\u2019s version of events and actions that day. \nAG \u00b6 32(d) applies. The incident that led to Applicant\u2019s arrest occurred almost three \nyears ago. He had no criminal record before the event, and there is no recurrence of \ncriminal activity. He complied with the terms of probation and completed it successfully. \nHe has a documented good employment record and an honorable record of military \nservice. He no longer carries or owns his pistol. There is no other conduct of concern. \nThere is ample evidence to find there has been successful rehabilitation. The criminal \nconduct security concerns are mitigated. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 details the personal conduct security concern: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes\u2026 \nSOR \u00b6 2.a cross-alleges the Guideline J allegation (\u00b6 1.a) under Guideline E. \nDepartment Counsel argued that \u00b6 16(c) applies (Tr. 89). Disqualifying condition \u00b6 16(c) \nstates: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information. \nUnder AG \u00b6 17, the following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \nI found for Applicant under Guideline J and the same reasoning applies to \nGuideline E. AG \u00b6 17(c) applies. Applicant was arrested almost three years ago. It \noccurred under unusual circumstances which are unlikely to recur. It does not cast doubt \non his reliability, trustworthiness, or judgement. \nApplicant was legally carrying his firearm. He did not create the situation that led \nto the conflict. His decision to get out of his vehicle was sensible, and consistent with \nlogical self-defense principles. Despite being physically attacked, Applicant used the \nproper amount of force, brandishing his pistol to prevent further assault. The personal \nconduct security concerns are mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I considered his military service, performance in his current \nemployment, and six character letters. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines J and E in my whole-person analysis. \nI had the chance to observe Applicant\u2019s demeanor and asses his credibility. He \nadequately explained the circumstances surrounding the SOR allegations, and I found \nhis testimony and explanations to be credible and substantially corroborated by \ndocumentary evidence. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. He provided sufficient evidence to mitigate \nthe criminal conduct and personal conduct security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a:   \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a:   \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security \nclearance.

Or.) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960); DoD \nDirective 5220.6 Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program, \n(January 2, 1992) (Directive); and Security Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing in \nAppendix A the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for \nAccess to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), \neffective June 8, 2017. \n1 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on August 16, 2023, and requested a hearing. \nThe case was assigned to me on April 17, 2024.

Applicant relied on one \nwitness (himself) and no exhibits. The transcript (Tr.) was received on June 25, 2024. \nProcedural Issues \nPrior to the opening of the hearing, Department Counsel moved to amend SOR \u00b6 \n2.d to read as follows: \u201cIn about March 2005, you were discharged from the Army for a \npattern of misconduct (implicitly inclusive of fighting with a non-commissioned officer \n(NCO)). Department Counsel\u2019s amendment motion was granted without objection. (Tr. \n15) \nBefore the close of the hearing, Applicant requested the record be kept open to \npermit him the opportunity to supplement the record with documentation of his federal \nand state tax filings for tax years 2015-2016 and 2020 and his current residence state \nchild support account summary and state transfer timelines. (Tr. 129) For good cause \nshown, Applicant was granted seven calendar days to supplement the record. \nDepartment Counsel was afforded seven days to respond. Within the time permitted, \nApplicant documented his filed federal 2022 federal tax return. Applicant\u2019s post-hearing \nexhibit was admitted without objection as Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A (AE A). \nSummary of Pleadings \nUnder Guideline F, Applicant allegedly (a) failed to file his federal and state \nincome tax returns, as required, for tax years 2015-2016 and 2018-2020; (b) is indebted \nfor child support arrears of $39,806; and (c) accumulated four delinquent debts \nexceeding $33,000. Allegedly, these federal and state tax filings, child support arrears, \nand delinquent debts remain unresolved and outstanding. \nUnder Guideline, E, Applicant allegedly falsified his electronic questionnaires for \ninvestigations processing (e-QIP) of March 2018 by omitting his failure to file his federal \nand state tax returns for the years in issue; (b) was fired from his employment with \nCompany A for sexually harassing co-workers; (c) was discharged from the Army for \ncited misconduct (i.e., fighting with a a non-commissioned officer (NCO)) later amended \nto read pattern misconduct; and (d) was apprehended by military police in December \n2004 for committing an assault consummated by battery against his spouse, who was \npregnant (probable cause opined by a judge advocate officer that he committed the \noffense Finally, the SOR cross-alleged the allegations covered by SOR Guidelines F \nand J. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.1.b, 1.d, 1.f, and 1.g) \nUnder Guideline J, Applicant allegedly was arrested and charged with multiple \ncriminal offenses (four in all) between 2011 and 2015.

Applicant denied most \nof the allegations covered  by Guideline J, admitting only the allegations covered by \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.b and 3.d. \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 41-year-old employee of a defense contractor who seeks a security \nclearance. Allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by Applicant are incorporated \nand adopted as relevant and material findings. Additional findings follow. \nBackground \nApplicant married in September 2002 and divorced in 2004. (GEs -2; Tr. 36) He \nhas two children (ages 19 and 21) from this marriage. Since 2021, he has cohabited \nwith his girlfriend. (GE 1) He reported taking on-line college classes from September \n2021 through October 2021 without earning a degree or diploma. (GE 3) He enlisted in \nthe Army in June 2001 and served four years of active duty before receiving a general \ndischarge in March 2005 for cited misconduct (fighting with a non-commissioned \nofficer). (GEs 1-4 and 16-17; Tr. 63-70) \nSince February 2022, Applicant has been employed by his current employer as \nan engineering technician. (Tr. 34)  Previously, he worked for other employers. (GEs 1-\n4) Between September 2019 and April 2021, he was employed as a behavioral health \nspecialist before he was terminated for a cited violation of company policy (i.e., sexual \nharassment of coworkers). (GEs 1 and 3-5; Tr. 45)  \nApplicant reported multiple periods of involuntary terminations (nine in all, \ninclusive of his April 2021 termination), unemployment, and layoffs between May 2008 \nand April 2021 for assorted reasons. (GEs 1-5; Tr.43-46, 56-59) Asked about sexually-\nrelated comments he made to coworkers in past places of employment, Applicant freely \nacknowledged making sexually tinged jokes to coworkers that could have been \ninterpreted to be offensive. (Tr. 46-52) \nApplicant\u2019s Finances  \nRecords document that Applicant did not file his federal and state income tax \nreturns (timely or otherwise), as required, for tax years 2015-2016 and 2018-2020 (GEs \n1-4; Tr. 119) Explanations offered by Applicant for his tax-filing lapses were several: \nlack of funds, receipt of a letter from the U.S. Treasury Department in 2016 or 2017 \ninforming him of his loss of passport privileges and loss of refunds pending his \nsatisfaction of his child support arrears, and contemporaneous assurances he received \nfrom his tax preparer that the IRS would be filing his federal and state tax returns for the \nyears in issue. (GE 3; Tr.115-116, 129-130) \n3 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nStill, Applicant acknowledged his being made aware by his tax preparer and the \nIRS as early as 2021 that he was behind in the filing of his federal and state tax returns \nfor tax years 2015-2016 and 2018-2020. (GE 3; Tr. 119-122) Even when armed with \nthis confirmed information from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), he failed to take \nany affirmative steps to file his federal and state tax returns for the years in issue. \nDocumentation is lacking for each of the explanations Applicant offered \nconcerning his tax-filing lapses for the years in issue, and his overall credibility is \ninsufficiently established to permit the acceptance of any of his explanations on the \nbasis of his verbal assurances alone. Based on the evidence developed in the record, \ninferences warrant that Applicant failed to file his 2015-2016 and 2018-2020 federal and \nstate tax returns, either timely or otherwise. \nBetween 2015 and 2021, Applicant accumulated child support arrears exceeding \n$67,000. (GEs 3-4 and 12-15; Tr. 145-149) Records to date document no initiated \nefforts on Applicant\u2019s part to address his child support arrears. \nOwed child support arrears are attributable to Applicant in two states. One is the \nsubject of a child support enforcement action filed in his current state (State A) of \nresidence (covered by SOR \u00b6 1.d for $39,806), and the other involves an enforcement \naction filed by a state child support enforcement agency in his ex-wife\u2019s former state \n(State B) of residence (covered by SOR \u00b6 1.f for $26,906). (GEs 3, 12, and 15; Tr. 149-\n157) Credit reports confirm the following chronology of child support arrears transfers: \nInitially from State B to State C (SOR \u00b6 1.f), which closed out its enforcement action and \ntransferred its case to Applicant\u2019s current state of residence (State A). (GEs 3, 12, and \n15; Tr. 153-159)  \nAlthough there is no timeline in the record to track these child support \nenforcement actions, from all of the evidence produced in the record, the best \ninferences to draw from the cumulative evidence produced is that Applicant\u2019s previous \nchild arrears balance in State C was consolidated in the pending enforcement action in \nState A to produce the listed $39,806 arrears balance owing (covered by SOR \u00b6 1.d). \nAdoption of this inference absolves Applicant of any child arrears owing under SOR \u00b6 \n1.f. \nBesides his accrued child support arrears, Applicant accumulated three \nconsumer debts (covered by SOR \u00b6\u00b61.c, 1.e, and 1.g), exceeding $6,000 with accrued \ninterest. (GEs 7, and 12-15; Tr. 97-98, 105-106, 145-149) None of these delinquent \naccounts have been paid or seriously addressed by Applicant to date. While he \nreportedly agreed to a monthly payment arrangement with the court on the fine imposed \non a traffic citation issued in September 2005, he defaulted on his arrangement arid \nremains indebted on the imposed $800 fine that now exceeds $1,169 with accruing \ninterest. (GE 7; Tr. 103-106) \nWhile Applicant could have likely benefitted from tax counseling and debt relief \nassistance, he has opted for neither to help him with his past tax filing, child support \narrears, and other financial issues. To date, he has declined seeking financial \n4 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nassistance. To his credit, he acknowledged his painful memories of his many judgment \nlapses in the management of his finances and offered hope for the future with his \ngaining custody of his two children. (Tr. 170-171) He provided no concrete plans or \npathways forward, however, to improve and stabilize his financial situation. At this time, \nhis finances cannot be defined as either stable or in a state of improvement. \nApplicant\u2019s History of Criminal Offenses \nBetween September 2005 and February 2015, Applicant was involved in multiple \ncriminal offenses (some traffic-related). As a young adult, he was arrested in September \n2005 and charged with driving on a suspended license, providing no proof of insurance, \nand speeding. (GEs 6-7) In court, he pled gullty to the charges and was fined $800. (GE \n7; Tr. 97-98, 103-104, and 113) \nCourt records document that in June 2011, Applicant was arrested and charged \nwith littering. (GEs 3 and 11; Tr. 94-99) He admitted the charges without offering any \nexplanations of the court\u2019s disposition. (Tr. 95) \nIn \nJune \n2013, \nApplicant \nwas \narrested \nand \ncharged \nwith \ndomestic \nviolence/assault and domestic violence/criminal damage. (GE 10; Tr. 88-94) His arrest \nand ensuing charges were triggered by verbal and physical abuses he exchanged with \nhis two female housemates (sisters). (GE 10; Tr. 88-94) .Court records document the \ndismissal of the charges in July 2013 without any assigned reasons. (GE 6) Based on \nApplicant\u2019s version of the exchange with his housemates and the court\u2019s subsequent \ndismissal of the charges without comment, this incident is resolved favorably to \nApplicant. \nApplicant was involved in another traffic-related incident in December 2013 and \nwas charged with driving on a suspended license. (GE 9) Court records document that \nthe charges were court-dismissed in March 2014. (GE 6) These charges are resolved \nfavorably to Applicant. \nIn a more recent arrest, Applicant was and charged in February 2015 with \ndisorderly conduct (fighting). (GE 8) Tr. 77-78) This police report covering the fighting \nincident recites the respective versions of Applicant and the woman who claimed \nApplicant bumped into her and later pushed her. (GE 8). Applicant denied any \nintentional pushing of the woman, and there are mixed accounts in the police report of \nthe exchange. Court records confirm that the case was dismissed in March 2015 \nwithout comment. (GE 6) Applicant\u2019s account of the exchange with the female bar \npatron was never challenged in court prior to the court\u2019s dismissal of the charges. \nWithout more evidence to reconcile the competing versions of the bar incident, these \ncharges covered by SOR \u00b6 3.a are resolved favorably to Applicant. \nApplicant\u2019s e-QIP Omissions \nAsked to complete e-QIPs in March 2018 and October 2021, Applicant omitted \nhis failures to file his federal and state tax returns, as required, for tax years 2015-2016 \n5 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nand 2018-2020. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 138-139)) Aware that he had not filed either his federal or \nstate tax returns for the years in issue, he attributed his omissions in both cases to \nmistaken misunderstandings over whether he could reasonably defer acknowledging his \ntax-filing failures to prospective future interviews with Government investigators. (Tr. \n139-140) Applicant\u2019s claimed misunderstandings are neither plausible nor credible. \nNothing in the e-QIPS he was asked to complete afforded him the right to withhold \nmaterial information. \nThe e-QIPs Applicant completed were clear in their wording and required full and \ncomplete answers to the questions posed. Applicant\u2019s omissions were both relevant and \nmaterial to a DoD investigation of his eligibility to hold a security clearance and required \nfull and truthful answers to the questions posed in section 26 of the e-QIPs about the \nfiling of his federal ad state tax returns, as required by law. Applicant\u2019s omissions, \nconsidering all of the surrounding circumstances, warrant drawn inferences of knowing \nand willful withholding of information material to his background investigation. \nWhen interviewed by an investigator from the Office of Personnel Management \n(OPM) in July 2023 (nearly two years later), Applicant voluntarily acknowledged only his \nfailure to file his federal and state tax returns for tax years 2019-2020. (GE 3) Aware of \nhis collective failures to file federal and state tax returns for tax years 2015-2016 and \n2018-2020 (at least since 2021), he withheld information covering his tax-filing failures \nfor tax years 2015-2016 from the interviewing OPM investigator (GE 3; Tr. 175-176) \nCharacterizing Applicant\u2019s answers as discrepant, the investigator did not press him for \nany clarification of his answers. (GE 3) Providing neither timely nor complete corrections \nto his e-QIP omissions of his tax-filing lapses, Applicant\u2019s OPM responses cannot be \nconsidered either prompt or good-faith disclosures. \n   Policies \nBy virtue of the jurisprudential principles recognized by the U.S. Supreme Court \nin Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988), \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a \nsecurity clearance.\u201d As Commander in Chief, \u201cthe President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. \nEligibility for access to classified information may only be granted \u201cupon a finding that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n6 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe AGs list guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision-making \nprocess covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that could \ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as \nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information.  \nThese guidelines include conditions that could raise a security concern and may \nbe disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of the conditions that could \nmitigate security concerns, if any. These guidelines must be considered before deciding \nwhether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued, or denied. Although, \nthe guidelines do not require judges to place exclusive reliance on the enumerated \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a decision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context \nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \n  Financial Considerations \nThe Concern:  Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts \nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules or regulations, all of which \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can \nalso be caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of \nother issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, \nmental health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or \ndependence.

AG \u00b6 30. \n  Burdens of Proof \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be \na determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nSee also Exec. Or. 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), \u00a7 3.1. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

His multiple tax-filing \nlapses combined with his accumulation of child support arrears, delinquent consumer \ndebts, and an unpaid fine raise trust, reliability, and judgment concerns about his \ncurrent and future ability to manage his finances safely and responsibly. Additional \nsecurity concerns are raised over Applicant\u2019s e-QIP omissions, Army general discharge \nand involuntary terminations, and assorted criminal arrests and charges (some traffic-\nrelated and others involving disorderly conduct and domestic assault). \nFinancia Concerns \nApplicant\u2019s multiple federal and state tax-filing lapses and accumulation of child \narrears delinquent consumer debts, and unpaid fines warrant the application of three of \nthe disqualifying conditions (DC) of the financial consideration guideline. DC \u00b6\u00b6`19(a), \n\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d; 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d; and \n19(f), \u201cfailure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax \nreturns, or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required.\u201d Each of \nthese DCs bear relevance and materiality to Applicant\u2019s situation. \nFinancial stability in a person cleared to protect classified information is required \nprecisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of a security clearance that \nentitles the person to access classified information. While the principal concern of a \nsecurity clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated difficulties is vulnerability to coercion and \ninfluence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in cases involving delinquent debts. \nHistorically, the timing of addressing and resolving tax-filing and payment failures \nare critical to an assessment of an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, reliability, and good \njudgment in following rules and guidelines necessary for those seeking access to \nclassified information or to holding a sensitive position. See ISCR Case No. 14-06808 at \n3 (App. Bd. Nov. 23. 2016); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015); \nISCR Case No. 14-00221 at 2-5 (App. Bd.

For all of these tax years, Applicant had imputed \nawareness of his required filing of his tax returns for these tax years and was made \nexpressly aware of his tax-filing obligations at least by 2021. Child support arrears \naccrued by applicant in State A remain unresolved and outstanding. And, Applicant has \nyet to make any progress in addressing and resolving his accumulated delinquent debts \nand unpaid fine imposed by a court of State A in 2005. \nWithout any evidence of approved extensions of times for Applicant\u2019s filing his \nfederal and state tax returns, none of the potentially available mitigating conditions are \navailable to him.

Based on Applicant\u2019s track \nrecord to date, none of the potentially available mitigating conditions are \navailable to him under Guideline E. \nCriminal Conduct Concerns \nSecurity concerns are also raised under Guideline J. These concerns cover \nmultiple arrests and charges over offenses arising between September 2005 and \nFebruary 2015. One applicable DC covered by Guideline J is DC \u00b6\u00b6 31(b), \u201cevidence \n(including, but not limited to a credible allegation, an admission, and matters of official \nrecord) of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the individual was formally charged, \nprosecuted, or convicted.\u201d Of the covered Guideline J allegations, two are \nunsubstantiated (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a and 3.c). The remaining three allegations covered by SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 3.b, 3.d, and 3.e, while substantiated, are mitigated by the passage of time. MCs \u00b6\u00b6 \n32(a), \u201cso much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened \nunder such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on \nthe individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\u201d; and 32(c), \u201cno reliable \nevidence to support that the individual committed the offense\u201d apply to Applicant\u2019s \nsituation. \nWhole-person Assessment \nWhole-person \nassessment \nof \nApplicant\u2019s \nclearance \neligibility \nrequires \nconsideration of whether his history of multiple tax-filing lapses, accrual of child support \narrears, and accumulation of delinquent consumer debts and unpaid fines are fully \ncompatible with minimum standards for holding a security clearance. With so little \ndemonstration of overall credibility, accountability, and responsibility, Applicant\u2019s efforts \nin establishing his clearance eligibility are not enough to overcome his repeated failures \nor inability to address his tax-filing failures, debts, and court-imposed fines over the \ncourse of many years. \nCompounding Applicant\u2019s problems in establishing the requisite trust, reliability, \nand judgment for holding a security clearance are his unmitigated e-QIP omissions and \ngeneral military discharge and involuntary civilian terminations. None of these raised \nconcerns have been mitigated or otherwise favorably resolved. \nOverall trustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment have not been established. \nBased on consideration of all the facts and circumstances considered in this case, it is \ntoo soon to make safe predictions that Applicant will be able to undertake reasoned, \ngood-faith efforts to mitigate the Government\u2019s financial and personal conduct concerns \nwithin the foreseeable future.

Eligibility for access to classified information \nis denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn June 6, 2023, the Department of Defense (DoD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guidelines E and F. \nApplicant submitted an undated response to the SOR and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on October 4, 2023. The hearing \nwas originally scheduled for October 19, 2023, but it was rescheduled at the \nGovernment\u2019s request to November 7, 2023. The hearing convened as rescheduled. \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1 through 11 were admitted in evidence without \nobjection. Applicant testified and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through D, which \nwere admitted without objection. The record was held open for Applicant to submit \nadditional documentary evidence. He submitted documents that I have marked AE E \n1 \n\n \n(bankruptcy documents) and F (child support documents) and admitted without \nobjection. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 47-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for \nhis current employer since August 2022. He served in the National Guard from 1994 to \n1995 and on active duty in the U.S. military from 1995 until he was honorably \ndischarged in 2001. He is a high school graduate. He married in 1995 and divorced in \n2005. He lived with a cohabitant from about 2012 or 2013 to 2019. He currently lives \nwith a different cohabitant. He has seven children. He also tragically lost a child at birth. \n(Transcript (Tr.) at 31, 58, 133-136, 151-153; GE 1, 3, 7) \nApplicant was an E-5 and stationed overseas in May 2000. Military police were \nnotified that at about 0215, Applicant and a first lieutenant from his company violated a \npolicy when they purchased food from a vendor after 0200. They were warned not to \npurchase food, but they refused to leave until they purchased the food. They were \nescorted to the military police station. The report indicated that the first lieutenant \u201cwas \nextremely belligerent and used indecent language towards the military police.\u201d The \nreport indicated there was sufficient probable cause to charge Applicant and the first \nlieutenant with failure to obey an order or regulation, drunk and disorderly conduct, \nconduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman, and indecent language. It appears that \nmost of the alleged charges referred to the first lieutenant and not Applicant because as \nan enlisted person, Applicant could not be charged with conduct unbecoming an officer, \nand the report did not state that Applicant was belligerent or used indecent language. \n(GE 5) \nApplicant stated that he recognized a first lieutenant from his unit fighting with \nanother individual. He tried to break up the fight and get the lieutenant to leave. At that \npoint, the military police arrived, and the lieutenant started arguing with the military \npolice. Applicant stated that he tried to take the lieutenant back to base, but the MPs \narrested him for drunk and disorderly and failure to obey an order. (Tr. at 18-19, 85-87; \nApplicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 3, 5) \nApplicant stated in an October 2022 background interview that he received \nnonjudicial punishment under Article 15 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) \nfor the incident. He did not recall what he was charged with nor what punishment was \nawarded. In his response to the SOR and during his testimony, he stated that he \nrefused nonjudicial punishment and requested a court-martial. He stated that his \ncommand convinced him to perform extra duties without formally going through \nnonjudicial punishment. (Tr. at 18-21, 86-87, 134-135; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE \n3) \nApplicant was stopped by the police in October 2005 for speeding. The police \nreport indicated that Applicant\u2019s speech was slurred and there was a strong odor of \nalcohol. He was belligerent and uncooperative. He cursed at the police officers and \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \nrefused to take a breath or blood test. He was arrested and charged with driving while \nintoxicated (DWI). (Tr. at 87; GE 4, 6) \nApplicant stated that he wanted a breath or blood test, but the police did not give \nhim one. He stated that the video camera and breathalyzer were not working. He denied \nthat he was belligerent with the police officers. He received some type of diversion \nprogram in which he had to report to the probation office, attend an alcohol class, and \npay fines and fees. The charge was dismissed in 2006 after he successfully completed \nthe diversion program. (Tr. at 88-92; GE 3) \nApplicant was arrested again for DWI in about 2007. He testified that he received \na deferred adjudication in which he completed a class, and the charge was then \ndismissed. (Tr. at 88-92, 128-129) There is no independent evidence of the 2007 DWI, \nand it was not alleged in the SOR. Any matter that was not alleged in the SOR cannot \nbe used for disqualification purposes. It may be used to assess Applicant\u2019s credibility, in \nthe application of mitigating conditions, and in the whole-person analysis. \nApplicant submitted a Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions (SF 85P) in May \n2011. He answered \u201cNo\u201d to a police record question that asked, \u201cIn the last 7 years, \nhave you been arrested for, charged with, or convicted of any offense(s)? (Leave out \ntraffic fines of less than $150.)\u201d He did not report that he was arrested in May 2005 and \n2007 and charged with DWI. (Tr. at 105-107; GE 2) \nApplicant also answered \u201cNo\u201d to a question on the 2011 SF 85P that asked, \u201cAre \nyou now over 180 days delinquent on any loan or financial obligation? Include loans or \nobligations funded or guaranteed by the Federal Government.\u201d He failed to list any of \nthe delinquent debts that were listed on an August 2011 credit report, including an \n$8,211 charged-off auto loan. (Tr. at 114; GE 2) \nApplicant denied intentionally providing false information on the SF 85P. He \nstated that he misunderstood the police record question to be asking if he had been \nconvicted. He also stated that he thought his DWI charges were more than seven years \nold. He testified that he was unaware that he had delinquent debts. (Tr. at 107-118; \nApplicant\u2019s response to SOR) \nPolice responded to a bar just after midnight in February 2012. The police report \nindicates that Applicant and another man refused to leave the bar after security told \nthem to leave. They still did not leave after the police told them to leave. They finally left \nand were separated by the police. The other individual apparently resisted \napprehension. Applicant was arrested as he started to walk toward the other individual \nand the police officer. He was charged with criminal trespassing and public intoxication. \nThe owner of the bar did not want to pursue criminal charges, and the charges were \ndismissed in April 2012. (Tr. at 92-96; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 3, 4, 7) \nApplicant was living with a cohabitant (Ms. A) in January 2014 when the police \nresponded to a domestic violence call. Ms. A reported that she and Applicant had an \nargument, and he told her that she had to leave. She responded that they both lived \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthere, and she was not leaving. She told the police that he grabbed her, spun her \naround, placed her in a \u201cchoke hold,\u201d took her to the ground, and choked her. After he \nreleased her, he again told her to leave. He choked her again when she refused. (GE 7) \nWhen the police arrived, they noticed redness on the Ms. A\u2019s neck, bruising on \nher arm, and a welt on her knee. She told the police that Applicant had also mistreated \nher in the past. Applicant was arrested and charged with the felony offense of assault \nfamily/house member impeding breath/circulation. An emergency protective order \n(EPO) was issued by a magistrate forbidding Applicant from communicating with the \ncohabitant or returning to the property. (Tr. at 96; GE 4, 7) \nAn investigator contacted Ms. A about nine days later, and she told the \ninvestigator that she did not want Applicant to be prosecuted. She admitted that she and \nApplicant had been in contact, and that he had returned to the residence. The \ninvestigator met with Applicant a few days later in February 2014. Applicant told the \ninvestigator that he placed his hands on the cohabitant, but it was after she swung at \nhim, and he was trying to restrain her to avoid being hit. He admitted that he spoke with \nMs. A over the phone, but she called him. He also admitted that he returned to the \nresidence to pick up his things. He was charged with violating the EPO. The case was \n\u201cno billed\u201d in April 2014 and all charges dismissed. (GE 7) \nApplicant stated that he and Ms. A had been drinking when they started arguing. \nHe told her to leave, and she \u201cattacked\u201d him. He grabbed her just to restrain her. He \ndenied striking and choking her. He stated that his daughter lived with him, and he \nreturned to the property because there was nowhere else for him and his daughter to \ngo, and Ms. A was staying with her mother. (Tr. at 97-105; Applicant\u2019s response to \nSOR) \nApplicant has not been arrested or charged with anything since the 2014 \ncharges. He testified that he \u201cquit drinking a long time ago,\u201d and that \u201cI don\u2019t even drink \ntoday.\u201d He then clarified that he still drinks socially in moderation, but he no longer goes \nout and parties. (Tr. at 131-132, 147, 151-153) \nApplicant submitted a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) in \nSeptember 2022. He answered \u201cNo\u201d to all the police record questions. The questions \nwere in two sections. The first section requested information from the previous seven \nyears. The second section asked: \nOther than those offenses already listed, have you EVER had the \nfollowing happen to you? \n*\n*\n* \n\u2022 Have you ever been charged with any felony offense? (Include \nthose under the Uniform Code of Military Justice and non-\nmilitary/civilian felony offenses) \n4 \n\n \n \n*\n*\n* \n\u2022 Have you ever been charged with an offense involving alcohol or\ndrugs? \n \nApplicant was interviewed for his background investigation in November 2022. \nHe provided negative answers to all the criminal questions, including whether he had \never been charged with a felony or an offense related to alcohol. The interviewer \nreminded him that they were \u201cever\u201d questions and not limited to the last seven years. He \nthen discussed his criminal history, including the matters discussed above, except he \nnever discussed the 2007 DWI. He stated that he did not think he had to report the 2005 \nDWI because he had not been convicted. He stated that he had never been charged \nwith any other offense related to alcohol or drugs. He stated he did not report the 2014 \narrest for domestic violence because he did not know he had been charged with a \nfelony. (GE 3) \nApplicant denied intentionally providing false information on the 2022 SF 86. He\nstated that he misunderstood the police record questions to be asking if he had been \n\u201cconvicted.\u201d He also stated that he thought he only had to go back seven years. He \nstated that he discussed the 2007 DWI with the background investigator, but the \ninvestigator did not include it in the report. He also stated that he filled out the SF 86 \nquickly, and he \u201cbreezed through\u201d the application. (Tr. at 25, 120-131, 135-137, 148-\n149; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 3) \n \nI did not find Applicant credible. I find the police reports associated with his \narrests to be more reliable than his testimony. I also find that he intentionally provided \nfalse information on the 2011 SF 85P and the 2022 SF 86, as discussed further in the \nanalysis section. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, including a Chapter 13 bankruptcy \ncase and delinquent debts. He filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy case in February 2023. \nUnder Schedule D, Creditors Holding Secured Claims, the petition listed an auto loan of \n$9,782. Under Schedule E/F, Creditors Who Have Unsecured Claims, the petition listed \n$4,058 owed to his bankruptcy attorney and 13 additional claims totaling $36,051. A \n$3,500 claim was for a student loan. As part of the bankruptcy, Applicant surrendered \nthree vehicles to the holders of the auto loans. From March 2023 through November \n2023, he paid $6,438 into the bankruptcy plan. He received financial counseling as a \nrequirement of the bankruptcy. (Tr. at 22-24, 45-48; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 8; \nAE E) \nThe SOR alleges the Chapter 13 bankruptcy case (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and 15 delinquent \ndebts as listed on an October 2022 credit report (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c-1.p) or an April 2023 credit \nreport (SOR \u00b6 1.b). The debts include a student loan that was $5,442 past due with a \nbalance of $10,358 (SOR \u00b6 1.b); an auto loan that was $5,777 past due with a balance \nof $52,660 (SOR \u00b6 1.o); $1,193 in child support arrearages (SOR \u00b6 1.p); and 12 \nmiscellaneous delinquent debts totaling about $23,600 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c-1.n). \n5 \n\nApplicant attributed his financial problems primarily to a job change in which he \nmade substantially less in the new job. He changed jobs because he had an extreme \ncommute for the first job, and he was moving closer to his current cohabitant. He also \noverextended himself on auto loans and helping his children. He had five vehicles with \nloans in his name, including the vehicle and loan that was $5,777 past due with a \nbalance of $52,660 (SOR \u00b6 1.o). That vehicle and a car were his vehicles. Two other \nvehicles were for his adult children, and another was for Ms. A\u2019s child. They were \nsupposed to pay the loans but had financial issues associated with the COVID-19 \npandemic and loss of employment. As part of the bankruptcy, Applicant surrendered the \nthree vehicles for the children to the holders of the auto loans. The truck with the \n$52,660 balance was voluntarily repossessed before the bankruptcy. He still has the \nfifth vehicle, which was reported under Section D of the bankruptcy petition. (Tr. at 22, \n28-37, 42-45, 55-63, 76-77, 80-84, 152; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 3, 8) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleges a student loan that was $5,442 past due with a balance of \n$10,358. Applicant stated this loan was for an online school that lost its accreditation, \nafter which the school forgave the loan. The debt is not listed on the October 2022 \ncombined credit report. The April 2023 Equifax credit report indicates the account was \nopened in July 2020, with a last payment date of March 2021. The debt is not included \nin the Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition. Both credit reports list four Department of \nEducation student loans totaling $14,750 in good standing. It is unclear why the \nbankruptcy petition only listed one student loan for $3,500. (Tr. at 48-55; Applicant\u2019s \nresponse to SOR; GE 10, 11: AE F) \nThe SOR debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c-1.n are reported as delinquent on an \nOctober 2022 credit report. They are included in the Chapter 13 bankruptcy case. He \ndiscussed the debts during his background interview in November 2022. (GE 3, 10) \nSOR \u00b6 1.p alleges $1,193 in child support arrearages. That account is listed by \nall three credit reporting agencies on the October 2022 combined credit report. It is not \nlisted on the April 2023 Equifax credit report. Applicant stated the child support \npayments are automatically deducted from his pay, but the deductions were disrupted \nwhen he changed jobs. He indicated he has caught up to the payments, and there are \nno more arrearages. (Tr. at 39-40, 78-79; AE F) \nApplicant submitted documents and letters attesting to his excellent job \nperformance and strong moral character. He is praised for his reliability, work ethic, \ndedication, and integrity. (AE A-D) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information; and \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes . . . engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the \nperson\u2019s personal, professional, or community standing. \nSOR \u00b6 2.a \nSOR \u00b6 2.a alleges that Applicant intentionally falsified the 2022 SF 86 when he \nfailed to report the January 2014 arrest for the felony offense of assault family/house \nmember impeding breath/circulation under the question that asked: \nHave you ever been charged with any felony offense? (Include those \nunder the Uniform Code of Military Justice and non-military/civilian felony \noffenses) \nApplicant denied intentionally providing false information on the 2022 SF 86. He \nstated he did not report the 2014 arrest for domestic violence because he did not know \nhe had been charged with a felony. I am not convinced by substantial evidence that \nApplicant intentionally falsified the SF 86 by failing to divulge the 2014 charges. AG \u00b6 \n16(a) is not applicable to SOR \u00b6 2.a, and that allegation is concluded for Applicant. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b, 2.c, and 2.d \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant intentionally falsified the 2022 SF 86 when he \nfailed to his 2012 arrest for criminal trespass (SOR \u00b6 2.b); his 2005 arrest for DWI (SOR \n\u00b6 2.c); and his 2000 nonjudicial punishment for failure to obey an order or regulation, \ndrunk and disorderly conduct, conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman, and \nindecent language (SOR \u00b6 2.d) under the question that asked: \u201cHave you ever been \ncharged with an offense involving alcohol or drugs?\u201d \n8 \n\n \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.b \nI am not convinced by substantial evidence that Applicant intentionally failed to \ndivulge the 2012 arrest for criminal trespass. SOR \u00b6 2.b is concluded for Applicant. \nSOR \u00b6 2.c \nSOR \u00b6 2.c is somewhat poorly drafted because it does not allege that Applicant \nfailed to report that he was charged with DWI; it alleges that he failed to report that he \nwas arrested for DWI, which was not part of the question on the SF 86. I find that \nApplicant was on notice of what he had to defend against, and the allegation is not so \ndeficient as to require me to find it for him. \nApplicant stated that he misunderstood the police record questions to be asking if \nhe had been \u201cconvicted.\u201d He also stated that he thought he only had to go back seven \nyears. He stated that he filled out the SF 86 quickly, and he \u201cbreezed through\u201d the \napplication. \nAfter assessing Applicant\u2019s credibility and considering all the evidence, including \nthe straightforward nature of the question, I find that he intentionally provided false \ninformation on the 2022 SF 86 when he failed to report that he was charged with DWI in \n2005. AG \u00b6 16(a) is applicable to SOR \u00b6 2.c. \nSOR \u00b6 2.d \nI am convinced that Applicant was arrested by the military police in 2000 for one \nor more violations of the UCMJ, but it is not clear that he was charged with an offense \ninvolving alcohol. There is no evidence that charges were preferred against him under \nthe UCMJ. AG \u00b6 16(a) is not applicable to SOR \u00b6 2.d, and that allegation is concluded \nfor Applicant. \nSOR \u00b6 2.e \nSOR \u00b6 2.e alleges that Applicant intentionally falsified the May 2011 SF 85P \nwhen he failed to report the delinquent debts that were on his August 2011 credit report. \nI am not convinced by substantial evidence that Applicant intentionally falsified this \nquestion. AG \u00b6 16(a) is not applicable to SOR \u00b6 2.e, and that allegation is concluded for \nApplicant. \nSOR \u00b6 2.f \nSOR \u00b6 2.f alleges that Applicant intentionally falsified the May 2011 SF 85P \nwhen he failed to report that he was arrested in 2005 and charged with DWI under the \nquestion that asked, \u201cIn the last 7 years, have you been arrested for, charged with, or \nconvicted of any offense(s)? (Leave out traffic fines of less than $150.)\u201d I am \nconsidering the 2007 DWI arrest and charge when assessing Applicant\u2019s credibility as \nto his explanation as to why he did not report the 2005 DWI. He denied intentionally \n9 \n\n \nproviding false information on the SF 85P. He stated that he thought the police record \nquestion only asked if he had been convicted. He also stated that he thought his DWI \ncharges were more than seven years old. \nI do not believe those explanations. The question is clear. I find that Applicant \nintentionally provided false information on the 2011 SF 85P when he failed to report that \nhe was arrested and charged with DWI in 2005. AG \u00b6 16(a) is applicable to SOR \u00b6 2.f. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.g-2.k \nApplicant\u2019s criminal conduct in 2000 (incident overseas), 2005 (DWI), 2012 \n(criminal trespass), January 2014 (assault), and February 2014 (violation of EPO) were \nalleged as personal conduct. His conduct reflects questionable judgment and an \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. It also created vulnerability to \nexploitation, manipulation, and duress. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) and 16(e) are applicable. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a \nperson with professional responsibilities for advising or instructing the \nindividual specifically concerning security processes. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability. \n10 \n\n \nApplicant was last charged with a criminal offense in February 2014, almost nine \nyears ago. That conduct would be mitigated if I believed Applicant. I do not. His conduct \ncontinues to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. The above mitigating conditions, \nindividually or collectively, are insufficient to alleviate those concerns. Additionally, \nhaving determined that Applicant intentionally provided false information in an attempt \nto mislead the government, I have also determined that his testimony about those \nstatements was also false. False statements at a security clearance hearing show a \nlack of rehabilitation, and it would be inconsistent to find his conduct mitigated.1 \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n1 See ISCR Case 03-22819 at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 20, 2006), in which the Appeal Board reversed the \nAdministrative Judge\u2019s decision to grant Applicant\u2019s security clearance: \nOnce the Administrative Judge found that Applicant deliberately falsified a security \nclearance application in September 2002, the Judge could not render a favorable security \nclearance decision without articulating a rational basis for why it would be clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant \ndespite the falsification. Here, the Judge gives reasons as to why he considers the \nfalsification mitigated under a \u201cwhole person\u201d analysis, namely that Applicant has \nmatured, has held a position of responsibility, recognizes how important it is to be candid \nin relation to matters relating to her security clearance, and has changed her behavior so \nthat there is little likelihood of recurrence. However, the Judge\u2019s conclusion runs contrary \nto the Judge\u2019s rejection of Applicant\u2019s explanations for the security clearance application \nfalsification. At the hearing (after earlier admitting the falsification in her March 2003 \nwritten statement to a security investigator), Applicant testified that she had not \nintentionally falsified her application. Given the Judge\u2019s rejection of this explanation as \nnot being credible, it follows that the Judge could not have concluded Applicant now \nrecognizes the importance of candor and has changed her behavior. \n11 \n\n \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, including multiple delinquent debts. \nThe above disqualifying conditions are applicable. \nA Chapter 13 bankruptcy case, known as a wage earner\u2019s plan, involves a debtor \nrepaying his or her debts under a plan approved and supervised by the court. It can be \na mitigating factor. The SOR alleges numerous debts that are included in the \nbankruptcy. The Chapter 13 bankruptcy case does not generate any security concerns \nbeyond the delinquent debts that are already alleged in the SOR. SOR \u00b6 1.a is \nconcluded for Applicant. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the\nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit\ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is\nbeing resolved or is under control; \n \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nApplicant appears to have a legitimate dispute with the online university holding \nthe student loan alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b. He also provided an acceptable explanation for \nthe child support arrearages alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.p. Those two debts are mitigated. \nApplicant attributed his financial problems primarily to taking a lower-paying job \nbecause he had an extreme commute for the first job, and he was moving closer to his \ncohabitant. He helped his children and the son of his cohabitant financially, and they \nhad their own financial issues associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and loss of \nemployment. He also overextended himself on auto loans. He had five auto loans in his \nname. \n12 \n\n \n \nApplicant filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy case in February 2023, after he \nsubmitted an SF 86 in September 2022 and was interviewed for his background \ninvestigation in November 2022. An applicant who begins to resolve security concerns \nonly after having been placed on notice that his or her clearance is in jeopardy may lack \nthe judgment and willingness to follow rules and regulations when his or her personal \ninterests are not threatened. ISCR Case No. 17-03229 at 6 (App. Bd. Jun. 7, 2019). \nDepending on the circumstances, a Chapter 13 bankruptcy can be sufficient to \nmitigate financial considerations security concerns. However, Applicant\u2019s Chapter 13 \nbankruptcy case still has years to run, and I cannot take him at his word that he will \ncontinue with the plan until completion. There is insufficient evidence for a determination \nthat Applicant\u2019s financial problems will be resolved within a reasonable period. I am \nunable to find that he acted responsibly under the circumstances or that he made a \ngood-faith effort to pay his debts. His financial issues are recent and ongoing. They \ncontinue to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. The \nabove mitigating conditions are not applicable. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines E and F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered \nApplicant\u2019s favorable character evidence. Most importantly, Applicant cannot be trusted \nto tell the truth. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the security concerns under Guidelines E and F. \n13 \n\n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c-1.o: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.p: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.d-2.e: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.f-2.k: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

He admitted being charged with marijuana possession in August \n2015. He admitted that he used cocaine and failed a urinalysis in May 2021 while serving \nin the U.S. Navy. He admitted that he was granted access to classified information during \nthis time. He admitted he made a poor choice when he used cocaine. He has had to face \nthe consequences of that choice and is still dealing with the consequences today. He \npushes himself everyday to learn and be the best he can be. (Item 3) \nIn response to DOHA Interrogatories, dated June 12, 2023, Applicant indicated he \nused marijuana approximately 22 times from 2015 and 2018. He describes his frequency \nof use as on a quarterly basis. His father or a family friend either gave or sold him \nmarijuana about four or five times. Applicant said he used marijuana because many \npeople he knew used marijuana and he wanted to fit in. He stopped using marijuana \nbecause he wants to be better than his father. He began to notice that his father would \noften ask him for money. He was working many hours while his father was hardly working. \n(Item 4 at 9) \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn 2021, Applicant served on a ship while he was on active duty in the U.S. Navy. \nIn May 2021, he went to a local bar on a Saturday night. He admitted to consuming four \nbeers, two shots of tequila, and two shots of whiskey over a three to four hour period. \nNeedless to say, he was intoxicated. A friend and co-worker offered him cocaine. His \nfriend told him that cocaine would help sober him up. Applicant snorted three or four lines \nin the bathroom. He did not purchase the cocaine. His friend gave it to him. It was the \nonly time he used cocaine. He had a secret clearance at the time he used cocaine. He \nwas aware the use of illegal drugs or controlled substances was prohibited while \npossessing a security clearance.  (Item 4 at 15) \nThe following Monday, he was called for a random urinalysis. His urine sample \ntested positive for cocaine.  He was called to Captain\u2019s Mast for violating Article 112a of \nthe UCMJ. He received a punishment of 60 days restriction, reduction from the paygrade \nE-4 to E-3, and was ordered to forfeit half of his pay for one month (suspended). He was \nthen discharged from the U.S. Navy with a discharge characterized as general, under \nhonorable conditions. (Item 4 at 15) \nApplicant has not used illegal drugs since this incident. He no longer associates \nwith the friend who gave him the cocaine. He does not associate with anyone who uses \nillegal drugs. He admits to drinking too much alcohol in the past. In May 2022, he reduced \nhis drinking to one to two beers about two times a month at home or at a bar.  (Item 4 at \n15) While security concerns about Applicant\u2019s alcohol consumption were not alleged in \nthe SOR, his alcohol use was a significant factor in his decision to use cocaine. I consider \nhis reduced alcohol use as a matter of extenuation and mitigation. \nApplicant has no intention of using illegal drugs in the future. He said that drugs \nhave done nothing but make his life more difficult. He lost several opportunities as a result \nof the consequences of his illegal drug use. He made a poor decision to use illegal drugs. \nHe learned from his mistakes and wants a better life for himself. (Item 4 at 2-3) \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nThe adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \n3 \n\n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse  \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern for drug involvement: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances . . . can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations.  \nI have considered the disqualifying conditions for drug involvement and substance \nmisuse under AG \u00b6 25 and the following are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 25(a) any substance misuse; \nAG \u00b6 25(b) testing positive for an illegal drug; and \nAG \u00b6 25(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including \ncultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or \npossession of drug paraphernalia.   \nThe record evidence shows Applicant has a of history of marijuana use from 2015 \nto 2018. He used marijuana at least 22 times during this time. He was charged with \npossession of marijuana in August 2015. He also used cocaine on one occasion while \nhe was on active duty in the U.S. Navy at a bar after drinking heavily. He was called for \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nurinalysis the following Monday and tested positive for cocaine. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), 25(b), and \n25(c) apply. \nThe Government\u2019s substantial evidence and Applicant\u2019s admissions raise security \nconcerns under Guideline H. The burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence to \nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. (Directive \u00b6E3.1.15) An \napplicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving \nit never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sept. 22, \n2005)) \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from drug involvement and substance misuse. The following mitigating \nconditions under AG \u00b6 26 potentially apply: \nAG \u00b6 26(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and  \nAG \u00b6 26(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence on actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: (1) Disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) \nchanging or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) \nproviding a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement \nand substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or \nmisuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility.  \nAG \u00b6 26(a) applies. Applicant\u2019s last use of illegal drugs occurred in May 2021, more \nthan three years ago. The evidence indicates he stopped marijuana use in 2018 before \nenlisting in the U.S. Navy and he used cocaine on one occasion while on active duty. \nSince his discharge from the U.S. Navy, he has found steady employment with a DOD \ncontractor and has turned his life around. \nAG \u00b6 26(b) applies. Applicant was forthcoming about his past illegal drug use. He \nno longer associates with anyone who uses illegal drugs. It is noted that his decision to \nuse cocaine occurred when he was intoxicated. Applicant has reduced his drinking \nsignificantly since 2022. While Applicant did not sign an independent formal statement of \nintent to refrain from illegal drug use, he expressed his intent to not use drugs in the future \nin his response to interrogatories. He signed the interrogatories swearing that his  \nstatements were \u201ctrue, complete, and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief and \nare made in good faith.\u201d He faced serious consequences as a result of his illegal drug use \nwhile in the U.S. Navy. He is aware of the consequences of any future illegal drug use. \nHe mitigated the concerns under Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse.  \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . .  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying condition applies: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns in this case: \n(c) the offense is so minor or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and  \n(d) the individual acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to \nchange the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, \ncircumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, unreliable, or \nother inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur.  \nBoth AG \u00b6 17(c) and AG \u00b6 17(d) apply for the same reasons the security concerns \nunder Guideline H were mitigated. While Applicant\u2019s illegal drug use in the U.S. Navy was\nserious, more than three years have passed since he used cocaine. There is no evidence\nthat he has used illegal drugs since that time. Applicant accepted responsibility for his\nbehavior. While he had not sought counseling, he has taken steps to change his behavior.\nSince his discharge from active duty, he has worked full-time for a DOD contractor since\nNovember 2021; he has reduced his alcohol use; and he has matured.  He has taken\nsteps to improve his life-style. He has demonstrated that he is reliable and trustworthy.\nThe personal conduct security concerns are mitigated. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n          \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of \nthe guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines H and E, and the AG \u00b6 2(d) factors \nin this whole-person analysis. \nApplicant\u2019s past illegal drug use raised serious security concerns. His decision to \nuse cocaine while serving on active duty in the U.S. Navy was a violation of good order \nand discipline. He suffered the consequences by punishment at Captain\u2019s Mast and being \ndischarged from the U.S. Navy. I have also considered his conduct after being discharged \nfrom active duty. He has been an employee with a DOD contractor since November 2021. \nHe has no intention of using illegal drugs in the future. His last use of illegal drugs \noccurred in May 2021, more than three years ago. I considered alcohol played a \nsignificant factor in his decision to use cocaine on the occasion. He has reduced his \ndrinking to a more responsible level. He has matured and wants more from his life. \nApplicant is aware that any future illegal drug use may result in the loss of his security \nclearance. Concerns under Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse and Personal \nConduct are mitigated. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.c: \nFor Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:   \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to \nclassified information.

After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, statements, and \nexhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 43 years old. He married in 2004 and has four minor children. He \nearned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2005 and a master\u2019s degree in 2011. He has worked for \nhis present employer, a federal contractor, since January 2018. (Item 3; AE A) \nApplicant completed a security clearance application (SCA) in May 2019. In it, he \ndisclosed he was granted a security clearance in 2013 by another agency. In March 2023, \nhe completed government interrogatories. He disclosed that he has used medical \ncannabis in edible form from March 2022 to April 2, 2023, the date before he completed \nthe interrogatory response. He stated he intended to continue using the marijuana in the \nfuture, acknowledging that it is illegal under federal law. He provided a certificate to show \nhe is permitted to use medicinal marijuana in his state, where it is legal. He provided a \nstatement that the medical marijuana is prescribed to him for a medical condition; that he \nfollows the recommended dosage; and he only uses it as prescribed for symptom relief. \nHe uses it two to four times a week, usually in the evening before going to bed. He \nprovided a document showing that he first applied for a marijuana certificate in October \n2021, and it was granted in December 2021. (Items 3, 4 5, 6) \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he stated that he uses marijuana for medical \nreasons for a diagnosed health condition, and its use was recommended by his health \ncare provider. He obtains the marijuana legally in his state from a licensed medical \ncannabis dispensary. He intends to use the marijuana until his medical condition improves \nand his doctor modifies his treatment plan. He is aware that his state\u2019s laws conflict with \nfederal law. He has tried other medications with mixed results and marijuana has a \npositive impact on his health. He stated he hoped by self-reporting his use of marijuana \nthat his trustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment would not be in question. He \nunderstood he may no longer be eligible for a security clearance but chooses to focus on \nhis personal health. (Item 2) \nIn his response to the FORM, Applicant stated his intent when self-reporting his \nmarijuana use was to be honest, transparent, and responsible because he takes his \nsecurity clearance and the obligations associated with it seriously.

In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for drug involvement and substance \nmisuse is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations.  \nAG \u00b6 25 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) any substance misuse; \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution, or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position; and \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \nApplicant began using marijuana in March 2022 and continued to use it to about \nApril 2023, acknowledging it is illegal under federal law and inconsistent with holding a \nsecurity clearance. Applicant holds a security clearance but there is insufficient evidence \nthat he has access to classified information. AG \u00b6 25(f) does not apply. He stated his \nintent is to continue using marijuana in the future for medical purposes. He is prescribed \nmedical marijuana by his health care provider and has a certificate to purchase it in his \nstate where it is legal under state law. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), 25(c) and 25(g) apply. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from drug involvement and substance misuse. The following mitigating conditions \nunder AG \u00b6 26 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions to overcome the problem, and has \nestablished a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were being used; and (3) providing \na signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \nApplicant has been using marijuana since March 2022 and intends to continue to \ndo so in the future. He understands that his use is in violation of federal law and \ninconsistent with holding a security clearance. He has made the decision that using \nmarijuana, which is prescribed by a health care professional, is helpful for his medical \ncondition. I have considered that he uses it for medical purposes, has a legal prescription \nfor it, and it is legal to purchase it in the state where he lives. However, marijuana for any \npurpose remains illegal under federal law. None of the mitigating conditions apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline H, in my whole-person analysis. \nI have a duty to exercise prudence because the protection of the national security \nis the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel \nbeing considered for national security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d I am obligated to follow that directive. Although Applicant is using marijuana \nwith a prescription for medical purposes and it may be obtained legally under state law, it \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nremains illegal under federal law. He acknowledged he understands his use is contrary \nto federal law and intends to continue to use marijuana. He failed to meet his burden of \npersuasion. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline H \nand evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant \nfailed to mitigate the security concerns under the drug involvement and substance misuse \nguideline. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nCarol G. Ricciardello \nAdministrative Judge \n6 \n",

(GE 1; Tr. 39-40, 47-49, 101-102) \nThe delinquent debts in the SOR (\u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.h), mostly consumer debts, total just \nover $23,000. They are established by credit reports, from October 2021, November \n2022, April 2023, and October 2023, (GE 4-GE 7, inclusive). Applicant also provided \nnumerous credit reports as part of her case, from April 2023 (AE E), June 2023 (AE G, \nAE H), and October 2023 (AE O). \nApplicant explained that her debts began during an abusive marriage. Both she\nand her then-husband were in the Air Force. They were living in separate states. He had \nyoung children. Their plan was that she would get a house on base and he would cover \nthe difference what the basic housing allowance would not cover. This did not happen. \nShe got a part-time job, but she stopped this work in 2018 when he retired from the Air \nForce and moved to State 1, where she was. She moved out of base housing and could \nnot afford to pay the bills that resulted. She got an off-base apartment. Her then husband \ngot a job as a contractor on base for about four to six months but was fired. Debts piled \nup, and she retained a debt relief company in about 2017-2018 but to no effect. (Tr. 26-\n27, 77-81) \n \nApplicant\u2019s ex-husband paid the mortgage for their home in State 1 but was not \nable to do so once he lost his contractor job. Ultimately, Applicant was responsible for all \nthe expenses, including feeding his children. She did not tell him they were in financial \ntrouble and was afraid to do so. She did not have access to all the family\u2019s funds and \naccounts. (Tr. 27-28, 78-84) \nIn 2019, Applicant was president of her squadron\u2019s \u201cbooster club,\u201d a social \norganization that organizes community events, activities, and fundraisers. She had \naccess to, and management responsibility for, the booster club\u2019s checking account. The \nchecking account was used to deposit donations and to fund appropriate club \nexpenditures. (GE 3 at 2; Tr. 84-86) \nIn August 2019, it came to the attention of unit leadership that a civilian club \nmember had to use her personal funds to purchase items for a booster club function \nbecause the booster club checking account was underfunded. When she was confronted \nabout the matter, Applicant admitted that she had appropriated booster club funds for \npersonal use. (GE 3 at 2; Tr. 89-90) \nApplicant explained that there had been a booster event on base. She had cash in \nhand when the event ended. She did not go to the bank. She told her chief she was going \nto deposit the money but she did not. She told her first sergeant the next day. She denied \nbeing confronted. Applicant acknowledged misappropriating funds on four occasions \nbetween April and August 2019 when her conduct was discovered. Most instances \ninvolved less than $100. Applicant used the money for gas, groceries, and other \nhousehold expenses. She did not have access to her husband\u2019s savings account that she \nwas putting money into.

(GE 2 at 4, Tr. 92-94) (SOR \u00b6 1.a) She was reduced to the grade of senior \nairman, but the reduction was suspended through mid-April 2020 when it was forgiven. \nShe forfeited $250 in pay. She was also reprimanded for willfully disregarding Article 121: \nYour actions and careless attitude have brought discredit upon both you \nand this unit. Using booster club funds for your own personal use is \nunacceptable. You have proven that you are not dependable. Any further \nincidents will be dealt with more severely. (AE S) \nAfter her reprimand, Applicant was removed as booster club president. She was \nallowed to continue with booster club activities and to handle money at events, which she \ndid later that fall but she was not allowed to make bank deposits. She completed the \nsuspension period without incident Her rank was not reduced, and she retired in June \n2021 as a staff sergeant (E-5). (Tr. 33-35, 89, 97-99; AE R) There is no indication that \nher clearance was impacted. \nApplicant testified that no one in her command lost confidence in her. She repaid \nthe money right away. This was an isolated incident. She said she made a horrible \ndecision, felt embarrassed and let a lot of people down. She deeply regrets what she did, \nfeels ashamed and guilty, and wishes she had reached out to someone such as her first \nsergeant and asked for help. (Tr. 28-32, 35-36, 96-97) \nTwo days after her actions came to light in August 2019, Applicant told her \nhusband she wanted a divorce. (Tr. 28-29, 32) He asked to keep their furniture to provide \nfor his daughters. He wanted her to pay half of the mortgage. She asked only for the \n$3,000 she had in savings, but he told her it had been spent. She bought a bed and \ndresser to use in an apartment and essentially started over from scratch. (Tr. 28-32) Their \ndivorce was finalized in March 2020. \nIn June 2021. Applicant retired from the Air Force and moved to State 2. She said \nall the SOR debts became delinquent due to her marital difficulties. She had signed up \nfor debt relief in about 2017 or 2018 but also acknowledged she neglected her debts \nbecause she could not pay them. (Tr. 28-32) \nApplicant said all of the SOR debts but for SOR \u00b6 1.b have been addressed and \npaid. She reached out to all of the creditors after her background interview in October \n2021.

She has some money in the bank, and in a 401(k) \npension. She can take care of herself. She keeps a budget. She has no late tax returns \nor tax debts.

(AE J) \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court has held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nThe adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out, \nin relevant part, in AG \u00b6 18: \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  \n(d) \u201cdeceptive or illegal financial practices such as embezzlement, \nemployee theft, . . . and other intentional financial breaches of trust.\u201d \nApplicant experienced significant financial instability in the final years of her \nsecond marriage. Her husband withheld funds from her, despite her caring for his children \nwhile they were both in the Air Force. Finding herself short of funds for household items \nin mid-2019, she misappropriated funds on about four occasions from an Air Force \nsquadron booster club of which she was the president, a position of fiduciary trust that \ncame with access to booster club funds and the club\u2019s bank account. The funds she took \nwere relatively small, but her actions came to light when the club\u2019s account ran short of \nmoney. Her actions as a booster club volunteer satisfy AG \u00b6 19(d) as an \u201cintentional \nfinancial breach of trust.\u201d In this role, she also had a \u201cfinancial obligation\u201d to act in the \nbooster club\u2019s best interest, and not her own. She did not do that, and AG \u00b6 19(c) also \napplies to her misconduct. \nApplicant repaid the money, was fined and reprimanded, and was essentially on \nprobation for six months, at which point the offense was forgiven and her reduction in \nrank was not enforced. About two years later, she was medically retired from the Air Force \nunder honorable conditions. The financial difficulties Applicant had experienced \ncontinued, however, and the SOR debts alleged are all established under AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) \nand 19(c). \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nAG \u00b6 19(e) is established for the debts at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g and 1.h, both of which \nApplicant denied and documented that they had been paid. Applicant received some \nfinancial counseling from a base family readiness center, while still in the Air Force after \nthe booster club incident. Her debts continued, however. AG \u00b6 20(c) therefore does not \nfully apply. \nApplicant experienced significant financial problems during her second marriage, \nand those problems were likely caused by her husband\u2019s abuse, financial instability, and \nunemployment. The first prong of AG \u00b6 20(b) therefore applies. For a brief period in mid-\n2019, not knowing where else to turn for help, Applicant took money from the booster \nclub to help make ends meet. While this conduct is now rather dated (more than four \nyears ago) it was nonetheless an act of poor judgment and a breach of trust. Applicant\u2019s \nfinancial problems continued. It also undercuts her reasonableness and good faith under \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and 20(d).  \nWhile Applicant has resolved many of her delinquent debts in the SOR, she began \ndoing so only after receiving the SOR. The timing of Applicant\u2019s actions undercuts a \nfinding that she has acted reasonably in addressing her debts and in full good faith. \nFurther, the fact that an applicant has delinquent debts, no matter the circumstance, is a \npotential security concern. This is because the fact of the delinquencies places an \napplicant in a position of vulnerability where they might be tempted to act in their own \ninterest rather than as a fiduciary. The problem here is that this applicant already did  that. \nWith some of applicant\u2019s delinquencies remaining unresolved, I cannot therefore find that \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthere is no risk of recurrence and that her prior actions do not cast doubt on her current \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply.  \nWhile Applicant disclosed her Article 15 proceeding and \u201csuspended bust\u201d on her \nAugust 2021 SCA, she did not disclose any ongoing delinquent debts. Nor did she \nacknowledge them until she was confronted in her background interview. Her explanation \nthat she was not keeping track of her credit is not credible, given her prior history of \nfinancial instability, which strongly suggests that she knew she had ongoing delinquencies \nfrom and after her second marriage. Further, even if it were credible, a lack of awareness \nof finances is additionally problematic. A personal conduct security concern regarding \nApplicant\u2019s answers to the general financial questions was not alleged, but her lack of \ncandor can be considered in mitigation. \nThe booster club incident is now several years old. Applicant has resolved many \nof her SOR debts. Taken independently, a security concern might be resolved here. But \nI have to address her prior conduct and her ongoing delinquencies together, and in doing \nso, I cannot find that the financial considerations security concerns are fully mitigated in \nthis case. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-\nperson analysis. I considered Applicant\u2019s honorable Air Force service and the \nrecommendations of her supervisors and work colleagues. However, Applicant did not \nprovide sufficient evidence to mitigate the security concern shown by her delinquent debts \nand prior misconduct. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts \nas to her eligibility for a security clearance at this time. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c-1.h:  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.
