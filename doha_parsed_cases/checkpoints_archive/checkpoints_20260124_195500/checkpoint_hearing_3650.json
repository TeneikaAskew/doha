Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn November 19, 2021, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline F (financial \nconsiderations). The action was taken under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) \nimplemented by DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant responded to the SOR (Answer) on November 29, 2021, and he \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge. The Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on October 14, 2022, scheduling the hearing \nfor November 7, 2022. Due to my scheduling conflict, DOHA issued an amended notice \nof hearing on October 19, 2022, rescheduling the hearing for November 17, 2022.

Applicant submitted additional documentation, which \ncollectively marked as AE H and admitted without objection. DOHA received the hearing \ntranscript (Tr.) on December 1, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.k, 1.m, and 1.n, and he denied SOR \u00b61.l. He is \n61 years old, married, and he has two adult children. He graduated from high school in \n1979, and he attended some college but did not earn a degree. He served honorably in \nthe U.S. Navy from 1982 until he retired in 1998. He has worked for various DOD \ncontractors since 1999, except for two periods of unemployment from February 2014 to \nOctober 2014 and February 2016 to April 2016. He has worked as a field engineer for his \nemployer, a DOD contractor, since April 2017. He has also worked as a part-time \novernight stocker for a retail corporation since August 2018. He was first granted a \nsecurity clearance in 1985. As of his October 2020 security clearance application (SCA), \nhe owned a home since 1999. (Answer; Tr. at 5-6, 8-9, 31-33, 66, 71-73, 85-86; GE 1-2) \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant had 13 delinquent consumer debts totaling \n$44,956. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.m) It also alleged that he failed to file, as required, his federal \nincome tax return for tax year (TY) 2019. (SOR \u00b6 1.n) The SOR allegations are \nestablished by Applicant\u2019s admissions in his Answer, his SCA, his interviews with a \nbackground investigator in January 2021 and February 2021, and three credit bureau \nreports from 2021 to 2022. (Answer; GE 1-5) \nApplicant attributed his financial difficulties, and his failure to timely file his federal \nincome tax return for TY 2019, to a loss of income from approximately October 2015 to \nFebruary 2016, when his previous employer experienced issues receiving funds from its \ncontract with the U.S. Government. As a result, his employer decreased his monthly work \nhours from 160 hours to 20 to 30 hours. His employer ultimately lost its contract, and he \nwas unemployed from February 2016 to April 2016, as noted above. Although he obtained \nanother job, his annual income decreased from $85,000 to $52,000. Simultaneously in \n2016, his spouse lost her job due to an injury, and her disability claim was rejected. He \nhas since been the sole breadwinner. (Answer; Tr. at 16-18, 68-76, 78-79, 81, 89-90; GE \n1-2; AE H) \nIn 2017, Applicant sought advice from a bankruptcy attorney, who advised him to \ncease payments on his debts and provide his creditors with the bankruptcy attorney\u2019s \ninformation. He did so, and he stopped hearing from his creditors. He ultimately elected \nto resolve his debts on his own because he could not afford the bankruptcy attorney\u2019s \nfees. In 2018, as noted above, he obtained a part-time job to supplement his income so \nthat he could address his debts. He completed his federal income tax return for TY 2019, \nbut because his financial constraints affected his ability to pay approximately $2,000 in \nfederal taxes he expected to owe for that tax year, he did not timely file that return. He \nlearned about several of his delinquent debts through the security clearance process.

(Answer; Tr. at 48-50, 52-53, 57-62, 82-85; GE 2-5; AE C, E, H) \nApplicant contacted the creditor regarding the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.l and 1.m. He \nreached a payment plan for one, and he was referred to another creditor for the other and \nthat creditor had no record of the debt. He re-contacted the creditor in November 2022 to \ninquire about SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.l and 1.m, and the creditor informed him that it could not find \neither of these accounts.

(Answer; Tr. at 55-57, 81-82, 91; GE 1-5; AE H) \nSOR \u00b6 1.n relates to Applicant\u2019s failure to timely file, as required, his federal income \ntax return for TY 2019. As noted above, he completed his federal income tax return for \nTY 2019, but because his financial constraints affected his ability to pay approximately \n$2,000 in federal taxes he expected to owe for that tax year, he did not timely file that \nreturn. He mailed his federal income tax return for TY 2019 in July 2021, and then he re-\nsent it to the IRS in December 2021 after the IRS informed him that it did not receive it. \nHe simultaneously submitted a payment request form. He timely filed his income tax \nreturns for TY 2020 and 2021. (Answer; Tr. at 17, 62-65, 86-92; GE 1-2; AE G, H) \nAlthough not alleged in the SOR, Applicant owes $1,129 for TY 2019, \napproximately $1,800 in federal taxes for TY 2020, and approximately $2,000 in state \ntaxes for TY 2020 and 2021. He received a federal refund for TY 2021, which the IRS did \nnot intercept and apply to his outstanding federal taxes for TY 2019. He contacted the \nIRS, and the IRS told him that it would accept a monthly payment arrangement of $500 \nto resolve his TY 2019 debt. He intends to enter such a payment arrangement as soon \nas he has the financial means to do so. He has been paying the state tax authority $195 \nmonthly towards his TY 2020 and 2021 taxes. (Answer; Tr. at 17, 62-65, 86-92; GE 1-2; \nAE G, H) \nApplicant earns $68,000 annually from his full-time position. He earns $300 bi\u00ad\nweekly from his part-time position. He receives $1,195 monthly in military retirement pay \nand $725 monthly in retirement pay from a previous employer. He has approximately \n$7,000 in his 401(k)-retirement savings account. He was current on his $1,305 monthly \nmortgage payment. He expected to satisfy his car loan in full in February 2022, which \nwould free up $600 that he intended to apply toward his remaining debts, to include his \noutstanding federal taxes. He does not have any other delinquent debts. He had not \nobtained credit counseling but intended to do so. His spouse manages the household \nexpenses, and they pay their bills together. She stated that he is a trustworthy and \nhonorable man. Four individuals, to include Applicant\u2019s site lead, attested to Applicant\u2019s \ntrustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of Exec. Or. \n10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall \nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also \nExec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or \nsensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . .. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax \nreturns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required. \nApplicant has a history of not being able to pay his debts. He also failed to timely \nfile his federal income tax return for TY 2019, as required. The evidence is sufficient to \nraise AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), and 19(f). \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit\ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being\nresolved or is under control;  \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConditions beyond Applicant\u2019s control contributed to Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems. The first prong of AG \u00b6 20(b) applies. For the full application of AG \u00b6 20(b), he \nmust provide evidence that he acted responsibly under his circumstances. Before he \nreceived the SOR: he consulted with a bankruptcy attorney in 2017; he obtained a part-\ntime job in 2018 to supplement his income so that he could begin resolving his debts; he \nentered a payment arrangement for SOR \u00b6 1.j in 2019 and for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.g, and 1.i in \n2020; and he paid SOR \u00b6 1.i in August 2021. He filed his federal income tax return for TY \n2019 in December 2021. He paid SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.g in February and October 2022, \nrespectively. He has a payment plan in place to address SOR \u00b6 1.c. He intends to dispute \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.l and 1.m, and he intends to pay SOR \u00b6 1.a. He also intends to pay his \noutstanding federal taxes and he makes payments in accordance with a payment plan to \naddress his outstanding state taxes, which are not alleged in the SOR. He timely filed his \nincome tax returns for TY 2020 and 2021. He expected to satisfy his car loan in full in \nFebruary 2023, which would provide him with $600 monthly that he planned to use to \ncontinue to address his remaining debts. He does not have any other delinquent debts. \nHis finances are under control, and they do not continue to cast doubt on his judgment, \ntrustworthiness, and reliability. I find that \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), 20(d), and 20(g) are \nestablished. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-\nperson analysis. Overall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as \nto Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude that Applicant \nmitigated the financial considerations security concerns. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.n:  \nFor Applicant \n Conclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nCandace Le\u2019i Garcia \nAdministrative Judge \n8 \n",

(Items 4, 5, and 6) The status of those \ndebts is as follows: \nApplicant admitted owing the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a ($25,016); 1.c ($2,494); 1.d \n($1,336); 1.e ($1,260); 1.g ($463); 1.i ($337); 1.k ($3,759); and 1.l ($13,694). They total \n$48,359. Applicant did not submit evidence to prove they are paid or being paid. \nApplicant denied owing the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b ($7,456); 1.f ($1,228); 1.h ($436); \nand 1.j ($336). He presented proof that he resolved the $7,456 debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b. (Item \nat 7). He did not provide documentation that he resolved the other three, which total $772. \nDuring a February 2021 interview, Applicant did not recognize all of the debts that \nthe government investigator asked him about but said he would pay those that are legally \nhis obligation. He said he did not have money to pay his debts because his former wife, \nWife 2, created a financial hardship for him and spent all his money. He also disclosed \nthat he was paying the Defense Finance and Accounting Services (DFAS) 15% of his \nsalary through a garnishment. He owed $13,694 for a part of the reenlistment bonus he \nreceived but was not entitled to because he left the Army before the end of the enlistment \nperiod. (Item 2 at 50, Item 3 at 5, 8, 10) \nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleged in \u00b6 1.m that in October 2018, Applicant \nreceived nonjudicial punishment (NJP) for violations of the Uniform Code of Military \nJustice (UCMJ) Article 92, for wrongfully borrowing money from two junior enlisted \nsoldiers, and Article 134, for dishonorably failing to repay another junior soldier from \nwhom he borrowed money for personal expenses. He was subsequently reduced in rank, \nforfeited pay, and received an oral reprimand. Applicant disclosed this information during \nhis February 2021 interview. (Item 1, Item 3 at 3-4) \nThe SOR alleged in \u00b6 1.n that in November 2016, Applicant received NJP for a \nviolation of the UCMJ, Article 107, for making multiple false statements that he was \nobtaining funds to help him pay his rent, and a violation of Article 134 for dishonorably \nfailing to then pay his rent. He received an oral reprimand, 45 days of extra duty, and a \nreduction in rank. At the time he made the false statements, he was in Belgium and told \nthe soldier that he would obtain the money from his wife, who was in a different country, \nto repay the money he borrowed. (Item 2, Item 3 at 3-4) \nForeign Influence \nAs noted above, I take administrative notice of the facts about the Philippines that \nwere set forth in the official U.S. Government publications that were attached to \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s request for administrative notice.

(Item 8) \nIn response to SOR \u00b6 2.a, Applicant admitted that his wife, two children, his \nstepchild, father-in-law, and mother-in-law are citizens and residents of the Philippines. \nIn his July 2020 SCA, he reported that the last time he saw his family was in January \n2020 when he visited them. He sees his in-laws whenever he visits his children. He said \nhis family does not have connections to the Philippines\u2019 government or military. (Item 2 \nat 6-7, 31-39) During his interview in February 2021, he reported that he visited his family \nin the Philippines from November 2018 to March 2019, and in September 2019 for \nfourteen days. He also traveled there in 2015 to see his former spouse, Wife 2. (Item 3 at \n7) \nDuring his February 2021 interview, Applicant stated that he and his current \nspouse, Wife 3, own a residence in the Philippines, which his wife purchased in 2019. \nThe property has a value of about US $3,000. His relatives are aware of their ownership \nof the property. (Item 3 at 6) In his Answer to SOR \u00b6 2.b, Applicant denied owning the \nproperty, but offered no explanation for his denial. \nDuring his February 2021 interview, Applicant admitted that since November 2020, \nhe had been having an affair with a woman who is a Moroccan citizen. He said that he \nhad daily contact with her since then. He was living in South Korea at the time. (Item 3 at \n7) \nIn his Answer to SOR \u00b6 2.c, which alleged that he failed to report that affair to his \nemployer, Applicant admitted that he did not report it because he was starting to divorce \nWife 3. He did not think his wife was aware of his infidelity. (Item 3 at 7) \nIn his Answer to SOR \u00b6 2.d, which alleged that Applicant had been conducting an \nextramarital affair with a foreign person since November 2020, while residing outside of \nthe United States, Applicant denied the allegation. He provided no information explaining \nthe discrepancy between his admission during his interview and his denial in his Answer. \nSexual Behavior \nIn SOR \u00b6 3.a, the Government cross-alleged under this guideline the allegations \nin SOR \u00b6 2.c and SOR \u00b6 2.d.

As noted above, Applicant admitted all allegations, \nexcept SOR \u00b6 2.d, to which he gave an answer inconsistent with a previous admission, \nand without an explanation. \nPolicies \nThe national security eligibility action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to \nHold a Sensitive Position (AG), which became effective within the DoD on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to \nclassified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nA person applying for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201c[a]ny determination \nunder this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern pertaining to financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \nas follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19 describes conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(d) deceptive or illegal financial practices such as embezzlement, employee theft, \ncheck fraud, expense account fraud, mortgage fraud, filing deceptive loan \nstatements and other intentional breaches of trust. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems. Between 2015 and 2022, he \naccumulated about $57,815 of delinquent debts, all of which he has been unable to \nresolve, except for one $7,456 debt. In addition, he received NJP in 2016 and 2018, for \nviolating UCMJ Articles 107, 134, and 92. He wrongfully borrowed money from two junior \nsoldiers and failed to repay them, and he made false statements about obtaining money \nto pay his rent and then failed to pay it. The evidence raises the above security concerns, \nthereby shifting the burden to Applicant to rebut, extenuate, or mitigate those concerns. \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate financial considerations security \nconcerns: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nThere is insufficient evidence to establish mitigation under any of the above \nmitigating conditions. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts have been ongoing since 2015 and \ncontinue to cast doubt on his reliability and judgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \nApplicant attributed his delinquent debts to his former wife, whom he said spent his money \nand created financial hardships for him. That may have been a circumstance beyond his \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n Foreign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncontrol. For the full application of AG \u00b6 20(b), Applicant must have acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances. He did not provide sufficient evidence to demonstrate that he \nattempted to responsibly manage his debts as they were accumulating. AG \u00b6 20(b) \npartially applies. \nApplicant did not provide evidence that he participated in financial counseling. He \nprovided evidence that he resolved one of the 12 alleged debts. Other than that debt, \nthere is insufficient evidence from which to conclude there are clear indications that his \ndelinquent debts are under, or coming under, control. AG \u00b6 20(c) applies to SOR \u00b6 1.b \nbut does not apply to the remaining 11 debts. He did not submit evidence that he made \nan effort to establish a plan to resolve his debts. AG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) partially applies to the debts in SOR \u00b6 1.m because the debts generated \nwhen he borrowed from subordinates have not recurred. He is no longer in the Army, and \nhe cannot borrow funds from subordinates. However, they are not fully mitigated because \nhe did not prove he paid restitution for wrongfully obtaining funds from his subordinates. \nGuideline B: Foreign Influence \nAG \u00b6 6 expresses the security concern regarding foreign influence: \nAG \u00b6 7 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual's \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology; \n(c) failure to report or fully disclose, when required, association with a \nforeign person, group, government, or country; \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship \nstatus, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n(f) substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign country, \nor in any foreign owned or foreign-operated business that could subject the \nindividual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation or personal \nconflict of interest; and \n(i) conduct, especially while traveling or residing outside the U.S., that may \nmake the individual vulnerable to exploitation, pressure, or coercion by a \nforeign person, group, government, or country. \nThe mere possession of close family ties with a person who is a citizen of, or has \nclose family members residing in a foreign country, is not, as a matter of law, disqualifying \nunder Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in a foreign country and an applicant \nhas contacts with that relative, this factor alone is sufficient to create the potential for \nforeign influence and could potentially result in the compromise of classified information. \nSee ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 \n(App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001). \nApplicant has familial connections with his wife, two children, one stepchild, and \ntwo in-laws, who are citizens and residents of the Philippines. He resides with them when \nhe visits. He also has a property interest there through his wife. These relationships \ncreate a heightened risk of foreign pressure, coercion, and exploitation as documented \nby the U.S. State Department, which considers the country to pose a significant travel \nrisk. Additionally, its human rights record causes concern. These facts place a burden of \npersuasion on Applicant to demonstrate that his financial interests and ongoing \nrelationships with immediate family members and in-laws, who are resident citizens of \nthe Philippines, do not create a heightened risk of foreign influence or pose a security \nrisk. The evidence is sufficient to raise security concerns under AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(e), and \n7(f). \nApplicant\u2019s relationship with family members in the Philippines also creates a \npotential conflict of interest between his obligation to protect sensitive information or \ntechnology and his desire to help family members, should they be pressured, \nmanipulated, induced, or inclined to obtain access to such information. The evidence is \nsufficient to raise a disqualifying condition under AG \u00b6 7(b). \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant admitted that while he was residing outside of the United States, he \nfailed to report his association with a Moroccan woman, with whom he had an affair, as \nrequired by the U.S. government. The evidence establishes disqualifying conditions \nunder AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(c) and 7(i). \nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate these foreign influence security \nconcerns: \n(a) the nature of the relationship with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States;  \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements \nregarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, \ngroups, or organizations from a foreign country; and \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not be \nused effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \nApplicant did not credibly demonstrate that it is unlikely that he could be placed in \na position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual or government \nand those of the United States, as a consequence of his ongoing relationships with \nimmediate family members who are citizens and reside in the Philippines. Although he \nserved in the U.S. Army for 17 years, his connections to the Philippines through his family \nmay undermine any relationships and loyalties in the United States, such that if any \nconflict of interest arose, Applicant could not be expected to resolve it in favor of U.S. \ninterests. There is no evidence that he has significant financial interests in the United \nStates, only evidence that he owns a piece of property valued at US $3,000 in the \nPhilippines. He did not provide evidence to refute the allegation that he continues to own \nit. He did not provide evidence that he promptly disclosed his extramarital affair with a \nforeign person until his interview in February 2021. On balance, the evidence \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndemonstrates significant potential for conflicts of interest. Accordingly, Applicant failed to \nestablish persuasive mitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a), (b), (c), (e), or (f). \nGuideline D: Sexual Behavior \nAG \u00b6 12 expresses the security concern regarding sexual behavior: \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of judgment \nor discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence of coercion, \nexploitation, or duress. These issues, together or individually, may raise \nquestions about an individual's judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Sexual behavior \nincludes conduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, electronic, or \nwritten transmission. No adverse inference concerning the standards in this \nGuideline may be raised solely on the basis of the sexual orientation of the \nindividual. \nAG \u00b6 13 provides conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying: \n(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress. \nDuring Applicant\u2019s background interview in February 2021, he disclosed that since \nNovember 2020, he had been having an affair with a Moroccan woman, while he was \nliving in South Korea. He failed to report the relationship as required because he was \nconcerned the information would be used against him. He subsequently denied that he \nwas still having an affair when he submitted his Answer in July 2022; however, he did not \nprovide corroboration for his denial. The evidence establishes the above disqualifying \ncondition. \nAG \u00b6 14 describes conditions that could mitigate sexual behavior security \nconcerns: \n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under \nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment; \n(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and \n(d) the sexual behavior is strictly private, consensual, and discreet. \nApplicant became sexually involved with a foreign citizen in November 2020 while \nhe was living outside of the United States.

Although he subsequently \ndenied that he was involved with the foreign citizen in his Answer, there is no evidence to \ncorroborate that assertion. His sexual behavior is sufficiently recent, and casts doubt on \nhis reliability and judgment. AG \u00b6 14(b) does not apply There is no evidence to establish \nmitigation under AG \u00b6 14(c). Applicant did not assert that his extramarital relationship was \nprivate and consensual. AG \u00b6 14(d) is not established. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern regarding personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or cooperate \nwith security processing, including but not limited to meeting with a security \ninvestigator for subject interview, completing security forms or releases, \ncooperation with medical or psychological evaluation, or polygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful questions of \ninvestigators, security officials, or other official representatives in \nconnection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes a condition that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \nIn 2016 and 2018, Applicant received NJPs for wrongfully borrowing money from \nsoldiers and failing to reimburse them, and for falsely claiming that he was obtaining \nmoney to pay his rent and then dishonorably failing to pay his rent. In 2020, he began an \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nextramarital affair with a foreign person while he was living outside of the United States. \nHe failed to report the affair to the U.S. government, as required. These activities, if \nknown, could and did affect Applicant\u2019s personal and professional standing. The evidence \nestablishes the disqualifying condition under AG \u00b6 16(e)(1). \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate personal conduct security \nconcerns: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nSufficient time has not passed since Applicant\u2019s behavior occurred. In 2016 and \n2018, he received NJPs. In November 2020, he began an extramarital affair with a foreign \nperson while he was living outside the United States. He continued that affair into \nFebruary 2021, and possibly longer. He did not report this relationship to the Government \nas required, until his background interview in 2021. There is insufficient evidence to \nestablish mitigation under AG \u00b6 17(c). He did not present evidence demonstrating that he \nacknowledged his wrongful behavior and obtained counseling, or has taken other steps \nto address the stressors that contributed to his behaviors, such that he eliminated \nvulnerability to duress. AG \u00b6 17(d) does not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \na security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature person \nwho is accountable for his choices and actions. He has a history of failing to comply with \nthe law, rules, and regulations, as demonstrated by his history of poor financial \nmanagement, including a garnishment by the DFAS. He has received two NJPs for \nfinancial transgressions, and been involved in an extramarital affair with a foreign citizen \nwhile residing outside of the United States that he failed to report. There is insufficient \nevidence to establish permanent behavioral changes in Applicant\u2019s conduct or \ncompliance with the law, so I cannot conclude that similar conduct is unlikely to recur. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with substantial doubt as to Applicant\u2019s present \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. He did not meet his burden to mitigate \nthe security concerns arising under the financial considerations, foreign influence, sexual \nbehavior, and personal conduct guidelines. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \n AGAINST APPLICANT  \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:                                            Against Applicant \n     \nSubparagraph 1.b                                             For Applicant  \n \nSubparagraphs 1.c through 1.n:  \n         Against Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline B:  \n \n \n AGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a and 2.b: \n \n          Against Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline D:  \n \n \n AGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \n                                Against Applicant \nParagraph 4, Guideline E:  \n \n \n AGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 4.a:  \n                              Against Applicant \n14 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nConsidering the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility for \naccess to classified information.

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn March 16, 2022, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued to Applicant a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F, financial \nconsiderations. The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nOn May 26, 2022, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge.

The driver was ordered to pay restitution ($29,521) to \nApplicant as part of his probation but paid only $1,700.

I am having an accountant work on it. I just \nfinished 2020 taxes.\u201d (Tr. 54-55; GE 1) \nIn July 2021, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator. She \nexplained she had not filed her 2019 federal income tax return and was in the process of \nhaving her accountant prepare it, and it would be filed within the next month or so. She \nanticipated receiving a refund. She said she was otherwise current on all of her federal, \nstate, and local taxes. She explained that she had financial issues because of her 2015 \ncar accident, hospitalization for several months, the driver being uninsured, and she did \nnot have uninsured motorist insurance. (GE 2) \nIn Applicant\u2019s SOR answer, she provided a document showing her 2019 federal \ntax return was filed in April 2022 and she was entitled to a refund. Applicant testified that \nbecause of the nature of her work she is not at home often. Her tax documents were \nbeing forwarded to a former residence. She said she was surprised to hear that her \naccountant had not filed her 2021 or 2022 tax returns. She acknowledged that she failed \nto follow up on her inquiries to him. She also testified she thought her tax returns for the \npast two years were completed. In her post-hearing submission, she provided \nphotographs of text message threads to her accountant from April 2022 requesting him \nto complete her tax forms for tax year 2021. The threads are incomplete and only provide \nthe first two lines of the conversation. The thread then has a May 2022 date where \nApplicant is apparently sending her accountant some information. It then jumps to June \n28 and July 13, but does not indicate a year and appears to be from 2023. She is \nrequesting the status of her 2021 tax returns so she can provide the judge the information. \nThe information provided in this document is incomplete and is indecipherable. I am not \nin a position to guess what the rest of the text said or what tax year is being discussed. \n(Tr. 64-70, 119-122; GE 1; AE C, X) \nPost-hearing, Applicant provided an IRS document to show she e-signed her 2022 \nfederal tax return on July 13, 2023, and she owes $17,304, which includes penalties and \ninterest. No evidence was provided to show the tax debt was paid or a payment \narrangement was made. No evidence was provided to show Applicant has filed her 2021 \nfederal tax return.

In her SOR answer, she denied the \ndebt in SOR \u00b6 1.m. She testified that she only had one credit card at the time of her \naccident and has disputed the others through Credit Karma. This is inconsistent with the \ndebts she disclosed in her SCA. She has not contacted the creditors to obtain information \nabout the debts. The debts have different account numbers and were opened at different \ntimes. She also denied the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.p ($198). She testified that this is a medical \ndebt for an emergency room visit from 2021. She did not have medical insurance. She \nsaid she paid it and would provide proof. She did not.

This contradicts her SOR answer. \nShe said she contacted the creditor several weeks before her hearing and had a \nsettlement offer. In her post-hearing submission, she provided a document from the \ncreditor offering her options to settle the debt.

(Tr. 126-148 AE M, N, O, P, R) \nAny derogatory information that was not alleged in the SOR will not be considered \nfor disqualifying purposes. It may be considered in the application of mitigating conditions, \nin making a credibility determination, and in a whole-person analysis. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income taxes as \nrequired. \nApplicant has numerous delinquent debts. She failed to timely file her 2019, 2021 \nand 2022 federal income tax returns. There is sufficient evidence to support the \napplication of the above disqualifying conditions. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and  \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant was the victim of a horrific car accident in 2015 that seriously impacted \nher physically. Her parents\u2019 divorce and the circumstances surrounding her father\u2019s \nincarceration and misuse of her credit also seriously impacted her finances whereby it \nwas costly for her to obtain credit. I have considered that her earnings were reduced while \nshe recuperated from her injuries. I have also considered that the driver who caused the \naccident was uninsured and failed to pay restitution. These were conditions beyond \nApplicant\u2019s control. \nIt is unfortunate that some of Applicant\u2019s medical expenses were not covered by \nher insurance. It is unfortunate that she chose not to have uninsured motorist coverage. \nIt is also unfortunate that when making a car purchase, Applicant had to pay a high \ninterest rate. When Applicant completed her SCA and was interviewed by a government \ninvestigator, she disclosed delinquent debts that she was responsible to pay for medical \nservices rendered or for purchases she made using credit cards.

She provided one \ndocument to show she made a $25 student loan payment after receiving the SOR. The \nfact that certain debts have been charged off does not mean she acted responsibly \ntowards addressing them. There is insufficient evidence to conclude that Applicant has \nacted responsibly regarding her delinquent debts. AG \u00b6 20(b) partially applies. \nIn her SCA, Applicant disclosed that she failed to timely file her 2019 federal \nincome tax return, and it would be completed soon. She told the investigator in July 2021 \nthat it would be filed in the next month or so. She provided a document to show it was \nfiled in April 2022, after receipt of the SOR. She failed to provide proof that her federal \nincome tax return was filed for 2021. Her 2022 federal tax return was filed late in July \n2023. She owes more than $17,000 for tax year 2022. AG \u00b6 20(g) applies to her 2019 \nand 2022 tax returns. It does not apply to her 2021 federal income tax return. \nThere is no evidence that Applicant has received financial counseling or that there \nare clear indications that her problems are being resolved or under control. AG \u00b6 20(c) \ndoes not apply. Applicant has not made good-faith efforts to repay her delinquent debts, \nexcept for one. AG \u00b6 20(d) only applies to SOR \u00b6 1.q. Applicant has made minimal effort \nto repay her creditors. Her debts are numerous and recent. Not all of her debts are \nmedical or the result of her accident. She purchased a vehicle for her boyfriend and failed \nto make the payments. She has been offered a settlement, but it remains unresolved. AG \n\u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \nApplicant acknowledged incurring medical and credit cards debts and disclosed \nthem on her SCA, but then disputed their legitimacy because she was a victim in a car \naccident, and she is unable to pay them. She has failed to provide documented proof as \nto why these are not legitimate debts and evidence of actions to resolve them. AG \u00b6 20(e) \ndoes not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that Guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nFailure to comply with tax laws suggests that an applicant has a problem with \nabiding by well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary compliance with \nrules and systems is essential for protecting classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case \nNo. 16-01726 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 28, 2018). A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or \nher legal obligations, such as filing tax returns and paying taxes when due, does not \ndemonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of those granted \naccess to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01382 at 4 (App. Bd. May \n16, 2018). This is true even when the returns are eventually filed and the taxes paid. \nApplicant has not established a reliable financial track record. She has not met her \nburden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F, \nfinancial considerations. 1\nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a-1.p: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.q: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.r: \nAgainst Applicant \n1 In Applicant\u2019s SOR answer, she requested consideration of a waiver with appropriate conditions. The \nadjudicative guidelines give me the authority to grant conditional eligibility \u201cdespite the presence of issue \ninformation that can be partially but not completely mitigated, with the provision that additional security \nmeasures shall be required to mitigate the issue(s).\u201d I have not done so as I have concluded a conditional \nclearance in this case is not warranted.  \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Gregorian, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n01/25/2023 \nDecision \nMASON, Paul J., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant receives mitigation for eliminating most of his federal tax issues. \nHowever, the mitigation is insufficient to overcome the remaining security concerns \nraised under the guideline for financial considerations Eligibility for classified information \nis denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn May 4, 2021, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) to obtain a security clearance required for a position \nwith a defense contractor. On November 120, 2021, he provided an interview (PSI) to \nan investigator from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). After reviewing the \nresults of the security background investigation, the Defense Counterintelligence \nSecurity Agency (DCSA) could not make the affirmative findings required to grant a \nsecurity clearance, and issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated \nDecember 15, 2021, detailing security concerns under financial considerations \n1 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(Guideline F). The action was taken under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective on June \n8, 2017. \nApplicant furnished his answer on December 21, 2021, without comment. In an \nemail dated December 22, 2021, Applicant provided a supplemental explanation for the \nlisted debts, his youngest daughter\u2019s drug problems, and his shoulder injury. The \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on \nNovember 15, 2022, for a hearing on November 30, 2022. The hearing was held as \nscheduled by via MICROSOFT TEAMS. The Government\u2019s five exhibits (GE) 1-5 were \nentered into evidence without objection. Applicant did not offer any exhibits. He testified. \nThe record remained open until December 22, 2022, to allow Applicant an \nopportunity to submit post-hearing documentation about his assertions of resolving his \ndelinquent tax obligations. Applicant submitted post-hearing exhibit AE A documenting \npayments to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). I have also marked and admitted into \nevidence AE B (email documentation from November 23 through December 2, 2021) \nbetween Applicant and one of the DOHA adjudicators related to SOR \u00b6 1.b. (AE B at 1-\n4) This documentation includes a December 1, 2021 payment of $508 to the state tax \nagency identified in SOR \u00b6 1.b. The documentation was included with Applicant\u2019s \ninterrogatory answers supplied on November 20, 2021 (GE 2 at 1-29), and resubmitted \nby Applicant to the Government as part of his answer to the SOR. The record in this \ncase closed on December 13, 2022, when Department Counsel indicated that he had \nno objection to AE A. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on December 12, \n2022. References to the pages of the Government and Applicant\u2019s exhibits cite the \nhandwritten page number located in the lower right hand corner of the page. At the \nbeginning of the hearing, Department Counsel\u2019s video transmission was lost, but he \nproceeded with the remainder of the hearing by audio. (Tr. 34)  \n \nFindings of Fact \nThe SOR alleges three delinquent federal and state tax allegations, two past-\ndue student loans, and eight delinquent commercial debts, including one medical \naccount. The delinquent federal tax debt (SOR \u00b6 1.c) amounts to $4,198. The student \nloan debt (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.f) totals $55,264. The total amount of commercial debt \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.g-1.l), including one medical account (SOR \u00b6 1.m), comes to $5,461. \nThe sum of the ten listed accounts is $60,725. Applicant admitted all SOR allegations. \nHe had no objection to the Government exhibits, although he did not bring all the \nexhibits to the hearing because he did not know he needed the exhibits. The student \nloan and commercial debts became delinquent between February 2014 and October 20, \n2020.

After 25 years of marriage, he separated from his wife \nin January 2021 because of her poor financial decisions, and is anticipating a divorce. \nHe has two daughters, ages 26 and 22, from this marriage. He also has a 37-year-old \nson from his first marriage; his 36-year-old stepdaughter passed away due to drug \nproblems. Applicant has two associate\u2019s degrees in electronics and electronic motors \nthat he received in 2006 and 2010. He has been working as a heating and air \nconditioning technician for a defense contractor since January 2021. He spent the last \nthree months of 2020 working as a maintenance technician. From September 2010 to \nJune 2020, he was employed as a journeyman electrician for a transportation company. \nHe has never held a security clearance. (GE 1 at 9-24; AE 2 at 9; Tr. 7, 30-37) \nApplicant believes his financial problems were caused by trusting his wife to \npay the bills. While he was working for the transportation company (2010-2020), he \ncommuted between work and his home on the weekends. Applicant was 45 to 55 years \nold during the period. Regarding management of the family\u2019s financial obligations, he \nearned the money and his wife paid the bills. He met her weekly to talk about paying the \nbills. They used a notebook to track the bills. He directed his wife to set aside $100 a \nweek to pay the delinquent taxes. He claimed he was deceived because she did not pay \nthe taxes. His youngest daughter\u2019s drug problems between 2016 and 2018 required the \nexpenditure of several thousand dollars for her treatment and recovery. After her \nrecovery, she became a nurse. Applicant was on disability for about a year (circa 2017) \ndue to a shoulder injury followed by two failed surgeries before doctors fully repaired the \nshoulder. During this period, he was on disability leave drawing 70% of his regular \nsalary. (December 22, 2021 supplemental email-statement submitted the next day \nfollowing his answer to the SOR; GE 2 at 8-9; Tr. 36-38, 41-45) \nSOR \u00b6 1.a \u2013 Applicant testified that he filed a federal tax return for tax year \n2017 and taxes were paid. (Tr. 24) The record contains no federal tax account transcript \nfor tax year 2017 to verify that Applicant filed a 2017 federal tax return. I find this \nallegation against Applicant. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b \u2013 Applicant provided documentation of paying the state tax agency \n$508 on December 1, 2021. Though the record contains no evidence of a filed 2017 \nstate tax return, the record does show that conflicting information supplied by state tax \nofficials to Applicant foiled his attempts to obtain a 2017 state tax return for DOHA \nadjudicators. (AE B 1-2) This allegation is resolved in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nSOR \u00b6 1.c \u2013 The posted delinquent federal tax totals $4,198 for 2017, 2018 and \n2019. No documentation was produced to indicate how much Applicant paid to bring \ndown the delinquent Internal Revenue Service (IRS) balance to $2,200. He provided \ndocumentation showing that his payment of $2,619 on December 12, 2021, was applied \nto federal tax years 2018 and 2019. (AE A) Whether this amount eliminates the entire \nbalance in delinquent taxes for federal tax years 2017, 2018, and 2019, is impossible to \ndetermine without supporting documentation of the original amount that he owed the \nIRS. For tax year 2021, Applicant claimed that he filed federal and state tax returns, but \n3 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nstill owes $800 for the year. (Tr. 49-51) Based on the evidence, I find in his favor under \nthis allegation, even though there is no indication of any payments for federal tax year \n2017. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e \u2013 These are two delinquent student loan accounts. The \naccounts were opened in 2006 and 2010 by other lenders and were eventually \ntransferred to the federal agency as collection accounts. The federal agency opened \nboth accounts in August 2014, with the last payment activity on the accounts in \nSeptember 2016. When Applicant opened the accounts, he used the student loan \nmoney to pay his bills rather than to pay for the two associate degrees. (GE 4 at 4-5; \nGE 5 at 5; Tr. 51-52) These two accounts are unresolved. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.g-1.m \u2013 These are seven commercial accounts and one medical \naccount (SOR \u00b6 1.m) The accounts became delinquent between February 2014 and \nOctober 2020. SOR \u00b6 1.d, a credit-card account became delinquent in October 2020. \nSOR \u00b6 1.g represents a past-due internet service account that became delinquent in \nJune 2019. SOR \u00b6 1.h is a mobile phone account that fell delinquent in August 2020. \nSOR \u00b6 1.i, a credit-card account, became delinquent in May 2017. A car loan account \n(SOR \u00b6 1.j) became delinquent in February 2014, after Applicant\u2019s daughter totaled the \nfamily car and the insurance company did not cover the full amount owed to the car \ncompany. SOR \u00b6 1.k represents an unpaid insurance bill. SOR \u00b6 1.l is an unpaid credit \nunion account that became delinquent in December 2015. SOR \u00b6 1.m is an unpaid \nmedical bill for Applicant\u2019s treatment while on disability leave. The account became \ndelinquent in December 2019. Applicant indicated that he has not acted on the ten \ndebts (the seven commercial, one medical, and two student loan accounts) because he \nhas been trying to clear his past-due federal and state taxes. (GE 2 at 9-10; Tr. 53-54) \nThese ten accounts remain unresolved. \nApplicant earns about $74,880 a year with his current employer. (Tr. 40-41) His \nrent is $1,050 a month. His car payment is $252 a month. After payment of expenses, \nincluding $100 a week in pre-divorce alimony, his monthly remainder is between $1,100 \nand $1,200 a month. He has $3,200 in savings and $800 in checking. He has $11,000 \nin his retirement account. He has never participated in financial counseling, debt \nmanagement, or debt consolidation services. (Tr. 46, 54-57) \nAt the hearing, Applicant testified that he did not discover that his wife was not \npaying bills and taxes until shortly before he submitted his May 2021 e-QIP. He \ndefended this claim because he was living away from home on weekends between \n2010 and 2020, and not always present to witness his wife manage the bills. He was not \nmeeting with his wife over the bills (as he testified to earlier). Instead, she showed him \nher notebook entries of which bills she supposedly paid and did not pay. He never \nlooked at the mail and she never showed him collection notices or bills. He testified that \nthey had been utilizing this practice for 25 years. Between 2016 and 2018, he also was \nstruggling with his youngest daughter\u2019s drug addiction and the cost of her recovery. \nAdditionally, he was coping with his shoulder injury and surgeries. (Tr. 44-45, 58-60) I \ndo not find Applicant\u2019s explanations credible. Directing his wife to pay $100 a week \n4 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \ntoward the taxes implies that he knew or should have known the taxes were delinquent. \nFurther, the reason for his separation from his wife in January 2021 was due to her poor \nfinancial decisions. (AE 2 at 9) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines should \nbe applied with common sense and the general factors of the whole-person concept. \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. The \nprotection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(d) requires \nthat \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security eligibility \nwill be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . ..\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security decision. \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nThe security concerns of the guideline for financial considerations are set forth \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, \nmental health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or \ndependence. An individual who is financially overextended is at greater \nrisk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to \ngenerate funds. Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of \nincome is also a security concern insofar as it may result from criminal \nactivity, including espionage. \nAG \u00b619 describes conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n5 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file for fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local \nincome tax as required. \nThe Government\u2019s credit reports, Applicant\u2019s December 2021 answer to the \nSOR, and the record establish the Government\u2019s case under the guideline for financial \nconsiderations. Since the February 2014, Applicant has accumulated a history of not \nmeeting his financial obligations. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply to Applicant\u2019s inability to \nsatisfy the accounts identified in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d-1.m. AG \u00b6 19(f) applies to his failure to file \nFederal and state tax returns and pay the corresponding taxes. \nThe pertinent mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 include: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the \nproblem is being resolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(f) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply to the medical, student loan, and commercial debts. \nThough three debts became delinquent in 2014, seven of the debts changed to a \ndelinquent status between 2017 and 2020. While Applicant has severed his relationship \nin January 2021 with the person he believes caused his financial problems, he still owes \nthe debts. His inability to address the debts by some level of contact with the creditors \n6 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nto set up payment plans, or at least advise the creditors why he cannot pay them \npresently, continues to cast doubt on his current reliability and judgment. \nApplicant receives mitigation under the first prong of AG \u00b6 20(b) because of his \nyoungest daughter\u2019s drug problems from 2016 to 2018, and the cost associated with her \ntreatment and recovery. Applicant\u2019s shoulder injury in 2017 and the surgeries required \nto fix the condition was the second unforeseen event that was largely beyond his \ncontrol. However, to receive full credit, an applicant must act responsibly under the \ncircumstances. I believe that when Applicant moved to the local area in January 2021, \nrather than in May 2021, he knew that his taxes and the other debts were not being \npaid. Overall, Applicant receives limited mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(b). \nAG \u00b6 20(c) applies when there is evidence of financial counseling and there are \nclear indications the problem is being resolved or under control. Applicant has never \nhad financial counseling. Furthermore, there are no clear indications that the ten debts \nare being resolved or under control. AG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply. AG \u00b6 20(d) must be \nremoved from consideration because Applicant has taken no action to repay the \ncreditors or collection agencies. \nApplicant\u2019s documented efforts in unsuccessfully trying to obtain the 2017 state \ntax return, combined with his documented payments to eliminate his federal tax \nobligations for tax years 2018 and 2019, entitle him to mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(g), \neven though the record does not show tax payments for federal tax year 2017. The \nmitigating condition does not apply SOR \u00b6 1.a because Applicant has submitted no \nproof that he filed the 2017 federal tax return. \nWhole-Person Concept \nI have examined the evidence under the specific guideline (financial \nconsiderations) in the context of the nine general factors of the whole-person concept \nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \naccess to classified information must be an overall common-sense judgment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n7 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n______________ \nApplicant is 58 years old and has two daughters from his current wife. He also \nhas a son from his first marriage. Though he has taken documented action on his \nfederal and state taxes, he has done nothing regarding his two student loans and the \nother listed debts. In Guideline F cases, the DOHA Appeal Board has repeatedly held \nthat, for an applicant to successfully establish his case in mitigation, he must present a \n\u201cmeaningful track record\u201d of debt repayments that result in debt reduction.

Her admissions are incorporated into these findings of fact. After a review of the\npleadings and evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is a 61-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She began working \nat her present job in April 2006. She has worked for U.S. defense contractors for \napproximately 30 years. She has held a security clearance for 19 years, without any \nsecurity incidents. She holds an associate degree. She married in 1985 and divorced in \n2017. She has two adult children. (Tr. 6, 21-22, 25; GE 1) \nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleged that Applicant failed to timely file her federal \nincome tax returns for tax years 2014 through 2020, as required. Applicant\u2019s admissions \nestablish the SOR allegations, except for tax year 2020. (GE 1-3; SOR answer) \nApplicant accepted responsibility for failing to timely file her federal income tax \nreturns for the years indicated. She also provided explanations for events happening in \nher life that impacted her ability to file these tax returns at the time. \nWhen Applicant was married to her ex-husband, he took the responsibility for \nfiling the family\u2019s tax returns. He owned a small business, which required that a more \ncomplex tax return was required. She would compile all of her tax-related documents, \nput them in an envelope, and give them to her ex-husband at tax time. That was the \nextent of her involvement with the tax-filing process during her marriage. Once she was \ndivorced in 2017, she had to learn how to file her returns and pay any taxes herself. She \nsought the help and advice from a friend and tax preparer to mentor her on the tax \nprocess. Both she and her ex-husband have used this person to help prepare their tax \nreturns for the past 30 years. (Tr. 22, 27-28) \nIn October 2018, Applicant\u2019s home was nearly destroyed by Hurricane Michael. \nShe suffered property damage valued at approximately $200,000. She also had to pay \nout-of-pocket for immediate repairs to her home to make it habitable. She would later be \nreimbursed by insurance for the damage, but only after she hired an attorney. While she \nwas generally made whole by the insurance payment, the last payment was finally \nreceived in May or June 2023, some five years after the event. The hurricane impacted \nher tax situation because the repair expenses took funds away from being applied \ntoward any tax debt. She also was unable to contact her tax mentor, who was severely \nimpacted by the hurricane until sometime in 2019. Applicant found out later that the \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTY 2014 \nShe contacted the IRS but was unable to receive a copy of this \nreturn.

Applicant prepared draft tax \nreturns on her own for 2017 and 2018. These drafts reflected that she would owe \nmoney to the IRS for both years. She erroneously believed she could not file her tax \nreturn if she owed money but could not pay it at the time she filed the return. As a result, \nshe waited until she accumulated enough funds to pay her taxes owed before she filed \nthe returns for 2017 and 2018. (Tr. 28, 32-33, 35-36, 38-39, 51-52) \nApplicant documented her federal income tax return filings below: \nApplicant credibly testified that she has learned from her mistakes and has since \ntimely filed her federal income tax returns. She has received tax refunds for the past \nfour tax years. While a copy of her 2014 tax transcript was unavailable, she owes no \ntaxes for that year. This is also a tax return her husband would have prepared and filed. \nShe admitted that the security clearance process lit a fire for her to file the late returns. \nAll the late returns were filed before the issuance of the SOR. (Tr. 22-23; AE A) \nApplicant\u2019s facility security officer (FSO) testified that he has known her since \n2006 and highly respects her. She is trustworthy, reliable, and exercises good \njudgment. He is personally aware of the damage she suffered because of the hurricane \nin 2018, and the difficulty she faced dealing with the insurance company. She is not the \ntype of person who is a tax protestor. He was also aware of her efforts to work with the \nIRS to resolve her tax issues. (Tr. 41-50) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process.

According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern for financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence.

I have \nconsidered all of them under AG \u00b6 19 and the following potentially apply: \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nThe evidence showed Applicant failed to timely file her federal income tax returns \nfor tax years 2014-2019, but 2020 was timely filed. I find the above disqualifying \nconditions are raised for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.f, but SOR \u00b6 1.g was not established. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 20 and the following potentially apply: \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant should have responded in a timelier fashion to resolve her tax issues. \nHowever, she faced legitimate obstacles that contributed to her delayed action. Before \n2017, her ex-husband always filed their joint tax returns. Once she was divorced and \nstarted filing her own returns, she sought guidance from her long-time tax preparer. \nAfter the hurricane of 2018, which destroyed much of Applicant\u2019s home, it also made it \nimpossible to contact her tax preparer because she was also impacted by the hurricane. \nThis led to Applicant\u2019s erroneous assumption that she could not file her tax returns for \nyears that she owed taxes if she was unable to pay at the time of her filings. Her \ninability to pay, at that time, was caused by having to pay out-of-pocket to repair her \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhome before she was reimbursed by her insurance. She demonstrated responsible \naction by working with the IRS to resolve her tax issues. Ultimately, Applicant was able \nto file all the missing returns and for the last three years (2020-2022) did so in a timely \nmanner. There is no evidence of any other tax issues. Moreover, there are clear \nindications that her tax issues are resolved, and recurrence is unlikely because she now \nhas a firm handle on her tax filing responsibilities. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b)-20(c), and 20(g) all \nsubstantially apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guideline and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \nI considered Applicant\u2019s contractor service and the testimony of her FSO who \nwholeheartedly supports her to retain her clearance. I\u2019m convinced she will act in a \ntimely manner filing her tax returns from now on. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the financial considerations security concerns and that one \nallegation was not established. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs: 1.a - 1.g: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

He \nneither admitted nor denied SOR \u00b6 3.a, so I have construed his silence as a denial of that \nallegation. He is 31 years old. As of the date of the hearing, he was not married, and he \ndid not have any children. He graduated from high school in 2011 and subsequently \nattended college until 2014 but did not earn a degree.

He was subsequently unemployed until approximately September 2020, in \npreparation for joining the U.S. Marine Corps (USMC). He briefly served in the USMC, \nfrom September 2020 to January 2021, when he was administratively discharged for \nmisconduct and received an other than honorable (OTH) discharge, as further discussed \nbelow. In approximately 2021, he accepted a position with a DOD contractor contingent \non obtaining a security clearance, and that company was sponsoring him for a clearance \nas of the date of the hearing. He was unemployed for about a month and a half while \nawaiting the outcome of his clearance, and then he obtained contract work through an \nemployment agency. When he was in between contracts, he had one to two brief periods \nof unemployment. In 2022, he began working full time for his employer, a private \ncompany, as a security system engineer.

(Answer; GE 1-5) \nApplicant attributed his delinquent debts primarily to his periods of unemployment \nand underemployment since 2014, when he left college to begin working. His parents \nassisted him financially during this period. He was unaware that he had any delinquent \ndebts until the investigator asked him about them during his 2019 background interview. \nOnce he became aware of them, he started to try to resolve them. (Tr. at 23-26, 45, 48, \n54-56, 58, 63-68, 75-76; GE 1, 5; AE E) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b are two federal student loans, in collection for $8,676 and \n$8,358, respectively. Applicant attended college on an athletic scholarship but lost his \nscholarship after he was injured during his freshman year. His parents bore the cost of \nhis college tuition at a time when they were experiencing financial difficulties. He believed \nhis parents paid for his college education and that his father, with whom he has the same \nname, obtained these loans to pay for his last years of college. He did not recall signing \nany loan paperwork, so he was unaware that he had any student loans, or that the student \nloans were delinquent, until he was informed about them during his background interview. \n(Tr. at 22-23, 36-42, 58-63; GE 2, 3, 4, 5; AE A, E). \nApplicant indicated during his background interview that he had not been \ncontacted to repay any outstanding student loans, but he was willing to repay them. At \nthe hearing, he stated that he understood the loans were his obligation since they were \nreported on his credit reports. He believed his parents had been paying these loans in \naccordance with a payment arrangement, and he contributed by providing them with $50 \nmonthly, until payments on his student loans were deferred during the COVID-19 \npayment pause. The U.S. Department of Education deferred student loan payments \nbeginning in March 2020, to provide relief to borrowers during the COVID-19 pandemic. \nSee \nhttps://studentaid.gov/announcements-events/covid-19/payment-pause-zero-\ninterest. He did not provide documentation to corroborate his claims of payment before \nthe COVID-19 payment pause. He understood that he was obligated to pay these loans \nonce the payment pause was lifted, and he intended to do so. These student loans are \nnot reported on the most recent credit bureau report from May 2023. (Tr. at 22-23, 36-42, \n58-63; GE 2, 3, 4, 5; AE A, C, E) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c is an apartment rental account in collection for $3,924. Applicant lived \nin this apartment from approximately July 2015 to March 2019, when he broke his lease \nto move to a different state in pursuit of better job opportunities. He contacted the creditor \nand settled the debt for $2,700, which he stated he paid with savings. As of December \n2021, this debt was paid. (Tr. at 42-47, 65-66; GE 2, 3, 4, 5; AE B) \nSOR \u00b6 1.d is a medical account in collection for $68. Applicant indicated during \nhis background interview that this debt was for treatment he received in approximately \nSeptember 2015. At the hearing, he stated that he paid this debt but he could not recall \nwhen he did so. This debt was not reported on the most recent credit bureau reports from \nSeptember 2022 and May 2023.

In 2017, Applicant traded his \nSUV for a used car. He was subsequently unable to make his monthly payments because \nhe signed a high interest auto loan, and he was transitioning between jobs. His car was \nrepossessed in March 2018. He believed that his car was auctioned and sold to cover his \noutstanding balance. He stated that he had never been contacted regarding any \ndeficiency balance and he did not believe he had one. Although this debt was reported \nwith a zero balance on the most recent credit bureau reports from September 2022 and \nMay 2023, the latter credit bureau report continues to note that this account was charged \noff for $18,471. He did not provide documentation of his efforts to address this debt. (Tr. \nat 47-50, 66, 75-76; GE 2, 3, 4) \nThe SOR also alleged, under Guideline E, that Applicant intentionally falsified his \nresponse to section 26 of his May 2019 SCA, which inquired about his financial \ndelinquencies, when he marked \u201cNo\u201d and failed to disclose his delinquent debts in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.e. (SOR \u00b6 2.a) As previously stated, Applicant indicated during his background \ninterview that he did not list his debts because he was unaware of them. He \nacknowledged at the hearing that although he was aware the car securing the debt in \nSOR \u00b6 1.e was repossessed, he did not list it because he was confused by the question, \nsince the repossession occurred before he completed the SCA. He did not recall \ncompleting the SCA, and it was the first time he had ever completed one. (Tr. at 40, 50-\n52, 76-80; GE 5) \nApplicant\u2019s annual income as of the date of the hearing and since 2022 was \napproximately $80,000. His monthly net pay was approximately $5,500. He anticipated \nthat his monthly net remainder after expenses, to include his monthly rent of $1,200, \nwould be approximately $3,200. He uses a budget to manage his finances. He had $5,500 \nin savings. He has been working to rebuild his credit. Although he stated that he does not \nhave any other delinquent debts, his most recent credit bureau report from May 2023, \nwhich reflects a fair credit score, reports a new account in collection for $970. He has not \nreceived credit counseling. (Tr. at 52-58, 76; AE A. C) \nAs discussed above, Applicant briefly served in the USMC from September 2020 \nto January 2021, when he was administratively discharged for misconduct and received \nan OTH discharge. Records pertaining to his discharge reflect that he was the subject of \nnon-judicial punishment (NJP) in October 2020, for violating Article 90 (willfully disobeying \na superior commissioned officer) and Article 91 (insubordinate conduct), when, in \nSeptember 2020 and November 2020, he refused orders to train, and he refused to \nexecute such orders. He waived an administrative separation board and understood that \nhe received a punitive mark on his record and an OTH discharge. He stated: \nI initially entered the Marine Corps with a 0321 contract, which is \n[reconnaissance] in infantry, which is what I initially signed up for and\ntrained for. And then during the pipeline in my training process, I was then\nreclassified to the needs of the Marine Corps to aviation tech, an aviation \nmechanic, essentially, which was an undesirable position for me to have. \nSo I respectfully went to my commanding officer to see if anything could be \ndone to make those changes and if there\u2019s any way that I can either \n \n \n \n \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncontinue my service in a desirable field or leave the service altogether.

So my commanding officer put me on a quote-unquote fast track, \nwhich is an NJP board, so I would be administratively discharged. (SOR \u00b6 \n3.a; Tr. at 26-36, 71-75; AE D) \nAfter completing 13 weeks of USMC training, Applicant was awarded Company \nHonorman for demonstrating exceptional leadership qualities, physical fitness, \nmarksmanship, and overall performance. He does not have any other incidents involving \nunfavorable or criminal behavior. Numerous character references, to include his father, \nfriends, and several individuals with whom he served in the USMC attested to Applicant\u2019s \ntrustworthiness, reliability, and judgment. (AE A, E) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information.

Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or \nsensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . .. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of not being able to pay his debts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) \nare established. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond\nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn,\nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear\nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n \n \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nCircumstances beyond Applicant\u2019s control contributed to his financial problems. \nNonetheless, under AG \u00b6 20(b), he must provide evidence that he acted responsibly \nunder his circumstances. He paid SOR \u00b6 1.c in December 2021, before the SOR. The \nlatest credit bureau reports corroborate his claim that he also paid SOR \u00b6 1.d. I therefore \nfind those allegations in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nAs stated above, Applicant failed to show that he made any payments toward his \ndelinquent student loans before the COVID-19 payment pause that began in March 2020. \nHe also failed to provide documentation of his efforts to address his auto loan, which \ncontinues to be reported as a $18,471 charged-off account on the most recent credit \nbureau report from May 2023, despite its zero balance. That credit report also reflects \nthat he has incurred another delinquent debt, in collection for $970. He has not received \nfinancial counseling. While he now has the means to resolve his debts, he needs more \ntime to establish a track record of doing so. I find that these financial issues continue to \ncast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), and \n20(d) do not apply to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.e. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect\nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to\ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security\ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . . \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I considered the following relevant: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nApplicant credibly testified that he did not deliberately falsify his 2019 SCA. He \nwas unaware of his delinquent debts until he was told about them during his background \ninterview. Although he knew his car was repossessed, he did not list it because he was \nconfused by the question. AG \u00b6 16(a) is not established. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct  \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct as: \n\u201c[c]riminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness \nto comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\u201d \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I considered the following relevant: \u201c(e) discharge or dismissal from the \nArmed Forces for reasons less than \u2018Honorable.\u2019\u201d Applicant was administratively \ndischarged for misconduct and he received an OTH discharge from the USMC in January \n2021. AG \u00b6 31(e) is established. \nAG \u00b6 32 provides the following relevant mitigating conditions: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nApplicant accepted responsibility for his OTH discharge. He does not have any \nother incidents involving unfavorable or criminal behavior. I find that enough time has \nelapsed since his criminal behavior and without recurrence of criminal activity. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n32(a) and 32(d) are established. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F, Guideline E, \nand Guideline J in my whole-person analysis. Overall, the record evidence leaves me \nwith questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. I conclude that Applicant mitigated the personal conduct and criminal conduct \nsecurity concerns, but he did not mitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c-1.d: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline J: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of Exec. Or. \n10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall \nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also \nExec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or \nsensitive information).   \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern for drug involvement and substance misuse is set out in AG \n\u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline notes the following applicable conditions that could raise security \nconcerns under AG \u00b6 25: \n(a) any substance misuse . . . ;  \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of\ndrug paraphernalia; and \n \n \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nApplicant used marijuana from May 2020 to April 2021. Her use of marijuana from \nMay 2020 to April 2021 occurred while she was granted access to classified information. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), 25(c), and 25(f) are established. \nConditions that could mitigate the drug involvement and substance misuse security \nconcerns are provided under AG \u00b6 26. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nI find that AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a), 26(b)(1), 26(b)(2), and 26(b)(3) are established. Applicant \nacknowledged that she exercised poor judgment when she chose to manage her anxiety \nwith marijuana during the COVID-19 pandemic while holding a security clearance. She \nstopped using marijuana as soon as she received her COVID-19 vaccination, she sought \nmedical help, and she has been managing her anxiety under her doctor\u2019s care. She \ndisclosed information about her marijuana use on her SCA and during her background \ninterview. She testified that she had no intention to use illegal drugs in the future, and she \nsigned a statement of intent to abstain from illegal drug use and any violation would be \ngrounds for automatic revocation of her security clearance. The record evidence resolves \ndoubts about Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. I found Applicant to be \nremorseful, candid, and credible at the hearing. She has taken responsibility for her past \ndrug use while holding a security clearance. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct  \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . . \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I considered the following relevant: \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: (1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing . . . . \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant displayed untrustworthiness, questionable judgment, and unreliability \nwhen she chose to use marijuana from May 2020 and April 2021 while possessing a \nclearance. AG \u00b6 16(e)(1) is established. \nI have considered all of the mitigating conditions under \u00b6 AG 17 and considered \nthe following relevant: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nFor the same reasons set forth above in my Guideline H analysis, I find that \u00b6\u00b6 AG \n17(c), 17(d), and 17(e) are established. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guidelines H and E in my \nwhole-person analysis. I had the opportunity to observe Applicant\u2019s demeanor during her \nhearing and found that she was credible, candid, and remorseful. Overall, the record \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nevidence leaves me without questions or doubts about Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability \nfor a security clearance. I conclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns involving \ndrug involvement and substance misuse and personal conduct. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.b:  \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a:  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nCandace Le\u2019i Garcia \nAdministrative Judge \n7 \n",

(Tr. at 49-51; GE 6) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern for criminal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about an Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable: \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted; \nand \n(c) individual is currently on parole or probation. \nApplicant has a history of criminal conduct going back to 1979. He is on \nprobation under a deferred adjudication for theft of property greater than or equal to \n$30,000 and less than $150,000. The above disqualifying conditions are applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate criminal conduct security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 32. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the \noffense; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nDuring his background interview in February 2021, Applicant stated that he did \nnot participate in the 1979 burglary and that he stayed in the car while his two friends \nburglarized the store. At his hearing, he admitted that he participated in the burglary. He \nis paying $32,000 in restitution and court costs for damaged computer parts that he \nadmits taking, but he stated that he only received about $200 for the parts. Because of \nhis previous inconsistent statements about a previous burglary, it is difficult to give great \nweight to his statements about this theft. The phrase falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus \n(false in one thing, false in everything) is not necessarily true, but it is sufficient to give \npause and leave lingering doubts. \nIt has been more than six years since the criminal conduct, but Applicant remains \non probation. I have unmitigated concerns. Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct continues to \ncast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and willingness to \ncomply with laws, rules, and regulations. The above mitigating conditions, individually or \ncollectively, are insufficient to alleviate those concerns. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \nclearance investigative or adjudicative processes. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information; and \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.a cross-alleges the criminal conduct alleged under Guideline J. \nApplicant\u2019s conduct reflects questionable judgment and an unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations. It also created vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, and \nduress. AG \u00b6 16(e) is applicable. AG \u00b6 16(c) is not perfectly applicable because \nApplicant\u2019s conduct is sufficient for an adverse determination under the criminal conduct \nguideline. However, the general concerns about questionable judgment and an \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations contained in AG \u00b6\u00b6 15 and 16(c) are \nestablished. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability. \nUnder the same rationale discussed above for criminal conduct, Applicant \nremains vulnerable to exploitation, manipulation, and duress. His conduct continues to \ncast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Personal \nconduct security concerns are not mitigated. \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence.

The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(d) deceptive or illegal financial practices such as embezzlement, \nemployee theft, check fraud, expense account fraud, mortgage fraud, filing \ndeceptive loan statements and other intentional financial breaches of trust. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems and delinquent debts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) \nand 19(c) are applicable. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.b and 3.c allege duplicate accounts. When the same conduct is \nalleged twice in the SOR under the same guideline, one of the duplicative allegations \nshould be resolved in Applicant\u2019s favor. See ISCR Case No. 03-04704 at 3 (App. Bd. \nSep. 21, 2005). SOR \u00b6 3.b is concluded for Applicant. \nSOR \u00b6 3.g cross-alleges the 2017 charge of theft of property from his employer. \nApplicant stole computer equipment from his employer. That is an intentional financial \nbreach of trust. AG \u00b6 19(d) is applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nApplicant paid in full the $613 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 3.d, the $419 debt alleged \nin SOR \u00b6 3.e, and the $147 medical debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 3.g. He has been paying $66 \nper month on the SOR \u00b6 3.c debt since March 2019, and he has reduced the balance \nfrom $4,798 to $1,801. Those four debts are mitigated. \nApplicant has been unemployed since he was laid off in May 2022. He stated \nthat he does contract work, and he had periods between contracts when he was unable \nto pay his debts. Applicant\u2019s unemployment factors into his financial problems, but his \ncriminal conduct, probation, and restitution also played a part. In about July 2021, when \nhe still had multiple delinquent debts, he bought a new vehicle financed with an auto \nloan of about $56,800, with monthly payments of $961 for 75 months. He has done \nnothing to resolve the $6,477 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 3.a, and he presented no evidence \nto indicate that he plans to pay the debt. \nThere is insufficient evidence for a determination that Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems will be resolved within a reasonable period. I am unable to find that he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances or that he made a good-faith effort to pay the \n$6,477 debt. The intentional financial breach of trust is not mitigated under the same \nrationale discussed under the criminal conduct guideline. Applicant\u2019s financial issues \nare recent and ongoing. They continue to cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. None of the mitigating conditions are sufficient to \nfully mitigate financial considerations security concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.

In Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, she admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.g, 1.i-1.x, with explanations, and denied the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.h, 1.y- 1.bb, with explanations.

Department Counsel offered six \nexhibits marked as GE 1 through 6. Applicant testified and offered documents marked as \nApplicant Exhibits (AE) A through G. The record was held open until July 7, 2023, to \npermit Applicant to submit additional documents. She timely submitted AE H through N. I \nsustained Applicant\u2019s objection to GE 5 (unauthenticated summary report of her interview \nwith a government investigator), and there were no other objections to the proffered \nexhibits. GE 1 through 4 and GE 6, and AE A through N are admitted in evidence. DOHA \nreceived the hearing transcript (Tr.) on July 3, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 29 years old. She has been employed by a defense contractor since \nJune 2016 and has worked as a software test engineer since January 2022. She has had \na security clearance since October 2016. She attended college from August 2012 to May \n2016 and earned a bachelor\u2019s degree. She has not been married and has one child, age \nseven. (GE 1; AE G; Tr. 87-88) \nThe SOR alleges 28 delinquent debts totaling $97,643, including 18 student loans \ntotaling $89,011. In Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, she admitted the allegations in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.g, 1.i-1.x, with explanations, and denied the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.h, 1.y-\n1.bb, with explanations. Her admissions are accepted as findings of fact. \nApplicant attributes her financial problems to an abusive former fianc\u00e9 and his \nfailure to pay child support and her attorney fees, his underemployment and \nunemployment, her child support costs, and her lack of education and experience with \ncredit. Applicant testified that she separated from her abusive former fianc\u00e9 in May 2019 \nand hired an attorney in March 2020 to obtain child support, incurring legal fees of \n$14,000. She provided documentary evidence that her former fianc\u00e9 engaged in domestic \nviolence against her, that in June 2021 a state court ordered him to pay child support of \n$656 per month plus $200 per month towards child support arrearages of $19,392, that \nin May 2023 he requested to reduce his monthly child support obligation because he lost \na job and was earning about 40% of his previous wages, and that a hearing was \nscheduled for August 2023 to consider his request. (Answer; GE 1; AE G; Tr. 46-51) \nApplicant admitted that she had limited education and experience with credit. After \nbeing asked detailed financial questions by a government investigator during the security \nclearance investigation, she realized that she needed to better understand her financial \nsituation and started to act on her delinquent accounts. During the hearing, Applicant still \ndid not appear to fully comprehend the scope of her financial problems. She was informed \nof the importance of submitting documentary evidence of debt payments, efforts to \ncontact creditors or to resolve or otherwise address delinquent debts.

(Answer) Credit reports from May \n2021, November 2021 and June 2023 show the account as in collection for $318. \nApplicant provided evidence that she paid the creditor $318 in July 2021. (GE 2 at 2, GE \n3 at 5, GE 6 at 1-2, GE 4 at 9) I find for Applicant on this allegation. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.f, 1.j-1.m: student loans charged off for $7,831; $7,019; $8,316; \n$8,317; $10,437; $6,133; $6,986; $5,984; $5,946 totaling $66,969. Applicant admitted \neach allegation and explained that these student loan accounts had been consolidated \nwith a monthly payment of about $212. (Answer at 3-4) A May 2021 credit report shows \nthe SOR accounts were joint account student loans from a private lender opened from \nJune 2012 to August 2015 and were 90 to 120 days past due. (GE 3 at 8, 9, 12-14) A \nNovember 2021 credit report reflects the accounts were charged off in the amounts \nalleged. (GE 2 at 4-5, 7-8) A June 2023 credit report shows the balance of each charged-\noff account increased from November 2021 to June 2023 as follows: $7,831 to $9,025; \n$7,019 to $8,300; $8,316 to $9,733; $8,317 to $9,735; $10,437 to $12,259; $6,133 to \n$7,215; $6,986 to $8,218; $5,984 to $6,970; and $5,946 to $6,906. (GE 6 at 8-12) \nApplicant testified that she started making payments on these loans in 2017 and \nacknowledged missing some payments. She said that she contacted the lender in 2020 \nor 2021 and after providing requested information, the lender specified a payment which \nis withdrawn from her bank account monthly. She said that she was current on the \naccount and making payments under a payment plan. She submitted an extract from a \nJune 2023 credit report showing a student loan account \u201cin good standing\u201d and with a \nbalance of $1,103, but with no other account information. After the hearing, she provided \nevidence showing payments from February 2017 to June 2023 on an account with the \nsame lender but not alleged in the SOR. That account was opened in October 2014 in \nthe amount of $1,000, reported as current in credit reports, and with balance of $1,089 in \nJune 2023. (Tr. 52-65, 63, 90, 100-101; AE K; GE 3 at 14, GE 2 at 7, GE 6 at 9) \nAfter the hearing, Applicant also submitted bank records showing payments to the \ncreditor in February, June and July 2017 (about $150 each); September 2017 ($330); \nDecember 2017 through June 2019 (about $288 per month); August 2019 ($153); \nNovember 2019 ($288); March 2020 ($627), and August 2020 ($1,419). Her bank records \nfrom March 2018 through June 2019 included loan account numbers and show payments \non seven accounts alleged in the SOR. The bank records also show payments on two \naccounts with the same lender, but not alleged in the SOR. One of the non-SOR accounts \nis the student loan shown as current and discussed above. The other non-SOR student \nloan was opened in June 2016, shown as charged-off in a June 2023 credit report, and \nwith a balance of $1,704. (AE K, N; GE 3 at 14, GE 2 at 6; GE 6 at 7) Applicant provided \nno documentary evidence of a payment agreement for the delinquent student loans \nalleged in the SOR, or of payment on those loans since at least August 2020. \nSOR \u00b6 1.g: credit account placed for collection of $729.

(Answer; GE 3 at 5, \nGE 2 at 5, GE 6 at 4; AE B, AE M; Tr. 74, 97-98) This debt is being resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.h: credit account placed for collection of $3,654. Applicant denied the \nallegation. (Answer) Credit reports from May and November 2021 show the account was \nopened in June 2019, and in collection for $3,654. A June 2023 credit report shows the \naccount as in collection for $3,599. Applicant testified that she contacted the creditor a \nfew months before the hearing when she could afford to address this debt. She said that \nshe had made one payment under the agreement and intended to make future payments. \nShe provided evidence of a payment plan that required 66 monthly payments of $55, and \nthat she made the first required payment in June 2023 reducing the account balance to \n$3,598. (GE 3 at 2, GE 2 at 6, GE 6 at 4; AE C; Tr. 74-77, 98-99) \nSOR \u00b6 1.i: credit account placed for collection of $392. Applicant admitted the \nallegation and said that she was working to pay it. (Answer) Credit reports from May 2021, \nNovember 2021, and June 2023 show the account as opened or assigned in July 2019, \nand as in collection for $392. (GE 3 at 5, GE 2 at 6, GE 6 at 4) She testified that she \ncontacted the creditor a few months before the hearing when she could afford to address \nthis debt and the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h. She mistakenly believed she had negotiated \na single payment plan for both debts. After the hearing she submitted evidence of a \npayment agreement with the creditor requiring monthly payments from July 2023 until \nSeptember 2023 to resolve this debt. (AE J; Tr. 74-77) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.n-1.u: student loans placed for collection including $3,171; $1,552; \n$2,426; $1,471; $3,894; $1,932; $1,561; and $3,851 totaling $19,858. Applicant \nadmitted each allegation and said that she was working with the U.S. Department of \nEducation (DoED) to identify a monthly payment. (Answer at 4) Credit reports from May \nand November 2021 show the loans were individual accounts, opened from September \n2012 to August 2015, and that each account was assigned to the Government for \ncollection in the amounts alleged. A June 2023 Credit report shows the accounts with \nbalances alleged in the SOR but no past due balance. Applicant submitted an extract \nfrom a June 2023 credit report showing nine DoED student loans including eight in the \namounts alleged in the SOR as \u201cIn good standing.\u201d Applicant testified that these loans \nwere reflected as in good standing because of COVID federal student loan relief and her \nefforts to consolidate them. (GE 2 at 8-11, GE 3 at 2-4, GE 6 at 5-7; AE D; Tr. 99-100) \nApplicant reported and testified that she was not aware of the federal student loans \nuntil about May 2018, when her federal income tax refund was withheld. She said some \npayments were made on these loans through garnishment of her wages starting in 2019, \nand with funds withheld from her federal income tax refunds from 2018 until COVID. She \ndid not take any action after learning about these loans or try to determine how much she \nowed because she thought that \u201cwas how the payment process was going to be\u201d and \nbecause she did not then understand how much financial considerations could affect her. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAfter the hearing, she submitted evidence of payments totaling about $13,600 from \nNovember 2018 to April 2020 including treasury offsets totaling $7,652.

She \ninitially earned about $51,000 annually and by 2021 her salary increased to about \n$66,000. In January 2022, she was promoted to her current position and earns about \n$82,000 annually. She receives child support payments of about $760 monthly, but not \nconsistently. She had not received child support payments from March 2023 until the \nhearing because her child\u2019s father lost his job and was seeking to decrease his child \nsupport payments because of financial hardship. She reported a remainder of about \n$1,100 after monthly expenses. She said that that she maintains a written budget and \nwould submit a copy but did not do so. She reported about $4,200 in her bank accounts \nand estimated her retirement account balance at more than $50,000. (Answer; Tr. 53-55, \n80-87, 94-97, 102-103; AE G) \nApplicant submitted an email and letter stating that she was actively seeking the \nguidance and assistance of a named and qualified financial advisor employed by her \ncredit union. She said that she was committed to working with the advisor to implement \neffective strategies and achieve financial stability. (Tr. 72-73, 93-94; AE H, I) \nApplicant submitted letters of recommendation and emails from colleagues and \nfriends that favorably commented on her parenting skills, loyalty, work ethic and \nperformance, professionalism, demeanor, compliance with rules, character, and \nsuitability for a security clearance. (AE F) \nPolicies \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not inflexible \nrules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines \nare applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n\u201cThe applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, \nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department \nCounsel, and has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance \ndecision.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue h[er] security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988); see AG \u00b6 2(b). \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. Under AG \n\u00b6 2(b), any doubt \u201cwill be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be \na determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified or sensitive information to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout a person\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nclassified or sensitive information. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified or \nsensitive information. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and record evidence including credit reports and \ndocumentary evidence submitted by Applicant establish two disqualifying conditions \nunder this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d) and AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of \nnot meeting financial obligations\u201d). The following mitigating conditions are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control, and   \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are numerous, ongoing, \nand not incurred under circumstances making recurrence unlikely. Her delinquent debts \nand behavior cast doubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not fully established. Applicant\u2019s former fianc\u00e9\u2019s violence against her, \nhis failure to provide child support and her associated litigation costs, his unemployment \nand underemployment were largely beyond her control. However, she has not provided \nsufficient evidence that she acted responsibly under the circumstances. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is not fully established. Applicant is actively working with a qualified \nfinancial advisor but has not submitted sufficient evidence that her financial problems are \nbeing resolved or are under control. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is established for the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.g, 1.v-1.w, and \n1.y-1.bb because Applicant has either paid the debts or negotiated payment agreements \nwith the creditors and established a meaningful record of payments in compliance with \nthose agreements.

She provided no documentary evidence to support claims that her nine \nstudent loans from a private lender (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.f, 1.j-1.m) have been consolidated or \nthat she has continued to make payments on these loans. The evidence shows some \npayments on these loans until about August 2020 but no payments since, and that the \nstudent loans were charged off no later than November 2021. As of June 2023, the \nbalance due on these student loans increased by more than $11,000 to $78,361, and, \nthough not alleged in the SOR, one additional student loan ($1,704 balance) with this \ncreditor has recently been charged off. \nApplicant said she first learned of her federal student loan debt (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.n-1.u) \nin about May 2018 but took no affirmative steps to contact the creditor, voluntarily pay, or \notherwise resolve these debts until February 2023 when she applied to consolidate the \nloans and applied for an income-based repayment plan. Involuntary payroll deductions \nand tax refund interception resulted in payments totaling about $13,600 from November \n2018 to April 2020 and reduced the principal balance from $30,319 to $21,682. However, \ninvoluntary payments are not the equivalent of good-faith payments. See ISCR Case No. \n17-04110 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 26, 2019). Applicant\u2019s involuntary payments and recent \nefforts to address these student loans are insufficient to fully mitigate security concerns. \nAlthough it appears that Applicant\u2019s student loan from her school (SOR \u00b6 1.x) is in \nforbearance and has been placed with a federal loan servicer at her request, her recent \nefforts are insufficient to mitigate security concerns attributable to her admitted failure to \nmake a payment on this student loan since 2016. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). I considered Applicant\u2019s age, education, \nemployment history, character evidence, debt resolution efforts, and that her financial \nproblems were caused, in part, by circumstances beyond her control. Applicant was \ncandid and sincere at the hearing but has not demonstrated the judgment or financial \nresponsibility expected of persons entrusted with access to classified information. It \nappears that she now better understands the security implications of delinquent debt and \nthe importance of addressing her financial problems. However, she has not provided \nsufficient evidence that she \u201cact[ed] responsibly given h[er] circumstances [or] \ndevelop[ed] a reasonable plan for repayment, accompanied by \u2018concomitant conduct,\u2019 \nthat is, actions which evidence a serious intent to effectuate the plan.\u201d ISCR Case No. \n15-02903 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 9, 2017). See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 13-00987 at 3, n. 5 \n(App. Bd. Aug. 14, 2014). \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nnot mitigated the security concerns raised by her delinquent debts at this time. \nThis decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or \nwill not attain the level of financial responsibility necessary to be eligible for a security \nclearance. In the future and with more effort towards establishing a meaningful track \nrecord of financial responsibility, she may well be able to demonstrate persuasive \nevidence of her security clearance worthiness. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1.g, 1.v-1.w, \n1.y-1.bb: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b-1.f, 1.h-1.u, 1.x: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nEric C. Price \nAdministrative Judge \n10 \n",

(Item 4) The non-authenticated nature of the subject interview raises the issue \nof whether it is admissible under Directive \u00b6 E.3.20. In the FORM, Department Counsel \ninformed Applicant of his right to object to the admissibility of the summary, as non-\nauthenticated, or alternatively, of his opportunity to make any corrections, additions, \ndeletions, or updates. Applicant did not do so. Consequently, I have incorporated the \nsummary of the subject interview into the record for consideration. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 32-year old married man. He is a U.S. Army veteran, serving from \n2011 to 2019. He was honorably discharged. (Item 3 at 17) He has a high school diploma \nand has taken some college courses. (Item 3 at 12) Since December 2020, he has worked \nfor a defense contractor as a warehouse technician, and he has held a Secret clearance \nsince August 2017. (Item 3 at 13) \nIn or about March 2019, while in the Army, Applicant used marijuana. He held a \nsecurity clearance at the time. His marijuana use led to the failure of a random urinalysis \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ntest.

(Item 1 at 3)  During \na follow-up interview, Applicant admitted using marijuana on several occasions. (Item 6 at \n2) He stated that he learned his lesson and does not intend to use marijuana again. (Item 2 \nat 4)  \nApplicant failed to disclose his use of marijuana and his non-judicial punishment for \nfailing a drug test, as required on his security clearance application of January 2021. In his \ninterview with an investigative agent, he said that he failed to disclose the required \ninformation because he forgot to include it. (GE 2 at 4) In his answer, he stated that he \n\u201cmay have mistakenly selected the wrong button,\u201d when completing the security clearance \napplication.\u201d (Item 1 at 2) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing\nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484\nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance,\nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief\nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially\ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines\nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior,\nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative\nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and\ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious\nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative\njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present,\nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 1(d) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . ..\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the totality \nof an applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). They are as follows: \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; \n(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation;  \n(3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;  \n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;  \n(5) the extent to which participation is voluntary;  \n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges;  \n(7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and  \n(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nAnalysis \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nUnder this concern, \u201cconduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, \ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive \ninformation.\u201d (AG \u00b6 15) Moreover, of \u201cspecial concern is any failure to cooperate or provide \ntruthful and candid answers during national security investigative or adjudicative \nprocesses.\u201d (Id.) Applicant\u2019s omissions from his security clearance application raise the \nissue of whether AG \u00b6 16(a), \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form \nused to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or \nstatus, determine national security eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary \nresponsibilities,\u201d applies. Applicant\u2019s conflicting explanations for the omissions fatally \nundercut his credibility. Under these circumstances AG \u00b6 16(a) applies without mitigation. \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement \nUnder this concern, \u201cillegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances that cause \nphysical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their intended \npurpose can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both \nbecause such behavior may lead to physical or psychological impairment, and because it \nraises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations.\u201d (AG \u00b6 24) Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana and his subsequent failure of a drug \ntest triggers the application of AG \u00b6 25(a),\u201dany substance misuse,\u201d and AG \u00b6 25(b), \u201ctesting \npositive for an illegal drug.\u201d \nAlthough Applicant used marijuana while holding a security clearance, there is no \nrecord evidence that he had been granted access to classified information when he used it. \nConsequently, AG \u00b6 25(f), \u201cany illegal drug use while granted access to classified \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n_____________________ \ninformation or holding a sensitive position,\u201d does not apply. (See ISCR Case No.20-03111 \nat 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, 2022) Nevertheless, such use is particularly egregious because \napplicants, having previously been granted clearances are fully cognizant of the security \nsignificance of holding a clearance. (ISCR Case No. 06-18270 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 7, \n2007)) \nGiven Applicant\u2019s security clearance application falsifications, his assertion that he \nwill not use marijuana in the future has minimal probative value. I conclude that none of the \nmitigating conditions applies, and that Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana which led to the drug \ntest failure continues to pose a security clearance concern. \nWhole-Person Concept \nI have considered the whole-person factors in my analysis of the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions, and conclude that they do not warrant a favorable conclusion. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.c:  \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a \u2013 2.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

He lives remotely for \nmonths at a time wherever his job site is located. When he is not working at a jobsite, he \nlives in his wife\u2019s home with their child and his stepchild in Mexico. He is paid a per diem \nof about $1,500 per month to cover his living expenses when he is working remotely. He \nhas no mortgage and pays no rent. When he is working out of his employer\u2019s offices in \nthe United States, he lives at his brother\u2019s house during the week and with his wife on \nweekends. He has about $600 in savings. He is learning how to manage his money. He \nclaims he is \u201cvery wise\u201d with his money and is \u201cconsistently\u201d paying off his debts. He is \ntrying to rebuild his credit score. (Tr. at 21-26; 34-36, 61-63.) \nThe current status of the debts listed in the SOR is as follows: \n1.a through 1.d and 1.i through 1.k. Federal Student Loan Collection Debts\nin the Amounts of $23,595, $18,611, $14,441, 14,441, $10,500, $13,312, and $13,31, \nrespectively. Applicant testified that he is currently paying these debts. He pays $188 \nper month on all of his student loans. I note that Federal student loans have been in \nforbearance under the COVID-19 moratorium since March 2020. Applicant has been \npaying his loans notwithstanding the forbearance. (Tr. at 26-27, 29, 33, 63-68; GE 3 at 8-\n9; GE 4 at 2-3; GE 5 at 3, 4, 5, 6; and GE 11 at 4, 5.) \n \nApplicant provided after the hearing detailed statements from one of the \nGovernment\u2019s student loan service companies. It appears from these statements that ten \nof Applicant\u2019s student loans have been consolidated and are being paid every month from \nApplicant\u2019s monthly payments of about $184. The statement marked as AE G also reflects \nthat Applicant\u2019s monthly payments began February 2022. The statements marked as AE \nH reflect that all ten of the loans are Federal Subsidized and Unsubsidized Stafford Loans \nand that the payments are solely being applied to interest accruing on the loans. These \ndocuments support Applicant\u2019s claim that all of the student loans alleged in the SOR are \nbeing paid every month with his single payment. These debts are in the initial stage of \nbeing resolved. (AE G; AE H.) \n1.e. Charged-Off Credit-Card Debt in the Amount of $464. Applicant credibly \ntestified that he paid this debt, though he is uncertain when it was paid. The debt is listed \nin the February 2021 credit report in the record, but not in any of the more recent credit \nreports. This debt is resolved. (Tr. at 27, 65; and GE 5 at 4.) \n1.f through 1.h. Medical Debts in Collection in the Amounts of $148, $109,\nand $108, respectively. Applicant testified that he mistakenly denied these debts in his \nAnswer.

The vehicle was stolen in Mexico when he took \nthe car there in about 2014. His insurance company declined coverage for the loss since \nthe loss occurred outside the United States and was not covered by his U.S. insurance \npolicy. Applicant has not repaid the loan and believes it may have dropped off his credit \nreport due to age. He understands that he still owes this debt, but he does not know how \nto approach the creditor or whatever company owns the debt at this time. He asserted \nthat he is \u201copen\u201d to paying off the loan because he wants to pay off every debt he is \n\u201ccapable\u201d of paying. This debt is not yet resolved, but Applicant intends to pay it when he \nis able to do so. (Tr. at 29, 45, 68-70; and GE 5 at 7.) \nApplicant also admitted at the hearing that he has not yet filed his 2021 Federal \nincome tax returns. He claimed he lost the paperwork he needed to file his return. He \nplans to file this tax return when he submits his 2022 return. Applicant was questioned at \nthe hearing about an unpaid personal loan that was referred to collection in the amount \nof $3,209. The debt appeared in the Government\u2019s January 20, 2023 credit report (GE \n11). He took out the loan during a period of unemployment in 2021 and then was unable \nto repay it. He paid the debt shortly before the hearing. Neither the un-filed tax return nor \nthe recent paid collection debt is alleged in the SOR. (Tr. at 49-50, 58-60.) \nParagraph 2 - Guideline J, Criminal Conduct \nThe Government alleged that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because of his \ncriminal conduct, which raises questions about his judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness; and about his ability and willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations. In his Answer Applicant admitted that he plead guilty to criminal charges \nduring the period 2006 through 2014. The specifics of the charges and guilty pleas are \nas follows: \n2.a. Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol (DUI) in 2006. Applicant was\narrested in 2006 and charged with DUI and DUI .08% BAC or more. He plead no contest \nin 2007 to DUI 0.08% BAC or more and was sentenced to five years of probation and \nfined. This DUI charge arose out of a bar fight in which Applicant was involved with a \nnumber of other individuals. He was intoxicated at the time. He drove away from the bar \nto flee the others involved and had a serious accident. He has experienced multiple \nsurgeries since that have caused him to experience periods of disability and \nunemployment. Starting in 2017 he has been healthy enough to work full time. (Tr. at 22-\n23, 37, 51-52; GE 1 at Section 22; GE 8.) \n \n2.b. False Imprisonment and Battery of Spouse in 2010. Applicant was arrested \nin 2010 and charged with False Imprisonment and Battery of Spouse. He plead guilty to \nBattery of Spouse and was sentenced to five days in jail and three years of probation. He \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nwas on probation at the time due to his 2006 sentence for DUI .08% BAC or more, as \nnoted above. The incident that gave rise to Applicant\u2019s arrest in 2010 came at a time when \nhis first marriage was ending. His then-wife accused Applicant of picking her up by her \nneck and throwing her against the wall. He denied the allegation at his security clearance \nhearing stating that he was recovering from back surgery three or four weeks earlier and \ncould not physically have done what he was accused of doing. He also testified that he \npled guilty to avoid a six-month jail sentence. The reduced sentence \u201cplayed a major role\u201d \nin his decision to plead guilty to the charge of Battery of Spouse. He conceded that he \nlied to the criminal court judge by pleading guilty and admitting the offense, which he now \ndenies committing. He further explained that he was experiencing a lot of pain from a \nrecent surgery and was not \u201cthinking straight\u201d at the time of his guilty plea. (Tr. at 37-39, \n52-56, 77-78; GE 1 at Section 22; and GE 6 at 5-6.) \n2.c. DUI and DUI within Ten Years of Prior DUI Conviction. In 2014 Applicant \nwas arrested again for DUI. He pled guilty to DUI within Ten Years of Prior DUI Conviction. \nHe was sentenced to five years of probation and fined. This incident occurred after \nApplicant lost custody of his children. A consequence of his conviction on that charge was \nthat Applicant\u2019s license was suspended for a period. He has never sought to have his \nlicense reinstated. He does not currently have a driver\u2019s license. He takes public \ntransportation instead. (Tr. at 40-42, 56-57; GE 1 at Section 22; and GE 6 at 7; GE 7.) \nMitigation \nApplicant is trying to become financially stable and pay his debts that arose during \nhis disability. He has provided a list of his assets and liabilities. His assets include about \n$4,000 of investments in certificates of deposits. His liabilities include a car loan on a \nvehicle he purchased for his wife in Mexico. He also provided evidence of an investment \nportfolio with a value of about $3,200. In addition, he provided evidence of a whole-life \ninsurance policy in the face amount of $100,000 that he purchased in November 2022. \nWith respect to his unfiled Federal tax return for tax year 2021, he provided an IRS Wage \nand Tax Statement for 2021 that provides him with the necessary information to file his \nreturn, though the return will be filed late. (AE C through F.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 - Guideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personal security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAG \u00b6 19 describes two conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nAs of the date the SOR was issued, Applicant owed approximately $120,000 for \n12 delinquent debts, including $106,000 in past-due student loans. These facts render \nthe foregoing disqualifying conditions applicable and shift the burden to Applicant to \nmitigate those concerns. \nThe guideline includes three conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s alleged financial difficulties: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant\u2019s debts arose under the unusual circumstances of his car accident in \n2006 that left him disabled and unable to work for many years. He had insufficient income \nto begin to repay his student loans. The loss of his vehicle in a car theft in Mexico in 2014 \nthat was not covered by Applicant\u2019s U.S. insurance policy also occurred under highly \nunusual circumstances. With his disability and lack of employment income, he was forced \nto divert his car payments to other priorities. Overall, Applicant\u2019s behavior does not cast \ndoubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) is \nestablished. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe condition that caused Applicant\u2019s financial problems was that he was disabled, \nhad multiple surgeries, and was unable to earn a living for a long period of time. However, \nhis disability arose from circumstances that were entirely within his control. While \nintoxicated in a bar, he became the subject of a bar fight pitting him against a number of \nother occupants of the bar. He escaped the bar and drove off. He had an accident and \nwas injured. The injuries resulted in his disability. He was charged and convicted of DUI. \nApplicant bears sole responsibility for his accident. Nevertheless, he has acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances by beginning to repay his large student loan debt \nand paying off other debts once he was financially able to do so. He must still pay the \nauto loan, but he has every intention to do so. AG \u00b6 20(b) partially applies. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is established. He has initiated a good-faith effort to repay his over-due \ncreditors and has repaid four of them. He has begun to repay his student loans about one \nyear ago. He has not yet developed a plan to repay his debt on the vehicle loan, but he \ncredibly stated that he intends to repay all of his debts from his past, including that debt. \nOverall, Applicant has met his burden to mitigate security concerns under \nGuideline F, financial considerations. He has acted responsibly within his available means \nsince beginning to work again to repay his debts following a disabling incident that \nresulted in years of limited income. Paragraph 1 is found for Applicant. \nParagraph 2 \u2013 Guideline J, Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 30 as follows: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes two conditions that raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted; and \n(d) violation or revocation of parole or probation, or failure to complete a \ncourt-mandated rehabilitation program. \nApplicant was convicted of three crimes during the period 2006 through 2014. One \nof the crimes occurred while he was on probation for a prior conviction. This evidence \nshifts the burden to Applicant to establish mitigation. \nAG \u00b6 32 sets forth four mitigating conditions under Guideline J. The following three \nmitigating conditions have possible application to the facts in this case: \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the offense; \nand \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to, \nthe passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, good employment record, or constructive community involvement. \nAG \u00b6 32 (c) has not been established. At the hearing, Applicant denied that he \nabused his first wife prior to his arrest in 2010. The fact that he pled guilty to Battery of \nSpouse undercuts his testimony that he was innocent of that charge. Also, the police \nfound the complainant\u2019s statements credible and determined that there was probable \ncause to arrest Applicant and charge him with Battery of Spouse. The record contains \nreliable evidence to support that Applicant committed the offense. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 32 (a) and (d) have been fully established. So much time has passed since \nthe 2014 DUI conviction without any recurrence8 that additional criminal conduct is \nunlikely. Applicant has relinquished his driver\u2019s license making it highly unlikely that he \nwill drive again, let alone drive while under the influence of alcohol. In the past, there was \nevidence of a pattern of criminal behavior, but Applicant has not engaged in any criminal \nbehavior since 2014. His past criminal behavior does not cast doubt on his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. Moreover, there is evidence of successful \nrehabilitation. Since Applicant has overcome his disability and has been able to return to \nthe workplace, he has worked hard to be successful, to be able to support his family, and \nto pay child support. \nOverall, Applicant has met his burden to mitigate security concerns under \nGuideline J, criminal conduct. Paragraph 2 is found for Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for national security eligibility by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence  . \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI have considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nall pertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Further comments are \nwarranted. Applicant\u2019s finances suffered a large blow when he became disabled. Over \nthe years, he has worked to recover his health sufficiently to be able to return to a job, \nearn a living, and regain the self-respect of being able to support himself and his new \nfamily. His work requires significant hardships in that he works remotely for months at a \ntime and away from his family. He is seeking to restore his financial health as well by \npaying his debts, saving money, and purchasing life insurance to protect his family\u2019s \nfuture. His testimony about his intentions to repay all of his debts was sincere and \ncredible. His past criminal conduct is unlikely to be repeated. The many years that have \npassed since his most recent arrest without any incidents involving law enforcement \nsupports that conclusion. Overall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or \ndoubts as to Applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility and a security clearance \nat this time. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.l: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a though 2.c: \nFor Applicant \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                  \n \n               \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national security \neligibility for a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and the Government\u2019s exhibits, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 48 years old and has been married since August 2003. He has four adult children and one adult stepchild. His three oldest children are from previous relationships. None of those three children live with him. He was awarded his GED in 1992 or 1993 and has some college credits. He reported recent periods of unemployment from May to July 2018 and from March to July 2020. Since July 2020, he has been employed by a defense contractor. (Items 2 and 3.) Under Guideline F, the SOR alleged that Applicant has: (1) two child support accounts in collection totaling $30,910 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and e); (2) four federal student loans in collection totaling $19,273 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, d, f, and g); (3) three delinquent consumer accounts totaling $4,322 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b,h, and n), and (4) eight medical accounts in collection totaling $3,857 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i \u2013 m, o - q). The SOR debts total $58,362. (Item 1S.) Applicant denied the two child support allegations ($30,910). He admitted the four student loan allegations ($19,273).

On April 11, 2023, Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s File of \nRelevant Material (FORM), including documents identified as Items 1 through 5. On April \n12, 2023, the FORM was mailed to Applicant. Applicant received the FORM on May 1, \n2023. He was afforded an opportunity to note objections and to submit material in \nrefutation, extenuation, or mitigation, and was given 30 days from receipt of the FORM to \ndo so. He submitted no response. Government Items 1A and 1S, the SOR and the \nAnswer, respectively, are the pleadings in the case. Items 2 through 5 are admitted \nwithout objection. The case was assigned to me on August 8, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nAfter a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and the Government\u2019s \nexhibits, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 48 years old and has been married since August 2003. He has four \nadult children and one adult stepchild. His three oldest children are from previous \nrelationships. None of those three children live with him. He was awarded his GED in \n1992 or 1993 and has some college credits. He reported recent periods of unemployment \nfrom May to July 2018 and from March to July 2020. Since July 2020, he has been \nemployed by a defense contractor. (Items 2 and 3.) \nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleged that Applicant has: (1) two child support \naccounts in collection totaling $30,910 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and e); (2) four federal student loans \nin collection totaling $19,273 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, d, f, and g); (3) three delinquent consumer \naccounts totaling $4,322 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b,h, and n), and (4) eight medical accounts in \ncollection totaling $3,857 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i \u2013 m, o - q). The SOR debts total $58,362. (Item \n1S.) \nApplicant denied the two child support allegations ($30,910). He admitted the four \nstudent loan allegations ($19,273). He denied one consumer account allegation ($684) \nand admitted the other two allegations ($3,638). He denied the first six medical account \nallegations ($3,683) and admitted the last two ($175). (Item 1A.) \nDuring his November 2, 2020 personal subject interview (PSI), Applicant \ndiscussed the child support allegations he denied. They were based on two court orders \nfor back child support. The three children he fathered outside of his marriage applied for \nwelfare and gave the child support agency his name as their father. The agency imposed \na garnishment of his wages. He could not recall when garnishment was imposed, but his \nwages are still being garnished. He plans to find out the status of those accounts but has \nno reason to disagree with the information reported. He did not provide documents \nshowing the current garnishment.

The $12,490 child \nsupport account is not reported. (Item 5.) On the November 9, 2021 credit report, the \n$12,490 account was opened in August 1995; the last payment ($856) and the first major \ndelinquency were in October 2021. The $18,420 account is not reported. The children are \nnow 28, 29, and 31 years old. (Items 2 and 4.) \nDuring his PSI, Applicant also discussed the medical account delinquencies he \ndenied. He was aware that some of his medical bills went into collections. He has a \nmedical condition that requires frequent medical care. Due to periods of unemployment \nand other bills to pay, he got behind on paying medical bills. In addition, his medical \ninsurance did not always pay its portion of the bills timely. Also, he was not always being \nnotified of all his bills. (Item 3.) His explanation about unemployment playing a role in his \nmedical bill delinquencies is consistent with the record. Seven of his eight medical \naccount delinquencies were assigned to collection just before, during, or just after his \n2018 and 2020 periods of unemployment. (Items 4 and 5.) \nDuring his PSI, Applicant discussed his federal student loans. He did not list them, \nbecause the school he attended, ITT Technical Institute (ITT), was found to have been \noperating unethically causing students to accumulate excessive debt. The school was \neventually shut down, and he never received a degree. On August 16, 2022, the U.S. \nDepartment of Education announced a $3.9 billion group discharge for 208,000 borrowers \nwho attended ITT between January 1, 2005, and its closure in September 2016. The \nDepartment found that ITT: \u201c[I]ntentionally misled students about the quality of their \nprograms in order to profit off federal student loan programs with no regard for the \nhardship this would cause . . . These borrowers will have the federal student loans they \nreceived to attend ITT discharged without any additional action on their part.\u201d \nhttps://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/education-department-approves-39-billion-\ngroup-discharge-208000-borrowers-who-attended-itt-technical-institute \nThe credit reports show that Applicant\u2019s federal student loans were opened \nbetween November 2010 and April 2013. (Items 4 and 5,) They are, therefore, covered \nby the Government\u2019s discharge of ITT student loans. \nThe Government\u2019s credit reports support the three consumer debts ($4,322) (SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.b, h, and n). (Items 4 and 5.) \nLaw and Policies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court has noted, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines, which \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nare flexible rules of law, apply together with common sense and the general factors of the \nwhole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all available and reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security decision. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F Financial \u2013 Considerations \nThe security concern relating to Guideline F for financial considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, \nmental health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or \ndependence. An individual who is financially overextended is at greater \nrisk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to \ngenerate funds. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nGuideline F notes conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 19. \nThe followings conditions are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nThe SOR debts are established by Applicant's admissions and the \nGovernment's credit reports. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and (c) apply. \nGuideline F also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. I have reviewed the seven mitigating conditions \nunder AG \u00b6 2. The following is the only one potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment. \nThe child support debts apparently had their origins in 1995. That is quite a \nlong time ago. They have, however, persisted. Applicant\u2019s payment ($856) and the first \nmajor delinquency were as recent as October 2021. And those debts are still in collection. \nThus, they are still being tracked by credit reporting agencies. The magnitude and \nrecency of those debts preclude the application of AG \u00b6 20(a). I find against Applicant on \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 20 1.a and e. \nThe Appeal Board has cited with approval the Government\u2019s discharge of ITT\u2019s \nstudent loan debts. ISCR Case No. 22-01667 at 2 (App. Bd. May 16, 2023), citing ISCR \nCase No. 21-01688 (App. Bd. Jan. 30, 2023). Applicant\u2019s federal student loans have been \ndischarged by the Government, because they relate to ITT. I find in his favor on SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.c, d, f, and g. \nApplicant admitted two of the three consumer debt allegations. He has not \nmitigated the third, which he denied. That last debt is supported by the Government\u2019s \ncredit reports. I find against Applicant on SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, h, and n. \nApplicant\u2019s medical debts totaling $3,857 present a different issue. I have given \nlittle weight to the eight medical collection accounts that remain unresolved. Medical debt \nis unlike other types of debt. First, it is presumed that medical debt is incurred for \nnecessary medical care and treatment as opposed to frivolous and irresponsible spending \nor otherwise living beyond one\u2019s means. Second, medical debt is usually unplanned, \nunexpected, and nondiscretionary. Third, it can add hundreds if not thousands of dollars \nin debt in a short period, which can be overwhelming for a debtor. Finally, Applicant\u2019s \nmedical debts were incurred during two of his periods of unemployment. And his medical \ninsurer was untimely in paying its share of the frequent medical costs required to treat his \nmedical condition. In my view, having less than $5,000 in unresolved medical collection \naccounts does not undermine his suitability, unlike his other unresolved debts. \nAccordingly, I find in favor of Applicant on (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i \u2013 m, o - q). \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and (d)(1)-(9) \n(explaining the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept and factors). In my analysis above, I considered \nthe potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions and the whole-person concept in \nlight of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. \nApplicant leaves me with questions about his eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. Therefore, I conclude that Applicant has not provided sufficient evidence to \nmitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F, financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST  APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1. e: \n(Child Support) \n Against Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c, d, f, and g: \n(Student Loans)\nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.b, h, and n: \n(Consumer Accounts) \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.i \u2013 m, o \u2013 q: \n(Medical Accounts) \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant access to classified information.

She admitted all the criminal conduct allegations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a-2.g) and admitted the cross-allegation under Guideline G (SOR \u00b6 3.a). Her admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is 38 years old. She has never married. She has a nine-year-old daughter. She earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2011. She worked as a bank teller beginning in 2007, initially earning $23,000 annually. She began working as a federal contractor in 2014, with a clearance, and she has had one ever since. She initially earned a $52,000 annual salary, later increased to $60,000. She worked for contractor C from November 2016 to about October 2018. Her salary was reduced to $30,000 from about June to October 2018 due to a change in the job. She worked for another contractor until September 2019, and since then, she has been with her current employer, a federal government contractor. She has worked at the same federal government department since March 2019 and has been in her current job since March 2021. She now earns $85,000 annually.

(Tr. 7-8) A notice scheduling the \nhearing was issued on April 13, 2023. \nThe hearing convened as scheduled. \nDepartment Counsel submitted \nGovernment\u2019s Exhibits (GE) 1 through 12. Government Exhibit 2a, the unauthenticated \nsummaries of Applicant\u2019s 2021 background interviews, was not admitted. (Tr. 22-26) \nThe remaining government exhibits, GE 1, 2b, and 3 through 12, were admitted without \nobjection. Applicant testified but offered no documentary evidence. I held the record \nopen to provide her the opportunity to do so. She timely submitted five documents, \nwhich are marked as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through E and admitted without \nobjection. They include a post-hearing statement (AE A), an updated SOR response \n(AE B), documents showing action on some of her SOR debts (AE C), and two \nreference letters (AE D and AE E). DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on May \n15, 2023, and the record closed on May 16, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b but admitted all other debts alleged (SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.c-1.s). She admitted all the criminal conduct allegations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a-2.g) and \nadmitted the cross-allegation under Guideline G (SOR \u00b6 3.a). Her admissions are \nincorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the \npleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is 38 years old. She has never married. She has a nine-year-old \ndaughter. She earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2011. She worked as a bank teller \nbeginning in 2007, initially earning $23,000 annually. She began working as a federal \ncontractor in 2014, with a clearance, and she has had one ever since. She initially \nearned a $52,000 annual salary, later increased to $60,000. She worked for contractor \nC from November 2016 to about October 2018. Her salary was reduced to $30,000 from \nabout June to October 2018 due to a change in the job. She worked for another \ncontractor until September 2019, and since then, she has been with her current \nemployer, a federal government contractor. She has worked at the same federal \ngovernment department since March 2019 and has been in her current job since March \n2021. She now earns $85,000 annually. (GE 1; Tr. 13, 77-85; AE A) \n2 \n\n \nApplicant listed various delinquent debts on her July 2018 SCA. (GE 1) GE 2a, \nthe summary of her background interviews, was not admitted, but various financial \ndocuments she brought to those interviews are in the record. (GE 2b) \nApplicant testified that she lived at her mother\u2019s house until 2014, when she \npurchased a home. Her mother moved in with her. Four months later, Applicant\u2019s child \nwas born. Prior to that, she was only responsible for a few bills (cell phone and car \nnote). As a new homeowner and single mother, she was responsible for all the \nexpenses of managing a home and caring for a child. (Tr. 38) \nIn August 2018, Applicant was arrested and charged with driving under the \ninfluence of alcohol (DUI). She was pulled over on an interstate highway after she had \nbeen out drinking. She had several mixed drinks. (Tr. 52-53) She pled guilty and \nreceived probation before judgment. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a, 3.a) She also had an ignition \ninterlock device installed, and she said it was voluntary. She also received multiple \ntraffic citations, including driving on a suspended license, driving with suspended \nregistration, negligent driving, speeding, operating a vehicle not in compliance with \ninspection requirements, and failure to display license to uniformed police. (GE 4; Tr. \n114-117) The traffic citations related to this incident were not alleged in the SOR. \nIn December 2019, Applicant\u2019s mother had a severe stroke at age 58, leaving \nApplicant solely responsible for managing the household and caring for her mother and \nchild. Her mother passed away eight months later, in mid-2020. (Tr. 38-39, 122-123; AE \nA) \nIn July 2021, Applicant was arrested and charged with three related counts: \ndriving while impaired by alcohol (DWI), DUI, and DUI while transporting a minor. At the \ntime of the SOR (February 2022), these charges were pending. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b, 2.c, 2.d, \n3.a) This incident also led to traffic offenses or infractions, including driving with a \nsuspended registration (SOR \u00b6 2.e), reckless driving (SOR \u00b6 2.f), and negligent driving \n(SOR \u00b6 2.g). These citations led to fines, of $150, $510, and $240, respectively. (GE 3; \nTr. 34-37, 114-116) \nApplicant reported her July 2021 DUI arrest to her security officer a few days \nlater. She reported that she was driving with her daughter at about 11:30 pm, went off \nthe road, and struck a pole. She reported failing a field sobriety test and that she was \narrested for DUI and other charges. (GE 5; Tr. 114-115) \nApplicant testified that after her first DUI, in 2018, she did not drink and drive. \nThe 2021 DUI arrest occurred about a year after her mother died following her stroke, \nand she was still processing the trauma of those tragic events. Applicant had been at a \nfamily social function and had consumed several mixed drinks between 4 pm and 11 pm \nwhen she left to drive home. She said she \u201chad a lot going on\u201d at the time, but also \nasserted that sleep deprivation was a related cause, and she thinks she fell asleep at \nthe wheel. She did not believe she was intoxicated at the time. She was very \ndisappointed in herself, particularly since she had her daughter in the car. She said the \n3 \n\n \n \naccident was \u201ca shock\u201d to herself and her family and she deeply regrets it. (Tr. 39-42, \n53-54, 118-119) \nIn late January 2022 (days before the SOR was issued), Applicant pled guilty to \nDWI. She received a 60-day suspended jail sentence, and two years of probation. She \nwas also fined $446. (GE 11) Disposition of the two lesser charges (DUI and DUI while \ntransporting a minor) is not indicated but they may have been dismissed as part of the \nguilty plea. Applicant remains on probation until January 2024. (GE 11; Tr. 114-115) \nApplicant asserted that she was told in her plea hearing that she was on \nprobation only for a year, but then was later told it was two years. She was given the \nopportunity to submit post-hearing documentation showing that she was no longer on \nprobation, but she did not submit any such verification. She also explained that she was \nallowed to travel internationally while on probation, and did so, as discussed below. (Tr. \n43-52) She took a six-hour alcohol class as part of her probation requirement. (Tr. 132-\n133) \nApplicant said she is only a social drinker, and she recognizes her \nresponsibilities as a mother, homeowner, and clearance holder. She has had no \nsubsequent arrests or offenses. She no longer drinks to intoxication. (Tr. 42, 54, 117-\n118) \nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleges 19 delinquent debts. This includes about \n$75,000 in past-due federal student loans, and over $21,000 in other delinquencies, \nmostly consumer credit accounts in collection. The debts are established by credit \nreports in the record from December 2021, December 2020, April 2020, December \n2019, and February 2023. (GE 7-10, 12) \nApplicant testified that she is trying to work on paying her debts. She said many \nof them are either paid or being paid. She took a part-time job at a large retailer for a \ntime to earn more money, in about 2017 or 2019. (Tr. 81-82) She does not have anyone \nto help her financially. She is able to maintain her household, feed her child, and care \nfor her pets. She acknowledged not making the best financial decisions and said \nsometimes she will \u201crob Peter to pay Paul.\u201d (Tr. 54-56) Her financial issues began in \n2018 or 2019 with the pay cut noted above. (Tr. 75-76) She is working with a financial \nadvisor to improve her credit. It has taken time to improve her finances and unexpected \nsituations like the COVID pandemic and her mother\u2019s condition and death in 2020 were \nalso factors that impacted her finances (Tr. 56-59) \nThe debts are detailed as follows: \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a ($47,788) and 1.b ($27,545) are federal student loans, alleged as \npast due. Applicant denied both debts. The SOR is based on GE 8, her December 2020 \ncredit report, showing both accounts in collection status, with no activity since \nDecember 2018. (GE 8 at 2; GE 9) \n4 \n\n \nSince March 2020, federal student loans have been in forbearance status by \nPresidential executive order due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Credit reports from \nDecember 2021 and February 2023 show the same amounts listed as alleged but the \naccounts were in \u201cpays as agreed\u201d status, likely for this reason. (GE 7 at 7; GE 12 at 5; \nTr. 60-61, 66-67) \nApplicant took out student loans to finance her college degree, earned in 2011.\nShe believes she had made payments on them in the past but was not certain. She also \nhad private student loans, which she prioritized because there was no way to defer \nthem. She said her private loans have been paid off. She acknowledged that her federal \nstudent loans were delinquent before they were placed in forbearance status due to \nCOVID. The loans may have been delinquent in 2014 when she bought her house. This \nwas due to her limited income and inability to pay. She recognizes that payments will \nsoon be due, and that she will owe between $400 and $600 a month. (Tr. 60-66, 99-\n101) \n \nCongress recently passed a law preventing further extensions of the COVID-\nrelated federal student loan payment pause. The Department of Education recently \nannounced that federal student loan repayments will resume in October 2023. \nhttps://studentaid.gov/announcements-events/covid-19. \nApplicant said that many of her consumer SOR debts are being paid through \nautomatic monthly payments. Some monthly payments are for $250 and others are for \nbetween $25 and $50. (Tr. 67-68, 70-71) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c ($2,224) is a debt placed for collection by a bank. (GE 8) As of \nFebruary 2023, Applicant owed $1,565. (GE 12 at 7) Post-hearing documentation \nshows a debt balance of $1,521. (AE B, AE C) This debt is being paid. \nSOR \u00b6 1.d ($2,213) is a debt placed for collection by the same bank as SOR \u00b6 \n1.c. (GE 8; GE 2b; Tr. 68-70) As of February 2023, Applicant owed $2,186. (GE 12 at 6) \nPost-hearing documentation shows a debt balance of $1,830. (AE B; AE C) The debt is \nbeing paid. \nSOR \u00b6 1.e ($2,083) is an account placed for collection by another bank. (GE 8; \nGE 2b; Tr. 68-70) The debt is not clearly identified on a recent credit report. (GE 12) \nApplicant said post-hearing that she contacted the creditor and was told they had no \nrecord of the debt. She believes it has been satisfied. (AE B) This debt is not resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.f ($1,901) is an account placed for collection by a department store. (GE \n7, 8; GE 2b; Tr 68-69) As of February 2023, Applicant owed $1,310. (GE 12 at 8) Post-\nhearing documentation shows a balance of $1,273. (AE B; AE C) This debt is being \npaid. \nSOR \u00b6 1.g ($1,826) is an account placed for collection by another department \nstore. (GE 8) The account has now been charged off. (GE 12; Tr. 111-112) Applicant \n5 \n\nsaid she made several $228 payments. Her last such payment, $228 on May 2, 2023, \nsatisfied the debt. (AE B; AE C) This debt has been paid. \nSOR \u00b6 1.h ($1,718) is an account placed for collection by Bank S. (GE 6; GE 7; \nGE 8; Tr. 111-112) As of February 2023, Applicant owed $1,093. (GE 12 at 8) The post-\nhearing balance is now $1,042. (AE B; AE C) This debt is being paid. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i ($1,479), 1.j ($1,365), and 1.k ($1,361) are accounts placed for \ncollection with agency M by the same bank, Bank S. (GE 6; GE 7, GE 8; Tr. 110-111) \nThey are all listed as past due as of February 2023. (GE 12 at 6-7) As to SOR \u00b6 1.i, the \naccount balance is now $628. As to SOR \u00b6 1.j, the account balance is now $603. As to \nSOR \u00b6 1.k, the account balance is now $1,061. (AE B; AE C; Tr. 73-74) These debts \nare being paid. \nSOR \u00b6 1.l ($1,246) is a credit account that has been charged off by a furniture \nretailer. (GE 8) Applicant now owes $1,320. (GE 7 at 5; GE 12 at 10) She asserted that \nshe has been making payments but this is undocumented. (Tr. 109-110) She reached \nout to the creditor to determine the debt\u2019s current status but was unsuccessful. (AE B) \nThis debt is not resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.m ($1,287) is a credit account placed for collection by a department \nstore. (GE 7; GE 8) It has now been charged off. (GE 12 at 5) The debt remains unpaid. \n(Tr. 108-109) Applicant asserted that she received a 1099-C form from the creditor \ncanceling the debt, and said she filed it with her 2022 taxes (after the hearing). (AE B) \nThis is undocumented. This debt is not resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.n ($604) is an account placed for collection by a bank. (GE 8) The debt \nis now charged off and had not been resolved. Tr. 107-108) The account balance is now \n$873, following a $272 payment on May 12, 2023. (AE C) Applicant asserted that the \ndebt is now satisfied following this payment. (AE B) This debt is being paid. \nSOR \u00b6 1.o ($443) is a credit-card account placed for collection by a federal credit \nunion. (GE 7, GE 8) The debt is unpaid, and Applicant had not made payment \narrangements (Tr. 107) She asserted post-hearing that the debt has now been paid, on \nMay 12, 2023, but this is not documented. (AE B) This debt is not resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.p ($222) is a retail credit account placed for collection by a bank. (GE 7, \nGE 8) Applicant asserted the debt has been paid. (Tr. 106; AE B) She provided no \ncorroborating documentation. This debt is not resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.q ($187) is a medical account placed for collection. (GE 8) This is \naccount is shown as paid. (GE 7 at 2; Tr. 105-106) This debt is resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.r ($2,279) is an account placed for collection by a bank. (GE 7; 8) It is \nnow charged off. (GE 12 at 4) She had taken no action to resolve it by the hearing. (Tr. \n6 \n\n \n \n104-105) The balance is now $2,748, though post-hearing, Applicant received a \nsettlement offer of $950. (AE B, AE C) This debt is not resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.s ($699) is a retail credit account placed for collection by a bank. It has \nnow been charged off. (GE 8, GE 12 at 14) Applicant was not aware that she has made \nany payments to resolve it. (Tr. 101-104) Post-hearing, she asserted that the debt was \npaid in 2021, but she was unable to access the payoff letter. (AE B) This debt is not \nresolved. \nThe February 2023 credit report shows a new past-due account, for $6,009. (GE \n12) This account relates to the car that was wrecked in July 2021 when Applicant \nincurred her second DUI. She has not heard from the creditor about the debt and will \nhave to look into it. (Tr. 112-113, 119-121) Post-hearing, she contacted the creditor and \nintends to resolve the debt through a payment plan. (AE B) \nApplicant does not have a 401(k) retirement plan. She receives no child support. \nShe pays a $1,350 monthly mortgage. She does not own a car. During most of the \npandemic, she worked at home full time. She now works at the office three days a \nweek. She takes public transportation and ride-sharing services to go to work. She was \nalso \u201ctraumatized\u201d by her 2021 DWI, so she is reluctant to get another car. She has not \nparticipated in credit counseling. (Tr. 85-89, 125, 131-132) \nApplicant also acknowledged that, although she has a tax preparer and she filed \na request for an extension, her 2021 federal and state income tax returns remained \nunfiled at the time of the hearing. Her 2022 returns, due weeks before the hearing date \n(absent an extension) were also unfiled. She had no explanation for the delays but is in \ncontact with her tax preparer to address the filings. She does not have any outstanding \ntax balance. (Tr. 126-133) \nApplicant has taken several international vacations since 2016, including to the \nCaribbean (2016, 2018, 2019, 2021, and April 2023, two weeks before the hearing), \nMexico (2017, 2021), and to Europe and the United Kingdom (UK) (2018, 2022). Her \ntrips to the UK are financed by a former romantic partner whom she visits there, but she \nhas paid for the other trips. These trips are for a few days at a time and she says her \ntrips cost about $1,200. (Tr. 89-98, 123-125) Applicant does not see these expenses as \nrelated to her clearance eligibility since she can afford to pay for them. (Tr. 98-99) \nApplicant concluded her testimony by stating that she recognizes that her \npersonal life is rather \u201cchaotic,\u201d but she attested that it has not affected her job. She is \nlearning from her mistakes and has had to learn many life lessons firsthand. She is the \nfirst person in her family to graduate from college. She is trying to do right and raise her \ndaughter and care for her pets. She wants to keep her clearance and her job and keep \nmoving forward. (Tr. 141-145) \nIn her post-hearing statement, Applicant said she has made huge strides in \nclearing up her debts and wants to be debt free in 2024. She also said that her second \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDUI was one of the biggest mistakes of her life. She recognizes that alcohol is \ndangerous and should be consumed responsibly. She was not able to verify the status \nof her probation and asserts that she will continue to abide by probation requirements \nuntil her probation ends in January 2024. She will also file her tax returns. (AE A) \nApplicant said she has worked hard to get where she is, and the loss of her \nclearance would have a significant negative impact upon her professional and personal \nlife. She has tried to get her life back to normal since her 2021 DUI, despite many \nhardships. (AE A) \nA friend and a co-worker provided reference letters. The friend attested to \nApplicant\u2019s fine and responsible character, as well as her remorse for her bad decision \n(likely the 2021 DUI). She is committed to rehabilitation. (AE D) The co-worker attested \nto Applicant\u2019s work ethic, professionalism, and dedication, as well as her positive \nattitude, friendliness, and proactive willingness to help others. (AE E) \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court has held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on \nmere speculation or conjecture. \n8 \n\n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nAnalysis \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nThe security concern regarding alcohol consumption is set forth in AG \u00b6 21: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 22. The following disqualifying condition is applicable in this case: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with an alcohol \nuse disorder. \nApplicant has incurred two alcohol-related driving offenses, one in August 2018 \n(SOR \u00b6 2.a) and one in July 2021 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b, 2.c, 2.d), all alleged under Guideline J \nand cross-alleged under Guideline G (SOR \u00b6 3.a). As to the latter offense, the three \ncharges (DUI, DWI, and DUI while transporting a minor) are alleged separately in the \nSOR but they are all part of the same circumstance, so I consider them as such. AG \u00b6 \n22(a) applies to both arrests. \nConditions that could mitigate alcohol consumption security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 23. The following are potentially applicable: \n9 \n\n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations. \nApplicant\u2019s two DUI/DWI arrests both occurred after she submitted her SCA, in \nJuly 2018, one only a month later. They occurred only about three years apart. She \nremains on probation for her second offense until January 2024. These two offenses \nare recent enough that they remain a security concern, as evidenced by the fact that \nshe remains on probation. They did not occur under unusual circumstances, indeed, \nthey both occurred after social drinking. Applicant is given some credit for \nacknowledging her issues with alcohol and for compliance with the requirements of \nprobation. However, the fact that both DUIs occurred after she submitted her SCA is \nparticularly problematic since the timing undercuts a finding of reform and rehabilitation. \nApplicant has also not yet demonstrated a track record of responsible conduct when \nshe is no longer subject to the state\u2019s restrictions. With time, she may be able to \ndemonstrate that she is again a suitable candidate for eligibility for access to classified \ninformation by establishing a longer period of responsible alcohol use and compliance \nwith the law. But more time is needed for Applicant to demonstrate that her alcohol \nissues are behind her and that she handles life stresses in a more responsible manner \nthan turning to alcohol. She did not establish that her offenses occurred under unusual \ncircumstances, that her alcohol-related misconduct is unlikely to recur, or that her \nbehavior no longer casts doubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 23(a) and 23(b) do not fully apply to mitigate the Guideline G security concerns. \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 30 details the security concern for criminal conduct: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; \n10 \n\n \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted; \nand \n(c) individual is currently on parole or probation. \nApplicant\u2019s two alcohol-related arrests and offenses (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d) also \nsatisfy AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and (b) under Guideline J. The other allegations (driving with a \nsuspended registration, reckless driving, negligent driving, SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.e, 2.f, and 2.g) all \noccurred in July 2021 at the same time as the second DUI arrest. As such, they are not \nseparate incidents. They are also traffic offenses, rather than criminal conduct. Either \nway, they are not established as a Guideline J security concern. Thus, no disqualifying \nconditions under Guideline J apply to them. Having pled guilty to DWI in January 2022 \nfor the July 2021 incident, she remains on probation until January 2024. AG \u00b6 31(c) \napplies. \nAG \u00b6 32 sets forth the potentially applicable mitigating conditions: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and 32(d) do not apply to mitigate Applicant\u2019s two DUI/DWI offenses \nunder Guideline J under the same rationale as set forth under Guideline G. She also \nremains on probation, a specific disqualifying condition. Applicant simply needs more \ntime to demonstrate compliance with legal requirements and general good judgment \nbefore her alcohol-related offenses can be considered mitigated. \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set \nout in AG & 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \n11 \n\n \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handing and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe Government established that Applicant has $75,000 in federal student loans \nthat became delinquent, and about $21,000 in other delinquent debts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and \n(c) apply. \nAG \u00b6 20 sets forth conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising from \nfinancial difficulties. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant has had a difficult few years. Her mother had a debilitating stroke in \n2020 that proved fatal within a year, leaving Applicant to raise her daughter and \n12 \n\n \n \nmanage her household alone. The second DUI, occurring about a year later, was likely \ncaused in part by the impact of these events. Applicant has made payments reducing \nmost of her consumer debts. Some smaller debts have been paid and she has \ndocumented that she has made payments on others. These accounts are found in her \nfavor given her efforts to resolve them. She is not required to pay them all off, or to do \nso in a particular way. She must show a plan, must show that the plan is reasonable, \nand must take steps towards implementing the plan with a track record of payments. \nFor some of her debts, she has done this. \nHowever, there is also evidence that weighs against mitigation of her whole \nfinancial situation. Applicant has not shown that she has ever addressed her federal \nstudent loans. She also has incurred more recent past-due debt that was not alleged. \nShe owes another $6,000 on her car \u2013 a car that was totaled in the July 2021 accident \nthat led to her second DUI arrest in three years. At the time of the hearing, two recent \nyears of tax returns were unfiled. The car debt and the unfiled returns are not alleged in \nthe SOR, so they cannot be considered as disqualifying conduct (as they might have \nbeen, under AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(c) and 19(f), specifically concerning unfiled tax returns). But they \ncan be considered in weighing mitigation. \nApplicant also has a history of taking international vacations, including shortly \nbefore the hearing, when that money might have been better used to address her \nsignificant debt load. That evidence undercuts a finding that she is acting responsibly in \naddressing her debts. Her federal student loans have been in forbearance due to \nCOVID for over three years. But they were delinquent before that, and Applicant will \nneed to address them responsibly when the forbearance period soon ends. She has not \nyet set out a plan to do that. \nFor these reasons, while some of her debts are mitigated due to her repayment \nefforts, none of these mitigating conditions fully apply to her overall financial situation. \nApplicant\u2019s financial delinquencies are largely ongoing and unresolved and they \ncontinue to cast doubt on her current judgment, trustworthiness, and reliability. She has \nnot shown enough reasonable action towards addressing her debts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20 \n(b), and 20(d) do not fully apply to mitigate the financial security concern. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \n13 \n\n \n \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines F, G, and J in my whole-person analysis. Overall, the record evidence \nleaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c-1.d: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.f-1.k: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.l, 1.m: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.n: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.o, 1.p: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.q: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.r-1.s: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2: Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.e-2.g: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline G: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a: \nAgainst Applicant \n14 \n\n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security to grant Applicant a security clearance.

Administrative Judge \nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, Applicant did not \nmitigate drug and criminal conduct concerns.

He claimed prior marijuana use with explanations. He claimed he rarely \nused marijuana between 2015 and 2019 and last used the substance in September \n2019 during a family trip. He claimed his job termination in October 2014 was \nattributable to his drug use, and he passed similarly administered drug tests with other \nemployers in 2015. He further claimed that he could not remember the circumstances \nsurrounding his drug-related citation in 2009. He claimed, too, that he completed his \nthree years of supervised probation within two years while staying sober with the \nsupport of his family and friends at the time. And he claimed he was selling marijuana in \nsmall amounts to people he knew in 2005-2006 to support his family during his return to \ncollege. \nAddressing the cross-alleged criminal allegations associated with his drug arrests \nand charges, Applicant claimed he never meant to harm people with his poor choices in \nof drug selling. Going forward, Applicant claimed he is committed to providing and \nsetting a his best example for his children while doing what he can to atone for his past \nmistakes \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 43-year-old civilian for a defense contractor who seeks a security \nclearance.

The felony \ncharges were reduced to a misdemeanor, and Applicant was found guilty of a marijuana \nviolation (a misdemeanor) in June 2006. In turn, he was sentenced to 18 months of un- \nsupervised probation. (GEs 1-3; Tr.  29, 36) \nFollowing his completion of his probation conditions in 2007, Applicant resumed \nhis usage of marijuana. (Tr. 37-38) Returning from college in May 2009, he reinstituted \nhis purchasing and selling of marijuana to earn money to pay his bills (typically \u00bc to \u00bd \nof a pound). (Tr. 28-29, 36-37) In June 2009, Applicant was stopped and searched by \npolice while driving his wife\u2019s car.

Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988), \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a \nsecurity clearance.\u201d As Commander in Chief, \u201cthe President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. Eligibility for \naccess to classified information may only be granted \u201cupon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe AGs list guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision-making \nprocess covering DOHA cases. These AG guidelines take into account factors that \ncould create a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as \nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. The AG guidelines include conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of \nthe conditions that could mitigate security concerns, if any. \nThese guidelines must be considered before deciding whether or not a security \nclearance should be granted, continued, or denied. Although, the guidelines do not \nrequire judges to place exclusive reliance on the enumerated disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a decision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context \nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n5 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \n Drug Involvement \n \n           \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \nThe Concern: The illegal use of controlled substances, to include \nthe misuse of prescription drugs, and the use of other substances that \ncause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, \nrules, and regulations.

Applicant\u2019s involvement with illegal drugs \nraise security concerns over whether Applicant\u2019s actions reflect pattern marijuana use \nand involvement incompatible with the judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness \nrequirements for gaining access to classified information. \nDrug involvement concerns \nApplicant\u2019s admissions of using marijuana raise security concerns over risks of \nrecurrence as well as judgment issues. On the strength of the evidence presented, two \ndisqualifying conditions (DCs) of the AGs for drug involvement apply to Applicant\u2019s \nsituation: DC \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), \u201dany substance misuse\u201d; and 25(c), \u201cillegal possession of a \ncontrolled substance, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or \ndistribution; or possession of Illegal drugs or drug paraphernalia.\u201d \nTo his credit, Applicant has committed to abandoning all involvement with \nmarijuana. For over three years, he has remained abstinent from illegal drugs (inclusive \nof marijuana) and exhibits no visible signs or indications of succumbing to any risks or \npressures he might encounter to return to illegal drug use in the foreseeable future. For \nhis past involvement in marijuana misuse, he expressed regret for the poor decisions he \nmade in using, purchasing, and selling the substance. \nRecognizing his need to set a better example for his wife and children (even in a \nstate where marijuana is currently legalized), he abandoned illegal drugs and changed \nhis lifestyle for the better. Overall, he has shown marked improvement in his judgment \nand maturity level in the three-plus years he has abstained from marijuana use and \npurchases and disassociated from individuals known for their involvement in illegal \ndrugs. \n7 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nApplicant\u2019s assurances of sustained abstinence from illegal drugs (inclusive of \nmarijuana) are encouraging. And, his efforts warrant partial application of two mitigating \nconditions (MCs) of the drug involvement guideline: MC \u00b6\u00b6 26(a), \u201cthe behavior \nhappened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such unusual \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\u201d; and 26(b), \n\u201cthe individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) providing a \nsigned statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse \nis grounds for revocation of national security eligibility .  .  .\u201d \nStill, with the combination of extensive quantities of marijuana Applicant was \nexposed to over his 23 years of use, purchases, and illegal drug activity, it is still too \nsoon to absolve Applicant of risks of recurrence. Without more time to establish a more \nprobative pattern of sustained abstinence from the use, purchase, and sale, of illegal \ndrugs, none of the mitigating conditions are fully available to Applicant at this time. With \nonly three-plus years of demonstrated abstinence from marijuana and involvement, \nmore time with more corroborating evidentiary sources to support his continued \nabstinence are needed to facilitate safe predictions that he is no longer a recurrence \nrisk. \nApplicant\u2019s drug-related criminal arrests and convictions, while aged, reflect part \nof a historical pattern of illegal drug abuse and cannot be severed from his years of \ncontinued marijuana use and purchases without engaging in a piecemeal analysis long \ndisfavored by the Appeal Board.

His laudatory endorsements from managers, supervisors, \ncoworkers, and friends, while impressive, are not enough to counter his history of drug-\nrelated criminal conduct associated with his past marijuana sales. \nWhile this is not a close case, even close cases must be resolved in the favor of \nthe national security. See Dept. of Navy v. Egan, supra. Quite apart from any illegal \ndrug concerns the Government may have for the clearance holder employed by a \ndefense contractor, the Government has the right to expect good judgment and \ntrustworthy behavior or sustained periods of time from the trust relationship it has with \nthe clearance holder. See Snepp v. United States, 444 U.S. 507, 511n.6 (1980) Three-\nplus years of sustained abstinence from marijuana use and purchases, while \nencouraging, are not enough to facilitate safe predictions that he can avoid recurrent \nmarijuana use and purchases and other marijuana-related activities in the future. \nWhole-person assessment \nFrom a whole-person perspective, Applicant has failed to establish enough \nindependent probative evidence of his overall maturity, good judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness required of those who seek eligibility to hold a security clearance or \nsensitive position. While he presents with many positive reinforcements from his \nmanagers, supervisors, coworkers, and friends, of his overall reliability and \ntrustworthiness, he lacks a sufficient track record of sustained avoidance of resumed \nuse, purchases, and sales of marijuana to facilitate safe predictions he is at no risk of \nrecurrence. \nConsidering the record as a whole at this time, including Applicant\u2019s recognized \ncontributions to the nation\u2019s defense efforts, and granting due weight to the positive \nsteps Applicant has taken to sustain his commitments to avoidance of illegal drug \ninvolvement, there is insufficient probative evidence of sustainable mitigation in the \nrecord at this time to make safe predictable judgments about Applicant\u2019s ability to avoid \nillegal drugs and drug activities in the foreseeable future. Taking into account all of the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s drug-related activities over a 23-year \nperiod with only three-plus years of sustained avoidance, he does not mitigate security \nconcerns with respect to the allegations covered by SOR \u00b6\u00b61.a-1.e of Guideline H and \n2.a of Guideline J.    \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v.

(GE 2 and GE 3) \nApplicant was first sponsored for a security clearance after being hired as an \nengineering technician for a defense contractor in January 2017. She completed and \ncertified her security clearance application (SCA) on October 25, 2017. In early 2018, her \nemployer lost the federal contract, but she was rehired by the new contractor for a short \ntime. She was laid off in April 2018 and unemployed through at least November 2018, at \nthe time of her investigative interview. She received child support payments of $406 every \ntwo weeks. (GE 2 and GE 3) \nIn March 2018, Applicant was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol \n(DUI). She pled guilty to DUI and as part of her punishment, she paid fines, attended \ncourt-ordered alcohol counseling, and was required to have her car fitted with an interlock \ndevice until November 2018. (GE 3) \nApplicant has been employed by a federal contractor since at least August 2020. \n(GE 4 at 2, and GE 5 at 1) In email correspondence dated August 23, 2022, Applicant \nstates she \u201c[has] a good paying job that is allowing [her] to get [her] financial situation \nunder control.\u201d (AE A) \nThe SOR alleges 11 delinquent debts totaling about $32,000. The debts consist of \nfour delinquent consumer accounts of about $15,100 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.j, and 1.k) and \nseven defaulted student loans of about $16,900 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c through 1.i). The debts are \nestablished through Applicant\u2019s admissions and four credit bureau reports. (GE 1, and \nGE 3 through GE 6). She reported no financial issues in her October 2017 SCA. She also \ndenied being delinquent on any federal debt; and, in the last seven years, defaulting on \nany type of loan; having bills or debts turned over to collections; having any account or \ncredit card suspended; and being delinquent over 120 days on any debt. (GE 2) \nSeveral delinquent debts included in GE 4 through GE 7 are not alleged in the \nSOR. For example, there are six non-SOR medical debts; four of these debts were \nassigned to collections in 2013 and 2014; the remaining two were assigned to collections \nin 2017. Any non-SOR derogatory information will not be considered for disqualifying \npurposes but may be considered in the application of extenuating and mitigating \nconditions, and in the whole-person analysis.

Under the contract, the company agreed to resolve seven \ndelinquent debts totaling $15,708. (AE A) Four debts in the contract are alleged in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.j, and 1.k. Three non-SOR debts in the contract are a medical account and \ntwo credit card accounts that were opened in August 2021. The evidence shows Applicant \nexceeded the creditors\u2019 credit card limits in both accounts. (GE 5, pp. 4 and 8). \nApplicant attributed her financial problems to her \u201c[inability] to afford her debts at \nhand due to financial hardship;\u201d and being laid off in April 2018 followed by her \nunemployment for a period of time afterwards. Applicant also points to her status as a \nsingle mother of two children, with an economy \u201cgoing up\u201d as factors that negatively \nimpacted her ability to repay delinquent debts. (GE 1 and AE A). \nIn her Response to the SOR, Applicant distinguished her delinquent debts between \nnon-student loans, and student loans. For non-student loan debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, \n1.b, 1.j, and 1.k, she commented: \u201c[These] are debts that I need to contact the collectors \nto see what payment plan I can afford or see what I can work out to resolve the issue.\u201d \nFor student loan debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c through 1.i, she commented: \nFor the longest time I was on a hardship form (sic) due to being a single \nmother with two children and the economy going up. I did not remit that form \nin time. Before I could start another form COVID-19 hit and my payments \nwere not need[ed] at the time because the President put all education \npayments on relief momentarily. I am aware that I still need to pay that once \nit\u2019s lifted. I will then apply for a hardship application. (GE 1) \nThe available credit bureau reports do not show payments on the delinquent \nstudent loans alleged in the SOR. (GE 4 through GE 7) Though Applicant signed the debt \nresolution contract in August 2022, she has not provided proof of actual payments in \naccordance with the contract. (AE A). The evidence also shows her debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b \nand 1.k were either charged off or in a collection status in 2017. (GE 4) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable, and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence.

The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, including defaulted student loans and \ndelinquent consumer debts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) are applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant attributed her financial problems to her \u201c[inability] to afford her debts at \nhand due to financial hardship;\u201d being laid off in April 2018 followed by her unemployment, \nand being a single mother of two children in an inflationary economy as factors affecting \nher ability to repay delinquent debts. \nThe delinquents debts in SOR \u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.j, and 1.k, are partially, but not fully \nmitigated under AG \u00b6 20(d). Applicant is credited for efforts made towards resolving some \nof her debts through her 48-month contract with a debt-settlement company. However, \nshe signed the contract in August 2022 well after issuance of the SOR. She provided no \nproof or record of payments made in compliance with the terms of the contract. The timing \nof ameliorative action is a factor that should be brought to bear in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \ncase for mitigation. An applicant who begins to resolve security concerns only after having \nbeen placed on notice that his or her clearance is in jeopardy may lack the judgment and \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwillingness to follow rules and regulations when his or her personal interests are not \nthreatened. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-04110 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 26, 2019).  \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not established by the evidence. The record is clear Applicant was \nlaid off in April 2018, through at least November 2018. The record is unclear, however, \nregarding the entirety of this period of unemployment. Applicant did not present evidence \nregarding this missing information. Additionally, the record shows her debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.b and 1.k were either charged off or in a collection status in 2017, well before she was \nlaid off in April 2018. There is also evidence she was arrested for DUI in March 2018, \ncausing additional financial strain. Applicant has not met her burden of demonstrating she \nacted responsibly under the circumstances. \nApplicant has experienced longstanding problems addressing her delinquent \nstudent loans in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c through 1.i, opened in 2010. She admits that, on more than \none occasion, she did not complete forms necessary for a Department of Education \nfinancial hardship consideration. She states she is currently unable to remedy the \nsituation because of the President\u2019s action in temporarily stopping repayment. In her SOR \nResponse, she comments she will likely seek a hardship application after the President\u2019s \nmoratorium is lifted. \nThere is insufficient evidence for a determination that Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems will be resolved within a reasonable period. I am unable to find that she acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances or that she made a good-faith effort to pay her debts. \nHer financial issues are ongoing, and continue to cast doubt on her current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. I find that financial considerations security concerns \nremain despite the presence of some mitigation. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-\nperson analysis.  \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.k: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

He explained that his mother raised him with his grandmother, and \nthey lived together. It was about this time that his grandmother, with whom he was very \nclose, passed away. Applicant suffered from severe depression and went in the wrong \ndirection. He started using illegal drugs like marijuana, cocaine, and alcohol and as \ntime passed he became addicted.

Following each arrest and conviction, \nhe served time in jail, anywhere from several weeks to several months; and on two \noccasions, he went to prison.

(Tr. 77.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence that \nestablishes controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \n\u201capplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, \nand has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance \ndecision.\u201d \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual\u2019s judgement, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matter of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless \nof whether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted or \nconvicted. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 31 contains conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. Both of the conditions are applicable. \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited to, the \npassage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, compliance \nwith the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher education, good \nemployment record, or constructive community involvement. \nApplicant\u2019s criminal record which occurred from 1988 to 2010 is extensive and \negregious. However, since then, he has made a remarkable change in his life. He went \nto college and learned about his addiction so much that he became a Certified Alcohol \nand Drug Abuse Counselor and opened his own Recovery Program to help people like \nhimself. He operated his program for many years before he had to close it for lack of \nfunding. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit D.) For the past thirteen years, his criminal record has \nbeen impeccable. \nApplicant has had no arrests or violations of the law. \nHe is \ncommended for his great accomplishments in life, and for helping many people with \ntheir addictions. He has grown and matured and established that he is sufficiently \nreliable and trustworthy. On the surface, his many violations of the law in the past give \nrise to serious concerns, however, a closer look shows that all of these occurred over \nthirteen years ago. They are now a thing of the long-ago past. His judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness for the past thirteen years has been intact and demonstrates that he \nis responsible and law-abiding. \nThe before-mentioned disqualifying conditions have \nbeen mitigated. The Criminal Conduct guideline is found for the Applicant. \nGuideline E- Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for Personal Conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 16. Two are potentially applicable in this case: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a while-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information, and \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n  \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nThis includes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of \nclient confidentiality, release of proprietary information, \nunauthorized release of sensitive corporate or government \nprotected information; \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations. \nThere are conditions mitigating security concerns under AG \u00b6 17. Both of them \nare applicable here. \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur. \nThe cause of his criminal conduct was his illegal drug and alcohol abuse and \naddiction. After finally getting tired of living like he was, Applicant educated himself \nabout his addiction, put his learning into practice, and was able to stop using illegal \ndrugs and alcohol altogether in 2010. For the past thirteen years he has not used any \nillegal drugs or alcohol. He has turned his life around and been extremely productive in \nsociety. He has cured himself and started helping others with their substance abuse \nproblems. Applicant has been law abiding and demonstrated that he can be trusted. In \ntotality, his conduct shows a high degree of maturity, good judgment, trustworthiness \nand reliability. Accordingly, the Personal Conduct guideline is found for the Applicant. \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Four are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax \nreturns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required. \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent tax debts to the Federal and state governments total in \nexcess of $140,000. These debts remain owing. The evidence is sufficient to raise the \nabove disqualifying conditions. \nThe following mitigating conditions under the Financial Considerations guideline \nare potentially applicable under AG \u00b6 20; \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g. loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant remains excessively indebted to both the Federal Government and to \nthe State for delinquent back taxes totaling in excess of $140,000. He has failed to \nprovide sufficient evidence in mitigation. His delinquent tax debt will take some time to \n10 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nresolve. Applicant has known for many years about his financial tax delinquencies and \nhas done nothing until recently to resolve it. Applicant\u2019s inaction for so long reflects a \npattern of unreliability, untrustworthiness, and poor judgment. \nWhen it comes to \nfinancial matters he has not shown the level of responsibility required. In fact, most of \nthe back taxes set forth in the SOR remain owing, and have only recently begun to be \naddressed by the Applicant when he learned he would need a security clearance. \nApplicant does not meet the requirements to access classified information. Accordingly, \nthe Financial Considerations guideline is found against the Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent \nto which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines J, E, and F, in my whole-person analysis. \nBased upon the facts and \nanalysis set forth above, Applicant has failed to provide sufficient evidence to \ndemonstrate that he meets the qualifications for a security clearance. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the Financial Considerations security concerns. \nThe Criminal Conduct and Personal Conduct concerns are found for the Applicant. \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n             \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \n \nCriminal Conduct:  \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.u. \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nPersonal Conduct \nSubparagraph 2.a. \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline F: \nFinancial Considerations \nSubparagraphs 3.a. through 3.e. \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

She and \nher husband are now separated and planning a divorce. As part of their agreement to \nseparate, they sold their house and split the proceeds. Using her share of these proceeds, \nApplicant satisfied all the delinquent debts. I conclude Applicant has mitigated the \nfinancial considerations security concerns. As for the personal conduct allegation of \nintentional failure to disclose bills that were in charged off or collection status, I conclude \nthese omissions were unintentional given the amount of information that Applicant shared \non her security clearance application about her financial condition. I conclude that there \nare no personal conduct security concerns. Clearance is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn May 2, 2022, the Department of Defense Counterintelligence and Security \nAgency Consolidated Adjudications Services (CAS) issued a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline F, financial \nconsiderations, and Guideline E, personal conduct, explaining why it was unable to find \nit clearly consistent with the national security to grant security clearance eligibility.

On March 21, 2022, Applicant answered the \nSOR, denying all the allegations except subparagraphs 1.h through 1.j., and she \nrequested a hearing. On April 28, 2023, the case was assigned to me. On June 13, 2023, \nthe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of video \nteleconference hearing, scheduling the hearing for July 17, 2023. \nThe hearing was held as scheduled. I received eight Government exhibits, marked \nas Government Exhibit (GE) 1 through GE 8, and I received ten exhibits from Applicant, \nmarked as Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AE) A through AE J, and I considered the testimony of \nApplicant. I kept the record open at Applicant\u2019s request to allow her to submit additional \nexhibits. Within the time allotted she submitted one exhibit that I marked and incorporated \ninto the record as AE K. The transcript was received on July 26, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 57-year-old woman with three adult children. Although she is legally \nmarried, she has been separated from her husband since September 2021, and they are \nin the process of filing for a divorce. (Tr. 102) \nApplicant is a high school graduate and she earned an associate degree in \nbusiness administration in 1999. (Tr. 27) Currently, she works for a contractor as a\nsecurity specialist. (Tr. 44) She has been promoted twice during the past six months. (Tr. \n44) She has held a security clearance since 2014. (Tr.14) \n \nSince 2002, financial problems have compelled Applicant to file for bankruptcy \nprotection three times. Applicant\u2019s first bout with financial difficulties, beginning in the \nearly 2000s, occurred when her husband, a U.S. military member, received permanent \nchange of station orders to a location where expenses such as housing and DOD public \nschooling were not provided, and there was no convenient access to a commissary. (Tr. \n33) Applicant, then a stay-at-home mother, considered taking a job to help make ends \nmeet. (Tr. 35) However, this proved untenable as she was pregnant with her third child \nand was pre-occupied with raising the two older children. (Tr. 35) Subsequently, Applicant \nand her husband decided to file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection. (GE 7) On May 7, \n2002, the bankruptcy judge discharged their debt. The amount of the discharged debt is \nunknown from the record. \nApplicant\u2019s next bout of financial problems occurred approximately five years later \nand was triggered by marital problems when her husband \u201cabandoned [Applicant] and \n[their] kids\u201d and began seeing another woman. (Tr. 36) When her husband moved, he \nstopped helping pay the bills. Furthermore, Applicant discovered that he had not been \nusing the base housing allowance to pay the rent, and that they were three months \nbehind. (Tr. 36) Although Applicant was working at this time, she again fell behind on the \nbills.

(GE 6) She included \n$45,000 of debt in the bankruptcy petition. (GE 6 at 27) Applicant failed to make \nbankruptcy payments, prompting the court to dismiss the petition in July 2008. (Tr. 37) \nSubsequently, Applicant and her husband reconciled. (Tr. 37) At or about this time, \nApplicant\u2019s financial fortunes changed for the better, as she obtained a job as a general \nmanager of a major restaurant chain, and a part-time job working at a hospital. (Tr. 37) \nThe income from these jobs, together with the income of her husband, enabled Applicant \nto satisfy her delinquent debts. \nFor the next ten years Applicant\u2019s finances remained stable. (Tr. 37) Then, in \napproximately 2018, her husband lost his job. (Tr. 38, 76) Depressed, he struggled with \nsuicidal ideation, and stopped either looking for another job or helping pay the bills. (Tr. \n38, 81) Their joint income decreased by $250,000, to $50,000 annually. (Tr. 88) \nIn September 2019, Applicant and her husband filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy. \n(GE 5) The petition included $97,291 of debt. (GE 5 at 32) Applicant\u2019s financial situation \nworsened further when her employer laid her off from the job the same month. (Tr. 99; \nGE 1 at 12) Shortly thereafter, the bankruptcy court dismissed the bankruptcy petition. \n(Tr. 98) Applicant remained unemployed for four months. (GE 1 at 13) \nApplicant was unemployed through February 2020. (GE 8 at 1) In 2021, she and \nher husband again separated. (Tr. 102) In September 2022, they sold their house for 1.1 \nmillion dollars. (Tr. 101) They had originally purchased it in 2016 for $800,000. (Tr. 79) \nThey netted $140,000 which they split. (Tr. 104) Using her share of the profit from the \nsale of the house, Applicant satisfied all of the SOR debts, alleged in SOR subparagraphs \n1.a through 1.g, and made an agreement to satisfy the debt as set forth below: \nDebt \nAmount \nDate Satisfied \nRecord Evidence \n1.a \n$18,655 \n8/22/22 \nD; Tr. 106, 111 \n1.b. \n$4,216 \n8/31/22 \nE \n1.c. \n$3,726 \nPayment letter undated J \n1.d. \n$494 \nPayment letter undated F \n1.e. \n$1,162 \n8/31/22 \nG \n1.f \n$16,129 \n9/8/2022 \nH \n1.g. \n$1,341 \n9/27/22 \nI \nCurrently, Applicant has $25,000 in savings.

At the conclusion of the divorce \nproceedings, she anticipates receiving $1,000 per month as her share of her husband\u2019s \npension. (Tr. 145) \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant did not disclose her debts  that had been either \nturned over to collection, suspended, charged off, or cancelled in the past seven years, \nas required, on a security clearance application (SCA) completed in February 2020. She \nadmits omitting these debts from her SCA, but contends that the omissions were \nunintentional. She explained that she was aware that the debts were delinquent, but \nunaware that they had been turned over for collection, suspended, charged off, or \ncancelled. Elsewhere on the security clearance application, Applicant disclosed her 2007 \nand 2019 bankruptcy petition filings, and she disclosed financial counseling assistance \nshe was receiving in response to the question, \u201care you currently utilizing or seeking \nassistance form any other similar resource to resolve your financial difficulties.\u201d  (GE 1 at \n45)  She elaborated further that she was \u201cnegotiat[ing] directly with the companies . . to \neliminate all [her] debts,\u201d and that she had \u201csent letter[s] to the companies to get a[n] \naccurate balance of how much [she] owes . . .,\u201d and that she had contacted credit \nreporting agencies to get copies of credit reports and credit scores. (GE 1 at 45) \nApplicant has been working at her current job since September 2021. (AE K) \nAccording to her supervisor, she \u201chas exuded exceptional trustworthiness and dedication \nin the performance of her duties.\u201d (AE K) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, \nemphasizing that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security \nclearance, the administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be \nconsidered in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 1(d) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present \nevidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \nthe applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, \nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department \nCounsel. . ..\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable \nsecurity decision. \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine \nadjudicative process factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). They are as follows: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; \n(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation;  \n(3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; \n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;  \n(5) the extent to which participation is voluntary;  \n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes;  \n(7) the motivation for the conduct;  \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and  \n(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nUnder this concern, \u201cfailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to \nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information.\u201d (AG \u00b6 \n18)  \nApplicant\u2019s recurrent history of bankruptcy filings and delinquent debts triggers the \napplication of AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts,\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not \nmeeting financial obligations.\u201d \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond\nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or separation, clear \n \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant\u2019s first bout of financial problems, experienced in the early 2000s, \noccurred when her husband, a military member, received permanent change of station \norders to a location where he did not receive the typical support such as a base housing \nallowance or access to a DOD public school or commissary. (Tr. 33) Applicant\u2019s next bout \nof financial problems occurred in 2007 after her husband left the family and stopped \npaying his share of the bills, and Applicant\u2019s most recent financial problems occurred after \nher husband lost his job and was unable to help with the bills. Applicant and her husband \nare now separated and planning to divorce. Using her share of proceeds from the sale of \ntheir home, Applicant has paid all of the SOR debts. \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems were recurrent and she just recently resolved them. \nConversely, nearly all of her financial problems over the last 15 years have stemmed from \nmarital instability when her estranged husband either would not, or could not, help with \nthe bills. Because Applicant is pursuing a divorce, her financial stability will no longer be \ndependent on her husband, minimizing the likelihood of debt recurrence. Under these \ncircumstances, I conclude AG \u00b6 20(a) applies. \nApplicant\u2019s marital instability, as described above, together with her unemployment \nfrom September 2019 to February 2020, constitute circumstances beyond her control. \nAfter she decided to separate from her husband, she used her sale of the proceeds from \nthe sale of the home to satisfy all of her debts. Currently, she has minimal credit card \ndebt, $25,000 in savings, and $2,000 in monthly discretionary income. Under these \ncircumstances, all of the remaining mitigating conditions are applicable. I conclude \nApplicant has mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nUnder this guideline, \u201cconduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, \ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive \ninformation.\u201d (AG \u00b6 15) Moreover, \u201cof special interest is any failure to cooperate or provide \ntruthful and candid answers during national security investigative or adjudicative \nprocesses.\u201d (Id.) Applicant\u2019s failure to include the debts alleged in the SOR on the 2020 \nsecurity clearance application in response to requests to disclose debts that had been \nsuspended, charged, off, cancelled or turned over to a collection raises the issue of \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n_____________________ \nwhether AG \u00b6 16(a), \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts \nfrom any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form \nused to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or \nstatus, determine national security eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary \nresponsibilities.\u201d \nApplicant did not disclose her delinquent debts in answer to certain specific \nquestions on her SCA. However, she discussed her finances in depth elsewhere on the \nsecurity clearance application, disclosing her bankruptcy petitions and her work with \ncredit counseling companies to resolve her financial issues. Under these circumstances, \nI find that her contention that the omission of the SOR debts was unintentional is credible. \nI conclude that AG \u00b6 16(a) does not apply and that there are no personal conduct security \nconcerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems were caused by circumstances beyond her control, \nshe addressed them responsibly, and they are unlikely to recur for reasons discussed in \nthe financial considerations section, above. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.j: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

This will \nchange as things progress and will keep form updated as needed.\u201d (GE 2) \nAt the time they enrolled in DSP 1, Applicant and his wife did not have any \ndelinquent debts. They enrolled 15 debts totaling over $128,000 into the program. The \ndebts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.g, 1.i, and 1.j are easily identifiable from the DSP 1 \ndocuments. The program told Applicant to stop paying on his accounts, so that DSP 1 \ncould negotiate settlements on the accounts, which the program believed it could do for \napproximately $70,000. Applicant agreed to pay $1,946 each month to the program to \nfund the debt settlements. (GE 2) \nA year later, Applicant and his wife transferred to DSP 2, which they believed had \nmore favorable terms. They enrolled 10 debts in the program totaling $117,000. \nApplicant and his wife agreed to pay $1,631 each month for 34 months. The debts \nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.g, 1.h, and 1.j are easily identifiable from the DSP 2 \ndocumentation. DSP 2 indicated that they could settle the debts for $33,121. As of \nJanuary 2021, Applicant had paid over $26,000 into the program, which has resolved \nthe debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.h as well as one non-SOR debt.

He states that they will continue to work \ndiligently to keep their debt at a manageable level. (GE 5-6) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nadministrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 \ndescribing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative \ngoal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-\nperson concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nUnresolved delinquent debt is a serious security concern because failure to \n\u201csatisfy debts [or] meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified \nor sensitive information.\u201d (AG \u00b6 18). \nIn this case, Applicant did not engage in any disqualifying conduct. The debts \nalleged in the SOR are not the result of an unwillingness or inability to pay his debts. \nApplicant does not have a history of financial mismanagement or irresponsibility. The \nreported debts are the result of Applicant\u2019s participation in a debt settlement program \u2013 \na legitimate way of addressing debt. Instead of making payment directly to the creditors, \nwho have the power to report negative information to the credit reporting agencies, he \nhas been making regular and timely payments to debt settlement programs, engaged to \nnegotiate with his creditors on his behalf since October 2019. \nBased on the record, I have no doubts about Applicant\u2019s suitability for continued \naccess to classified information. In reaching this conclusion, I have also considered the \nwhole-person factors at AG \u00b6 2(d). Security clearance adjudications are not debt \ncollection proceedings. Rather, the purpose of the adjudication is to make \u201can \nexamination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination \nthat the person is an acceptable security risk.\u201d (AG \u00b6 2(a)) \nThe AGs do not require an applicant to immediately resolve or pay each and \nevery debt alleged in the SOR, to be debt free, or to resolve first the debts alleged in the \nSOR. An applicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take \nsignificant actions to implement the plan. Applicant has done so. As a long-time \nclearance holder, he proactively handled an issue that could have negatively affected \nhis security clearance eligibility. He made changes to his finances almost immediately \nafter experiencing a significant change in his financial circumstances. He reported the \nissue to his FSO and completed a written update to his security clearance application. A \nfair and commonsense assessment of the record evidence as a whole supports a \nconclusion that Applicant did not engage in any conduct that raises a security concern \nunder the Directive. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Financial Considerations: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a \u2013 1.j \nFor Applicant \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nBased on the record, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nApplicant eligibility for a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR consists of separate responses from his attorney and himself. In his personal Answer to the SOR, Applicant denied all of the allegations. However, in the attorney portion of the Answer, he admitted with comments that his personal portion was incorrect (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a., 1.b., and 2.a.).

He has been serving as a senior engineering and operations support technician with his current employer since October 2015. He previously worked for the same employer as a senior tester (April 2015 \u2013 October 2015).

On December 15, 2021, Applicant \nresponded \nto \nthose \ninterrogatories. \nOn \nFebruary \n1, \n2022, \nthe \nDefense \nCounterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA) Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(CAF) issued him a set of interrogatories. On December 9, 2020, he responded to those \ninterrogatories. On May 13, 2021, the DCSA CAF issued him a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended and modified (Directive); and Directive 4 of the Security Executive Agent (SEAD \n1 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n4), National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (December 10, 2016) (AG), effective June \n8, 2017. \nThe SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) \nand Guideline E (Personal Conduct) and detailed reasons why the DCSA adjudicators \nwere unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue \na security clearance for Applicant. The SOR recommended referral to an administrative \njudge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or \nrevoked. \nIn a statement issued by his attorney, signed as power of attorney, dated February \n22, 2022, and signed by Applicant on February 24, 2022, Applicant responded to the SOR \nand requested a hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel indicated \nthe Government was prepared to proceed on April 19, 2022. Because of health concerns \nassociated with the COVID-19 pandemic and pandemic protocols, the case was not \nassigned to me until August 17, 2022. A Notice of Microsoft TEAMS Video \nTeleconference Hearing was issued on November 18, 2022. I convened the hearing as \nscheduled on December 12, 2022. \nDuring the hearing, Government exhibits (GE) 1 and GE 2 and Applicant exhibits \n(AE) A through AE H were admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant testified. \nThe transcript (Tr.) was received on December 22, 2022. I kept the record open to enable \nApplicant to supplement it with documentation that was identified during the hearing. He \ntook advantage of that opportunity and timely submitted two documents that were marked \nand admitted as AE I and AE J without objection. The record closed on December 16, \n2022. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR consists of separate responses from his attorney \nand himself. In his personal Answer to the SOR, Applicant denied all of the allegations. \nHowever, in the attorney portion of the Answer, he admitted with comments that his \npersonal portion was incorrect (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a., 1.b., and 2.a.). He also added attachments \n(subsequently admitted as AE A through AE H) regarding the allegations. Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions, comments, and the information in the attachments are incorporated herein. \nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due \nconsideration of same, I make the following findings of fact: \nApplicant is a 58-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving \nas a senior engineering and operations support technician with his current employer since \nOctober 2015. He previously worked for the same employer as a senior tester (April 2015 \n\u2013 October 2015). He also experienced several periods of unemployment, essentially \nbecause of layoffs (July 2011 \u2013 September 2011; June 2012 \u2013 June 2013; and October \n2014 \u2013 April 2015). He is a 1982 high school graduate, and he has received substantial \ncredits towards a bachelor\u2019s degree. He enlisted (with delayed entry in \n \n1982) in the U.S. \nNavy in January 1983, and served on active duty until January 1989, when he was \nhonorably discharged as a petty officer 1st  class (E-6).

He has held \na secret clearance since 1983. He was married in 1986 and divorced in 2013. He has \nbeen cohabiting since 2018. He has four children, born in 1984, 1993, 1997, and 1998. \nFinancial Considerations and Personal Conduct \nOn April 29, 2020, in his SF 86, Applicant denied that he had failed to timely file or \npay his federal, state, or other taxes when required by law or ordinance. (GE 1 at 35) He \nlater contended that the incorrect answer was inadvertent. (Tr. at 23-24) On May 18, \n2020, during a second interview with an investigator with OPM he acknowledged that he \nhad failed to file federal income tax returns for a multiyear period (the tax years 2009, \n2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020). (GE 2 at 46) \nOn December 15, 2021, after his OPM interview, he self-prepared and filed his federal \nincome tax returns for a multiyear period (2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020). \n(GE 2 at 2, 24-37) As of February 1, 2022 \u2013 the date of the SOR \u2013 only those long-overdue \nincome tax returns had been filed. The remaining delinquent federal income tax returns \n(2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013) still had not been filed. \nThe legal requirement to file a federal income tax return is based upon an \nindividual\u2019s gross income and other enumerated conditions. Once it is determined that \nthere is an obligation to so file, the following applies: \nAny person required under this title to pay any estimated tax or tax, or \nrequired by this title or by regulations made under authority thereof to make \na return, keep any records, or supply any information, who willfully fails to \npay such estimated tax or tax, make such return, keep such records, or \nsupply such information, at the time or times required by law or regulations, \nshall, in addition to other penalties provided by law, be guilty of a \nmisdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be fined not more than \n$25,000 ($100,000 in the case of a corporation), or imprisoned not more \nthan 1 year, or both, together with the costs of prosecution. In the case of \nany person with respect to whom there is a failure to pay any estimated tax, \nthis section shall not apply to such person with respect to such failure if \nthere is no addition to tax under section 6654 or 6655 with respect to such \nfailure. In the case of a willful violation of any provision of section 6050I, the \nfirst sentence of this section shall be applied by substituting \"felony\" for \n\"misdemeanor\" and \"5 years\" for \"1 year.\" \n(26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7203, Willful failure to file return, supply information, or pay tax.) \nOn February 23, 2022 \u2013 three weeks after the SOR was issued \u2013 Applicant\u2019s tax \npreparer/attorney completed those remaining federal income tax returns and submitted \nthem to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). (Attorney\u2019s portion of Answer to SOR at 1-2; \nAE A \u2013 AE E) Applicant initially claimed that he failed to file several of his federal income \ntax returns because he was going through marital difficulties (starting in about 2009) a \ndivorce in 2013 and he got his priorities mixed up, but later said it was his understanding \nthat there was no filing requirement since he pays his taxes through tax withholding. (Tr. \n3 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nat 22, 29; GE 2 at 46; Attorney\u2019s portion of Answer to SOR at 2) Applicant\u2019s attorney \ncharacterized the failure to timely file the federal income tax returns as being a \u201clittle bit \nbehind.\u201d (Tr. at 13) Applicant\u2019s initial claim is not a legal justification for inaction, and his \nsubsequently claimed understanding was in error. \nDuring the hearing, Applicant admitted that filing federal income tax returns is \n\u201crequired by the law.\u201d (Tr. at 41) In addition to his failure to timely file his federal income \ntax returns for the multiyear period, characterized as being due to neglect, Applicant \nclaimed to be under the impression that there were no financial obligations because his \nemployer was withholding some of his income for income tax purposes. (GE 2 at 46; \nAttorney\u2019s portion of Answer to SOR at 2) His impression was inaccurate, for he also was \ndelinquent in paying a substantial amount of income taxes for the multiyear period. \nAccording to an Installment Agreement he proposed to the IRS in February 2022, the \namount of unpaid income taxes was estimated to be $44,675. According to the proposed \nprovisions of the Installment Agreement, he agreed to pay $5,000 to the IRS on April 1, \n2022, and $500 on the 15th  day of each month thereafter. (AE F) He acknowledged that \nhe made several payments early in the agreement, but that he had subsequently missed \nseveral payments for a variety of reasons, including increased rent, home repairs, an \nautomobile wreck, and his daughter\u2019s wedding. (Tr. at 35-37) He submitted proof of one \nmonthly payment, made on February 23, 2022. (AE G)  \nApplicant\u2019s adjusted gross income during the years in question was as follows: \n$69,924 (2009), $76,482 (2010), $87,953 (2011), $61,657 (2012), $69,720 (2013), \n$72,372 (2014), $39,210 (2015), $64,811 (2016), $66,351 (2017), $70,190 (2018), \n$84,088 (2019), and $84,034 (2020). (AE A; AE B; AE C; AE D; AE E; GE 2) In December \n2021, Applicant estimated that he still owed $14,046 in delinquent income taxes. He owed \n$9,251 for 2014, $2,174 for 2015, and $2,621 for 2019. (GE 2 at 2) In February 2022, his \nattorney/tax preparer stated that the outstanding income tax balance for the tax years \n2009 \u2013 2013 was approximately $30,629. (Attorney\u2019s portion of Answer to SOR at 2) \nOn December 16, 2022, Applicant submitted a Personal Financial Statement \n(PFS) and reported a net monthly income was $4,375; monthly expenses of $1,950; and \n$2,350 in debt payments (for a home mortgage, automobile loan, a personal loan, and a \ncredit card), leaving a net monthly remainder of $75 for saving or spending. Nowhere in \nthe PFS did he report the claimed monthly $500 payment to the IRS under the Installment \nAgreement. (AE J) There is no evidence of financial counseling. \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The President has \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \n4 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nnational interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.) \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  \n(ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1))  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994)) \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)) \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 \n5 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n7) Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this \ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not \nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing a clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant failed to timely file his federal income tax returns for the tax years 2009, \n2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018. 2019, and 2020, and he failed to \npay an estimated $44,675 in federal income taxes for some of those years. In some \ncases, the federal income tax returns were not filed until several years later, well after the \nrequired filing dates. On December 15, 2021, well after he submitted his SF 86 and after \n6 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhis OPM interview, he self-prepared and filed his federal income tax returns for a multiyear \nperiod (2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020. As of February 1, 2022 \u2013 the date \nof the SOR \u2013 only those long-overdue income tax returns had been filed. The remaining \ndelinquent federal income tax returns (2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013) still had not \nbeen filed until February 23, 2022 \u2013 three weeks after the SOR was issued. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \n19(c), and 19(f) have been established. AG \u00b6 19(b) has not been established as there is \nno evidence that Applicant had been unwilling to satisfy his debts regardless of an ability \nto do so. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties under AG \u00b6 20: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b), 20(d) and 20(g) minimally apply. A debt that became delinquent \nseveral years ago is still considered recent because \u201can applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts \nevidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, can be viewed as recent for \npurposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. \nBd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). The \nnature, frequency, and recency of Applicant\u2019s delayed failure to voluntarily and timely \nresolve his delinquent federal income tax issues for several years, despite knowing that \ntimely filing of federal income tax returns was required by law, make it rather easy to \nconclude that they were not infrequent. This case involves two separate financial issues: \nthe failure to timely file federal income tax returns, and the failure to pay federal income \ntaxes. Furthermore, considering his continued failures and delayed actions in addressing \nboth issues despite earning a reasonable wage, one of his federal income tax issues \u2013 \nthe one related to payments \u2013 is likely to remain unchanged in the future, especially \n7 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nconsidering his failure to remain in full compliance with the arrangements set forth in the \nInstallment Agreement that was proposed in February 2022. \nApplicant attributed his financial issues essentially to a combination of factors. He \ninitially claimed that he failed to file several of his federal income tax returns because, \nstarting in about 2009, he was going through marital difficulties resulting in a divorce in \n2013, and he got his priorities mixed up. He later said it was his understanding that there \nwas no filing requirement since he pays his taxes through tax withholding. His attorney \ncharacterized the failure to timely file the federal income tax returns as being a \u201clittle bit \nbehind.\u201d Applicant later claimed to be under the impression that there were no financial \nobligations because his employer was withholding some of his income for income tax \npurposes. Applicant\u2019s failure to more timely address his federal income tax issues leads \nto a conclusion that his delayed actions or longstanding inaction were irresponsible.  \nAn applicant who begins to resolve his or her financial problems only after being \nplaced on notice that his or her security clearance is in jeopardy may be lacking in the \njudgment and self-discipline to follow rules and regulations over time or when there is no \nimmediate threat to his or her own interests. (See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01213 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Jun. 29, 2018); ISCR Case No. 17-00569 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Sept. 18, 2018). \nApplicant completed his SF 86 in March 2018; underwent his OPM interviews in \nMay 2020; and completed his responses to interrogatories on December 15, 2021 \u2013 the \nsame day he finally filed some of his delinquent federal income tax returns. The SOR was \nissued on February 1, 2022. He did not file the remaining delinquent federal income tax \nreturns until three weeks later. Each step of the security clearance eligibility review \nprocess placed him on notice of the significance of the financial issues confronting him. \nBy failing to rectify the status of his federal income tax return filings and non-payments \nover such a lengthy multi-year period, Applicant failed to demonstrate the high degree of \ngood judgment and reliability required of those granted access to classified information. \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has observed: \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established governmental rules and systems. Voluntary \ncompliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002). As we \nhave noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is not directed at collecting \ndebts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By \nthe same token, neither is it directed toward inducing an applicant to file tax \nreturns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s \njudgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her \nlegal obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment \nand reliability required of those granted access to classified information. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd.

Aug. 18, 2015). \nThe Appeal Board clarified that even in instances where an applicant has \npurportedly corrected his or her federal tax problem, and the fact that the applicant is now \nmotivated to prevent such problems in the future, does not preclude careful consideration \nof an applicant\u2019s security worthiness in light of his or her longstanding prior behavior \nevidencing irresponsibility including a failure to timely file federal income tax returns. (See \nISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 3 and note 3 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) (characterizing \u201cno \nharm, no foul\u201d approach to an Applicant\u2019s course of conduct and employed an \u201call\u2019s well \nthat ends well\u201d analysis as inadequate to support approval of access to classified \ninformation with focus on timing of filing of tax returns after receipt of the SOR). \nClearance decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines do not \nrequire an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the SOR. An \napplicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant \nactions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant immediately \nresolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a \nrequirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. Rather, a \nreasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such debts, or \nresolution of such issues, one at a time. Mere promises to pay debts in the future, without \nfurther confirmed action, are insufficient. In this instance, there are some promises, but \nno actual resolution efforts. \nThere is no evidence of financial counseling or a budget. It remains difficult to \ndetermine if Applicant is currently in a better position financially than he had been because \nof continuing difficulties in making his monthly payments under the Installment \nAgreement, especially since his PFS does not reflect any such payments. Applicant\u2019s \nactions, or inaction, under the circumstances cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. (See ISCR Case No. 09-08533 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Oct. \n6, 2010).) \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \n9 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or cooperate \nwith security processing, including but not limited to meeting with a security \ninvestigator for subject interview, completing security forms or releases, \ncooperation with medical or psychological evaluation, or polygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful questions of \ninvestigators, security officials, or other official representatives in \nconnection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination. \nThe guideline also includes an example of a condition that could raise security \nconcerns under AG \u00b6 16: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nMy discussions related to Applicant\u2019s financial considerations are adopted herein. \nWith respect to the alleged omission, concealment, or falsification on April 29, 2020, when \nApplicant completed his SF 86, he responded to a particular question pertaining to his \nfinancial record (\u201cIn the last seven (7) years have you failed to file or pay Federal, state, \nor other taxes when required by law or ordinance?\u201d). He answered \u201cno\u201d to that question. \nHe certified that the response was \u201ctrue, complete, and correct\u201d to the best of his \nknowledge and belief, but the response to that question was, in fact, incorrect for at that \ntime Applicant had several delinquent and unfiled federal income tax returns that fell \nwithin the stated parameters. As noted above, on May 18, 2020, during a second interview \nwith an investigator with OPM he acknowledged that he had failed to file federal income \ntax returns for a multiyear period (the tax years 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, \n2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020). On December 15, 2021, he self-prepared and \nfiled his federal income tax returns for a multiyear period (2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, \n2019, and 2020). The remaining delinquent federal income tax returns (2009, 2010, 2011, \n2012, and 2013) still had not been filed until February 23, 2022 \u2013 three weeks after the \nSOR was issued. \nApplicant\u2019s response provides sufficient evidence to examine if his submission was \na deliberate falsification, as alleged in the SOR, or merely the result of misunderstanding \nof the facts. I have considered the available information pertaining to Applicant\u2019s \nbackground and professional career in analyzing his actions. Proof of an omission, \nstanding alone, does not establish or prove an applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when \nthe falsification or omission occurred. As an administrative judge, I must consider the \nrecord evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial \nevidence concerning Applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the falsification or \nomission occurred. The Appeal Board has explained the process for analyzing \nfalsification cases, stating: \n10 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has \nthe burden of proving falsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, \ndoes not establish or prove an applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the \nomission occurred; and (c) a Judge must consider the record evidence as \na whole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial evidence \nconcerning the applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the omission \noccurred.  \nISCR Case No. 03-10390 at 8 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, 2005) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-23133 \n(App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004)). \nWhile Applicant might not be able to remember every single detail of his financial \nlife, especially pertaining to his federal income return filings and non-filings over a \nmultiyear period, it is clear that he should have been aware of his failure to timely file \nfederal income tax returns for such a lengthy multiyear period. His attorney\u2019s eventual \nacknowledgment on his behalf that Applicant\u2019s response was caused by his failure to \nproperly identify the material facts of the question because of his misunderstanding that \nthere was no filing requirement because his taxes were withheld by his employer is too \nsimplistic and inconsistent with Applicant\u2019s other excuses and explanations. His federal \nincome tax return non-filing record is unambiguous. AG \u00b6 16(a) has been established. \nThe guideline also includes an example of a condition that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from personal conduct under AG \u00b6 17: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts.  \nWhile Applicant\u2019s federal income tax return non-filing record response was made \non April 29, 2020, the issues related to those returns commenced in 2009 and continued \nuntil February 23, 2022. There was no mention of that record during his first OPM \ninterview, but it was eventually addressed during his second interview on May 18, 2020. \nApplicant\u2019s delayed action in reporting the accurate facts, under the circumstances \ncontinues to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \n\u00b6 17(a) has not been established. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent \n11 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nto which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. (See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d \n389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006)) \nThere is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant\u2019s financial concerns. \nApplicant is a 58-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving as a \nsenior engineering and operations support technician with his current employer since \nOctober 2015. He previously worked for the same employer as a senior tester (April 2015 \n\u2013 October 2015). He is a 1982 high school graduate, and he has received substantial \ncredits towards a bachelor\u2019s degree. He enlisted (with delayed entry in \n \n1982) in the U.S. \nNavy in January 1983, and served on active duty until January 1989, when he was \nhonorably discharged as a petty officer 1st  class (E-6). He transitioned into the inactive \nreserve upon his discharge and remained in that status until January 1995.  He has held \na secret clearance since 1983. He was married in 1986 and divorced in 2013. He has four \nchildren, born in 1984, 1993, 1997, and 1998. He eventually filed all of his delinquent \nfederal inco\n \nme tax returns and has made some payments for his delinquent taxes under \na proposed Installment Agreement with the IRS.  \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is simply more \nsubstantial. Applicant failed to timely file his federal income tax returns and make income \ntax payments for multiple tax years (the tax years 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, \n2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020). On December 15, 2021, well after he submitted \nhis SF 86 and after his OPM interview, he self-prepared and filed his federal income tax \nreturns for a multiyear period (2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020. As of \nFebruary 1, 2022 \u2013 the date of the SOR \u2013 only those long-overdue income tax returns had \nbeen filed. The remaining delinquent federal income tax returns (2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, \nand 2013) still had not been filed until February 23, 2022 \u2013 three weeks after the SOR \nwas issued. He also failed to pay an estimated $44,675 in federal income taxes for some \nof those years. Although he has claimed to have a proposed Installment Agreement, he \nhas failed to be in full compliance with the arrangements in that agreement. Also disturbing \nis the fact that when Applicant completed his SF 86, he responded to a particular question \npertaining to his financial record (\u201cIn the last seven (7) years have you failed to file or pay \nFederal, state, or other taxes when required by law or ordinance?\u201d). He answered \u201cno\u201d, a \nresponse that was clearly false. \nOverall, the evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I \n12 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                        \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nconclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his financial \nconsiderations.

Paragraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he is financially overextended and therefore potentially unreliable, untrustworthy, or at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. Applicant admitted all the allegations under this guideline. The SOR alleged that Applicant has seven debts that were charged-off, or in collection, in the total amount of approximately $54,468. (SOR 1.a through 1.g.) The existence and amount of these debts is supported by his admissions to all SOR allegations in his Answer. The debts are also confirmed by credit reports submitted by the Government dated August 18, 2020; March 30, 2021; and July 6, 2022. (Government Exhibits 7, 8, and 9.) The existence of the debts is also supported by Applicant\u2019s answers on Section 26 of his e-QIP (Government Exhibit 1) and during an interview with an investigator from the Office of Personnel Management on August 28, 2020. (Government Exhibit 2.) Applicant stated that he was unable to pay these debts, most of which date to the 2016/201",

Applicant admitted owing $14,365 for an automobile loan that was charged \noff. The vehicle was involved in a one-car accident and was totaled. Applicant has not \nmade any recent payments on this debt and has no current plans to make any payments \non this debt. (Tr. 38-40.) This debt is not resolved. \n1.c.

Applicant admitted \nallegations 2.a, 2.d, 2.e, and 2.f under this paragraph. He denied allegations 2.b and 2.c. \n2.a. Applicant admitted he left Company A\u2019s employment in May 2019. He was \nworking for a temporary personnel company (TPC) at that time, not for Company A. \nApplicant stated he had to miss a shift because he did not have a babysitter for his child \nand had to stay home. The TPC called Applicant and told him his services were no longer \nrequired. There is no allegation of misconduct, or evidence that Applicant is ineligible for \nrehire, in the record. (Government Exhibit 1 at Section 13A; Government Exhibit 2 at 2; \nGovernment Exhibit 4; Tr. 22-23.) \n2.b. Applicant denied that he was fired from Company B in about April 2019 for not \nbeing in camera view for 30 minutes at his assigned security guard post. He stated that \nhe was talking to his lead during this period of time. Shortly after talking to his lead he \nwas told to go home. The TPC that he actually worked for called and told him his services \nwere no longer required. There is no allegation of misconduct, or evidence that Applicant \nis ineligible for rehire, in the record. (Government Exhibit 1 at Section 13A; Government \nExhibit 2 at 3; Tr. 23-25.) \n2.c. Applicant denied that he was fired from employment with Company C in about \nJuly 2018 due to his alleged involvement in an attempted robbery. \nApplicant\u2019s employer at that time accused Applicant in a written statement to the \nOffice of Personnel Management of participating in an attempted robbery at his place of \nemployment. The employer stated that there was video evidence of Applicant\u2019s conduct \non the night in question, but the police \u201cwere not able to gather enough evidence to charge \n[Applicant].\u201d (Government Exhibit 3.) \nApplicant denied involvement in any attempted robbery. He did admit not properly \nlocking a door, and that allowed a person to enter the establishment and engage in a fight \nwith Applicant\u2019s employer. (Tr. 25-29.) \nApplicant submitted a letter from a person who knows both Applicant and his \nemployer at Company C. She worked with the employer in the past as his accountant. \nThe letter reads in part, \u201cI can state with first-hand knowledge that [employer] has perjured \nhimself in his letter [Government Exhibit 3] to you regarding [Applicant].\u201d After giving a \ntotally different version of the events in question that closely matches Applicant\u2019s \ntestimony she stated, \u201c[Employer] suffers from untreated mental disorders and should not \nbe utilized as a resource for a personal or professional reference.

I have seen him go on to seek a higher education while providing for his \nfamily with the utmost determination.\u201d \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personal security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAG \u00b6 19 describes two conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has seven debts that were charged-off, or in collection, in the total \namount of approximately $54,468. Each of these debts involved contracts for \ndiscretionary consumer purchases. He has not made any recent payments on these \ndebts, and has no current plans to make payments on these debts. These facts establish \nprima facie support for the foregoing disqualifying conditions, and shift the burden to \nApplicant to mitigate those concerns. \nThe guideline includes three conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s alleged financial difficulties: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn,\nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear\nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant has not mitigated the security significance of his past-due indebtedness. \nThese debts have been in existence for many years, and Applicant admitted making a \nconscious decision not to pay them so he can take care of his mother. While laudatory, \nthere is little to no evidence that Applicant has behaved responsibly under the \ncircumstances, as required by AG \u00b6 20(b). Applicant is fully aware of the impact \ndelinquent debt can have on his security clearance eligibility, but has not yet begun the \nwork to resolve the issue. None of the mitigating conditions are applicable to Applicant\u2019s \nsituation. Paragraph 1 is found against Applicant. \nParagraph 2 (Guideline E, Personal Conduct) \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for personal conduct are set out in \nAG \u00b6 15, which states: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes two conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information; and \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This \nincludes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n(1) untrustworthy, or unreliable behavior to include breach of client \nconfidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized \nrelease of sensitive corporate or government protected information; \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other employer\u2019s \ntime or resources. \nApplicant was let go from two temporary employments without allegations of \nmisconduct in 2019. He was accused by another employer of being involved in an \nattempted robbery in 2018. He also was cited three times in a period of seven months in \n2017 with serious state Vehicle Code violations. The above disqualifying conditions have \napplication to this case. \nThe guideline includes three conditions in AG \u00b6 17 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s conduct: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; and \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability. \nApplicant has mitigated the security significance of the incidents alleged in \nParagraph 2. With regard to allegations 2.a and 2.b, there is no evidence that Applicant \nengaged in work-related misconduct sufficient to raise any concerns under the \ndisqualifying conditions. Allegation 2.c was serious, but the statement by the police officer \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(Applicant Exhibit E), as supported by Applicant\u2019s own testimony and the statements in \nApplicant Exhibit B, strongly support application of mitigating condition AG \u00b6 17(f). Finally, \nApplicant has admitted that he drove in a reckless manner in 2017, but he has changed \nhis behavior and has changed his driving habits for the better. Accordingly, paragraph 2 \nof the SOR is found for Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s potential for national security eligibility by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a young man of \ntremendous potential. Since he decided to better himself, he has worked hard on his \neducation. This has allowed him to get a better job. However, he has not shown the same \nintensity with regard to resolving his financial situation. If he is able to get his finances \nunder control, he may be eligible for a security clearance in the future. He is not eligible \nnow because continuation of financial irresponsibility is likely, and the potential for \npressure or duress remains undimished. Overall, the record evidence creates substantial \ndoubt as to Applicant\u2019s present suitability for national security eligibility and a security \nclearance. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n                                                \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.g: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a through 2.f: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance.

On June 2, 2023, the Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was scheduled \nfor June 27, 2023. I convened the hearing on June 27, 2023, as scheduled. Government \nExhibits (GE) 1 through 17 and Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through K were admitted in \nevidence without objection. I kept the record open after the hearing to enable Applicant \nto submit documentary evidence. He timely submitted six exhibits, which were marked as \nAE L through Q and admitted without objection. The record closed on July 11, 2023. \nDOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on July 7, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 68 years old. He holds two bachelor\u2019s degrees. He earned them from \ndifferent U.S. universities. He married in 1981 and divorced 2020. The couple separated \nin 2015 and they initiated divorce proceedings in 2016. There was one child of the \nmarriage, who is now in her thirties and has developmental issues. Applicant remarried a \ncitizen of [Country C] in 2021 and he has a stepchild from this marriage, who recently \nturned 18. His current wife resides in a property he owns in [Country M] and he spends \nabout half of his time there. His stepchild also resides in his [Country M] property. His \ncurrent wife is a homemaker and both she and the stepchild are in the process of \nimmigrating to the United States. (Tr. at 20-23.) \nApplicant held his first security clearance in the mid-1980s. He held a security \nclearance for about 30 years when it lapsed in 2018 due to employment issues. His area \nof work involves negotiating international agreements. His work required international \ntravel. (Tr. at 27-31.) \nApplicant admits all of the Guideline J allegations with explanations, which are \ncross alleged under Guideline E, SOR 3.a. The Guideline J and cross alleged Guideline \nE allegations are supported by GE 1 \u2013 GE 4, GE 13, and GE 15 \u2013 GE 17. \nSOR 1.a, Applicant was charged in December 2015 with domestic violence and a \nprotective order was issued against him. In his Answer, he admits the allegation and he states \nan attorney advised his wife to file a protective order against him in retaliation for him filing \none against his wife the day prior. (GE 2; Tr. at 46-47, 110.) \nSOR 1.b, Applicant was charged in June 2016 with driving under the influence (DUI) \nand convicted of DUI in August 2016. He cites as mitigation that he has not had another \nincident in the past six years. (GE 3.; Tr. at 56-57.) \nSOR 1.c, Applicant was arrested in November 2016 for driving on a suspended \nlicense and pled guilty to the offense in 2017. (GE 4.) He offered an explanation in his \nAnswer that the interlock system was unreliable, so in October 2016 he decided to \u201ctake \na period of license suspension in its place.\u201d There is no evidence in the record he \n2 \n\n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nrequested a license suspension, but he admits that in November 2016 he drove to his \ncondominium to prevent his ex-wife from taking his remaining personal belongings, \nincluding roughly $10,000 in gold and silver bars. (Tr. at 62, 64.) He was subsequently \ncited for driving on a suspended license. He offered in his Answer that his concern was \njustified because he later had his ex-wife charged for breaking into the condominium, but \nhe then dropped the charges on the basis he felt sorry for his ex-wife. \nSOR 1.d, a warrant for Applicant\u2019s arrest was issued in June 2018, in [State N], for \nfelony extradition as a fugitive from another state. He was unaware at the time he was \ntraveling that a warrant had been issued. He had to return to the United States from \nCountry M to accept the charges. The charges were dismissed without leave in July 2018 \nwhen he turned himself in to the seeking state. (GE 15 at 4, 8.) As an explanation in his \nAnswer, he denies he fled the country to avoid trial on charges of altering documents \nrelated to property in Country M, as his ex-wife claimed, and had only gone to [Country \nM] to deal with their property in Country M. He acknowledges he was convicted of felony \nfraud but notes he did receive the property in Country M in divorce. (Tr. at 65-74.) \nSOR 1.e, Applicant was charged in 2018 with felony fraud and received probation \nbefore judgment. In his Answer he explains he entered an Alford plea and received a \n$150 fine, 40 hours of community service, and an agreement the matter would be \nexpunged, which it was. (GE 13 at 1-3; AE I; AE J; and AE K.) He states he would now \nhave contested the charges had he known they would be discoverable in the security \nclearance application process. (Tr. at 69-70; GE 15 at 1.) \nApplicant admits all of the Guideline F allegations with explanations, which are \ncross alleged under Guideline E, SOR 3.a. The Guideline F and cross alleged Guideline \nE allegations are supported by GE 1, GE 2, and GE 9 \u2013 GE 12. \nUnder Guideline F, the Government alleged that, as of March 2017, Applicant filed \nfive bankruptcy petitions. He filed two Chapter 13 bankruptcy petitions. The first in March \n2017 (SOR 2.b; GE 6), and the second in November 2017 (SOR 2.c; GE 7). The March \n2017 filing was dismissed in October 2017 for failing to complete required forms and the \nNovember 2017 filing was dismissed for failure to attend a meeting of creditors. He filed \nthree Chapter 7 bankruptcy petitions. The first in November 2003 (SOR 2.a; GE 5) \ninvolved about $90,000 of debt, which was discharged in February 2005. (Tr. at 78.) He \nnoted he was granted a top-secret clearance in 2005 with a bankruptcy on his record. \nThe second in February 2018 (SOR 2.d; GE 8.), which was dismissed in April 2018 for \nfailure to provide the required documents, had issues surrounding the signatures \ninvolving the application. (Tr. at 84-90.) The third in November 2018 (SOR 2.e; GE 9), \nwas discharged in February 2019.

The \nfirst court action (SOR 2.f) was a judgment in the amount of $72,600 entered against him \nfor wrongfully converting funds held for his disabled adult daughter. (GE 10 at 3; GE 14 \nat 19; AE K at 16.) He admits the allegation and acknowledges comingling her accounts \nwith his investment accounts and that he sustained losses he could not cover.

He is saving money to be able to pay off this debt. \n(Tr. at 96-97, 99-100.) The second court action (SOR 2.g) involves unpaid alimony of \n$96,000. (GE 14 at 2, 19.) AE K states his former spouse was granted an amount of \n$147,500 and any unpaid amount would be converted into a monetary judgment. (AE K \nat 16.) The SOR alleges a $96,000 alimony award. In his Answer he admits the allegation \nand offers that all \u201calimony including all back alimony is being faithfully paid in accordance \nwith the court order. (Answer at 5; Tr. at 103.) \nApplicant admits SOR 2.h, which declares despite his financial situation alleged in \nSOR 2.a through 2.g, he provided approximately $54,000 in financial support to foreign \nnationals he dated between 2015 and 2020. In his Answer he explains that after he \nseparated, he worked through a marriage service which specialized in placing American \nmen with foreign women. He notes he had two long-term relationships, the second of \nwhich resulted in marriage, and that he was working \u201cthe majority of time\u201d and could afford \nto help support these women. (Answer at 6; Tr. at 106.) \nApplicant did not admit or deny the Guideline E allegation in his Answer. He did \nadmit to allegations that comprised SOR 3.a. I applied those facts discussed above to the \nGuideline E allegation, which I consider as a denial based on his nonresponse. \nApplicant in his Answer and testimony attributed the allegations in the SOR directly \nor indirectly to events surrounding his divorce from his wife of 34 years. He described the \ndivorce as a \u201cfive-year acrimonious, destructive, intense, bitter, and litigious divorce.\u201d (Tr. \nat 14.) He insists he has changed his circumstances for the better now that he is no longer \nin a bad marriage and has happily remarried. (Answer; Tr. at 102.) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02- \n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01- \n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \nAnalysis \nCriminal Conduct \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n                   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence admitted into evidence \nestablish the following disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 31: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nI also have considered the following AG \u00b6 32 mitigating conditions: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nApplicant\u2019s last instance of criminal conduct was in 2018. Despite his claims that \nhis misconduct occurred under the stress of his divorce his conduct demonstrates his \nwillingness to act for his own benefit despite the illegality of his conduct. I conclude he \nhas not shown rehabilitation with respect to his criminal conduct. The security concerns \nunder this guideline are not mitigated. \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.d are mitigated. SOR 1.a involves a civil matter and SOR \n1.d was a procedural matter, which was resolved by the underlying criminal matter.   \nFinancial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information.

It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence admitted into evidence \nestablish the following disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; \n(d) deceptive or illegal financial practices such as embezzlement, employee theft, check \nfraud, expense account fraud, mortgage fraud, filing deceptive loan statements and other \nintentional financial breaches of trust; and \n(e) consistent spending beyond one's means or frivolous or irresponsible \nspending, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant \nnegative cash flow, a history of late payments or of non-payment, or other \nnegative financial indicators. \nApplicant\u2019s bankruptcies in 2003 and 2019 arose from an inability to manage \npersonal finances. He converted his daughter\u2019s financial accounts as a result of failed \ninvestments on his part. Available information shows that Applicant has been unable to \nprudently manage his finances in a way that would indicate sound judgment and reliability. \nI also have considered the following pertinent mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n           \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply because Applicant\u2019s financial problems are recent and \nongoing and have recurred over a long period of time. I considered AG \u00b6 20(c) in the \ncontext of compliance with court orders. While this is positive information, in light of \nApplicant\u2019s history of debt and bankruptcy, it is too soon to conclude that his financial \nproblems are under control. \nAs to AG \u00b6 20(b), Applicant blames his ex-wife spending for the 2003 bankruptcy. \nHis 2019 bankruptcy arose from his divorce and invokes the first prong of that mitigating \ncondition. Full application of this AG \u00b6 20(b) is not possible, because he did not act \nresponsibly under the circumstances given his actions involving his daughter\u2019s account \nand financial support to foreign nationals. In conjunction with my consideration of AG \u00b6 \n20(d), I conclude Applicant\u2019s repeated resort to bankruptcy protection does not constitute \nresponsible action in response to financial problems. Nor does it support his claim that he \ninitiated prompt, good-faith efforts to pay or otherwise resolve his debts. Applicant did not \nshow that he has embarked on a systematic, reliable effort to improve his financial \nmanagement in a way that inspires some confidence that he will not experience financial \nproblems in the future given his actions involving his daughter\u2019s financial account and his \nfinancial support to foreign nationals. Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns \nabout his finances. \nPersonal Conduct \nThe Government\u2019s information about Applicant\u2019s history of criminal conduct and \nfinancial considerations also reasonably raised a broader security concern about \nApplicant\u2019s overall judgment, trustworthiness, and reliability thus establishing the security \nconcern articulated, in relevant part, at AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. \nMore specifically, Applicant\u2019s admissions and the Government\u2019s evidence requires \napplication of the disqualifying condition at AG \u00b6 16(e): \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing; \n(2) while in another country, engaging in any activity that is illegal in \nthat country; \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(3) while in another country, engaging in any activity that, while legal \nthere, is illegal in the United States. \nApplicant\u2019s repeated instances of criminal conduct over the past seven years, and \nhis lack of discretion in handling his finances and the use of his disabled daughter\u2019s \nfinancial account as a means to resolve his financial challenges undermine confidence in \nApplicant\u2019s judgment. His conduct was of sufficient concern he was charged with criminal \noffenses. \nOf the mitigating conditions listed at AG \u00b6 17, only AG \u00b6 17(c) is pertinent to this \ncase: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \nAs to Applicant\u2019s conduct, one instance involved breaching his obligations to his \ndisabled daughter. Additionally, it was related to his long history of poor management of \nhis personal finances, which themselves remain a security concern. Because Applicant \ndid not mitigate the security concerns about his criminal conduct, I conclude he also has \nnot mitigated the related, broader concerns about his poor judgment and inability or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and procedures. Available information does not show that \nApplicant\u2019s poor decision making will not recur. On balance, he has not mitigated the \nsecurity concerns under this guideline. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                              \n                    \n                  \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case.

Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on May 21, 2020. On \nFebruary 11, 2022, the Department of Defense (DoD) sent her a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline F. The DoD acted under Executive \nOrder (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by the DoD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on April 29, 2022, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on June 23, 2022, \nand the case was assigned to me on March 8, 2023. On March 21, 2023, the Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was scheduled \nfor May 16, 2023. I convened the hearing as scheduled.

At the conclusion of the hearing, I kept the record open to \ngive Applicant the chance to submit documentation, and she timely submitted Applicant\u2019s \nExhibits (AE) A through J, which were admitted without objection. DOHA received the \ntranscript (Tr.) on May 23, 2023. The record closed on May 30, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted, SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b, alleging delinquent student loans totaling \n$31,778. She denied SOR \u00b6 1.c, a delinquent telecommunications account, on the basis \nthat she had resolved the debt. \nApplicant is 46 years old. She was married from 1996 to 2001 and has two adult \nchildren who are twins. She earned her bachelor\u2019s degree in 2008 and her master\u2019s \ndegree in 2010. (Tr. at 27.) Between 2014 and 2015 she studied part-time for a certificate \nbut did not receive it. (Tr. at 29.) She has been employed full-time since 2008. According \nto her security clearance application she has worked for her security clearance sponsor \nsince 2010 and was previously investigated for a security clearance in 2004. (GE 1 at 15, \n48 and Tr. at 29-31.) \nApplicant elected to go into default in order to qualify for credit repair programs. \nShe was supporting her two children. (GE 1 at 23.) She wanted to ensure that her children \ndid not end up in debt. One child graduated from college and the other is fully employed \nin a trade. Her children did not qualify as full dependents, because her children lived in \nanother state. She provided documentation showing her income between 2015 and 2021. \nHer annual income in 2015 was $50,126. (AE A.) Her wages from her employer in 2018 \nwere over $67,000. (AE B.) Her total wages in 2021 were $84,721. (AE C.) She is now \nmaking over $100,000. (Tr. 72.) \nApplicant resided in a home she owned from 2009 until 2014, when she moved to \na new state. She moved again after a year to the state she now resides. She moved to \nher current location in 2020, in hopes of earning a salary that would enable her to cover \nher student loan payments. (GE 1 at 9-11.) Her $88,000 salary was insufficient for the \nmetro area she was living in. She found herself choosing between paying her rent, food \nexpenses, and commuting costs or paying $700 in student loan debt each month. (Tr. at \n20.) To improve her financial situation, she started a cleaning business in 2021. The start-\nup expenses to buy the franchise required her to put $2,000 down, and then finance the \nremainder. The finance costs are covered in the monthly income that business brings in. \nThe first year was not profitable. (Tr. at 61, 77-81.) Between her salary and her cleaning \nbusiness income, Applicant makes approximately $6,200 a month. She maintains a \n\u201cloose budget.\u201d (Tr at 62-67, 72.) With a recent raise she has roughly $2,000 left over \nafter expenses. (Tr. at 72.) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-b: two education loans placed for collection in the amounts of \n$19,873 and $11,905.

(GE 3 at 2.) In Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, she admitted the \ndebts. In her Answer she stated these debts were covered by the \u201cCARES ACT of 2020\u201d \nwhich negated the SOR allegations. She testified her loans went into default right at the \ntime that the pandemic occurred. (Tr at 21.) She states this is \u201cwhen the President came \nand put student loans on forbearance and froze. So I am not in default at this time.\u201d (Tr. \nat 21.) She added her student loans did not need to be repaid until this past year and that \nshe has made steps to mitigate and to be prepared to pay when the freeze is lifted. (Tr at \n21.) She stated she was applying for another program that would wipe away her debt, \nbecause under her master's degree, she had been told that her degree was going to make \nsome money for her. (Tr. at 31.) She stated she pursued the additional certificate because \nit was her understanding repayment of the loans could be deferred while attending school \neven part-time. She acknowledged she did not have any documentation to support this \ntestimony. (Tr. at 33.) \nIn her post hearing narrative, she stated had made payments towards the debt \nprior to the student loan repayment freeze citing two Department of Education (DoEd) \nStudent Loan Interest Statements she had included in her post hearing submission. (AE \nD and AE E.) The statement for calendar year 2019 shows she paid $6,476.07 in interest \nand the statement for calendar year 2020 show she paid $1,767.28 in interest. (AE D and \nAE E.) She stated these exhibits rebutted the narrative painted by the Government that \nshe had neglected her responsibilities. (AE J at 1.) \nI have taken  administrative notice that in March 2020, as a result of the COVID-\n19 pandemic, the President directed the DoEd to provide the following temporary relief \non DoEd owned federal student loans: suspension of loan payments, stopped collections \non defaulted loans, and a 0% interest rate. On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, \nRelief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) provided for the above relief measures \nthrough September 30, 2020. See Federal Student Aid (FSA) website, ISCR Case No. \n20-02787 at 3 n.1 (App. Bd. Mar. 2022). This student loan debt relief has been extended \nseveral times. See https://studentaid.gov/announcements-events/covid-19. \nAfter the SOR was issued she applied for the one-time student loan debt relief plan \nannounced by the President on August 24, 2022. The DoEd issued an email to her on \nNovember 19, 2022, stating she had been approved for the program. (AE F.) A week prior \nto the hearing she \u201cstumbled\u201d upon an article about the Fresh Start Program and applied. \n(Tr. at 81.) The DoEd issued a letter on May 16, 2023, the same day as the hearing, \nreiterating that her delinquent student loans would soon be transferred to a new loan \nservicer and will no longer be in default. Once the payment pause ends her new loan \nservicer would send her a monthly bill and she would be required to make monthly \npayments. (AE G.) According to the letter, because these loans became delinquent more \nthan seven years ago the new loan servicer will not report the new status of the loans to \ncredit reporting agencies. (GE 3 at 2 and AE G.) \nSince her student loans were assigned for collection, she traveled to Europe in \n2020, Canada in 2018, a Caribbean island in 2017, Africa in 2015, Mexico in 2015, and \na Caribbean island in 2014.

(Tr. at 74-\n75.)  \nSOR \u00b6 1.c: telecommunication account placed for collection in the amount \nof $211. Applicant denied the allegation on basis she had \u201c\u2026a zero-dollar balance on the \nold account and [her] account is current.\u201d Her Answer included an email from the company \nstating, \u201cThanks for being our customer. Upon clearance of the payment, this account will \nbe considered paid in full.\u201d She explained the delinquency was caused by equipment she \nturned in prior to her move that was not scanned properly by the staff, so it was marked \nas not being received and she was not aware of the problem until the security clearance \nprocess. One week after the hearing the company issued an email to her stating they had \nreceived her notification of dispute and reviewed the information she had provided. The \ncompany determined the account had been satisfied. (AE I.) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are established by the evidence: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant's federal student loans were assigned to collection beginning in 2014. A \nsecurity clearance represents an obligation to the Federal Government for the protection \nof national secrets. Accordingly, failure to honor other obligations to the Government has \na direct bearing on an applicant's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified information. See ISCR Case No. 14-03358 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2015). While \nher student loans may no longer be considered delinquent since March 2020 because of \nthe COVID-19 deferment, that action does not excuse previously delinquent student loans \nsuch as these. See ISCR Case No. 20-01527 at 2 (App. Bd. June 7, 2021). The above \nlisted conditions are made applicable to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b, thereby shifting the burden \nto Applicant to provide evidence in mitigation. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20.

She has established a repayment agreement. Prior to \nthe SOR being issued she had made interest payments mitigating her past inaction. She \nhas been employed since 2008. It is well-established that the timing of debt payments is \na relevant consideration for a judge to deliberate whether an applicant has acted in a \nreasonable and responsible manner in addressing financial problems. For example, to \nreceive full credit under Mitigating Condition 20(d), an applicant must initiate and adhere \n\u201cto a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d Directive, \nEncl. 2, App. Her actions prior to the SOR and recent actions to resolve the student loans \ndebts entitle her to mitigating credit. See ISCR Case No. 08-06058 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. \n21, 2009). Her employment history shows a steady upward trajectory of improved income, \nand she has added to it by establishing her own business. Her interest payments \ncoincided with an increase in salaried income. She has made a good-faith effort to pay or \nresolve her debts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and 20(d) apply. \nFor AG \u00b6 20(b) to be applicable, Applicant must also provide sufficient evidence \nthat she acted responsibly under the circumstances. Her post hearing submissions show \nshe had made interest payments prior to the SOR being issued. While her student loans \nremained unpaid, she took expensive international vacations instead of addressing her \nfinancial responsibilities. She chose to fund her children\u2019s post high school education. \nThese conditions were not beyond her control. Her children are now out of school. She \nhas maintained employment since 2008. Her income has increased as she addressed a \nmitigating concern of underemployment. While she may not have immediately addressed \nher student loan debt as more disposable income became available, she did address her \nstudent loans with over $8,000 in interest payments prior to the COVID related debt relief \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n         Subparagraphs 1.a-c: \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \noptions, and she has sought to improve her financial situation by starting her own \nbusiness. AG \u00b6 20(b) applies. \nApplicant does not present a perfect case in mitigation, but perfection is not \nrequired. Under the limited circumstances of this case, I find that her finances no longer \ngenerate questions about her judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified information. Security concerns about her finances are mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Overall, the record evidence leaves me \nwithout questions or doubts about Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. I conclude Applicant mitigated the financial considerations security concerns \nand refuted the personal conduct security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nFor Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance.

Applicant completed his security clearance application on January 29, 2021. (Item 2) He reported no military service. He has had a security clearance since 2007. (Item 2) FINANCIAL The SOR alleges that Applicant has six delinquent debts, with approximately $112,000 in delinquencies. He disclosed that he incurred major business losses. He was earning $600,000, but due to the downturn in the economy, his income adjusted down to $200,000. (Item 3) He paid his employees and maintained his contractual obligation. He took no income from the business and lived on his social security. The loss of income was not due to any behavioral irresponsibility on subject\u2019s part. (Item 3) Applicant attributes his financial situation to a large reduction in personal income due to business losses. His business did not survive. The Covid pandemic exacerbated his financial distress, which delayed the sale of his home in October 2020. His income in 2020 was $20,000 and increased to $138,720 in 2021.

Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn March 11, 2022, in accordance with Department of Defense (DOD) Directive \n5220.6, as amended (Directive), the DOD issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) alleging facts that raise security concerns under Guideline F. (Item 1) The action \nwas taken under Executive Order (Exec.

He was \nearning $600,000, but due to the downturn in the economy, his income adjusted down to \n$200,000. (Item 3) He paid his employees and maintained his contractual obligation. He \ntook no income from the business and lived on his social security. The loss of income \nwas not due to any behavioral irresponsibility on subject\u2019s part. (Item 3) \n Applicant attributes his financial situation to a large reduction in personal income \ndue to business losses. His business did not survive. The Covid pandemic exacerbated \nhis financial distress, which delayed the sale of his home in October 2020. His income in \n2020 was $20,000 and increased to $138,720 in 2021. Applicant sold his house, cut his \nexpenses, and paid the account in \u00b61.d in full.  (Item 3) He moved into his wife\u2019s home in \nanother state, which is from a family trust. He also sold an apartment for $950,000. (Item \n3) He used the profits for living expenses. He was not able to make payments on bills. \n(Item 3) \nAs to SOR allegation \u00b6 1.a, an account that was charged off in the approximate \namount of $26,748, Applicant submitted a Settlement Stipulation. He submitted \ndocumentation that he has made a $10,000 payment on March 22, 2022 and five \nadditional payments of $750 ahead of the due date. He has five remaining payments. The \nremaining balance is $3,750. (Response to FORM at 2) \nAs to SOR allegation \u00b6 1.b, a charged-off mortgage account in the amount of \n$24,997, this has been paid. It was for the home sold in 2020. \nAs to SOR allegation 1.c, a charged-off credit card account in the amount of \n$21,561, Applicant has offered a settlement, but it has not been approved. (Response to \nFORM) \nAs to SOR allegation 1.d, a charged-off account in the amount of $17,413, \nApplicant settled this debt for $12,000 with a payment plan.

He has paid other non-SOR debts in the meantime. He has paid a total \nof $43,172.58 in payments toward his debts. (Response to FORM) He included \ndocumentation in the Response to FORM.

He has been \ntaking action to ameliorate the delinquent debts due to the business downturn. He \nreceived financial counseling and his credit report from 2022 shows accounts as \u201cpays as \nagreed.\u201d (Item 4) \nHis gross annual income is now about $125,000. His income after expenses is \nabout $3,000 to $4,000 a month. He is using this money to build reserves in case of \nanother business downturn. (Item 4) He is paying on another credit card listed in his credit \nreport. \nApplicant has paid, settled or is making progress toward his delinquent debts. He \nhas presented sufficient evidence to mitigate the financial consideration concerns. He is \nworking on a plan. \n. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture.  \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants national security eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or \nsensitive information. Finally, as emphasized in Section 7 of EO \n10865, \u201cAny \ndetermination under this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information.

May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, corroborated by his credit reports, establish two \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d), and \nAG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). \nThe security concerns raised in the SOR may be mitigated by any of the following \npotentially applicable factors: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; and \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant\u2019s financial issues began with huge business losses and the pandemic in \n2020. It delayed the sale of his home until 2020. His income in 2020 was $20,000. He \nnow has a stable income. He sold a home and an apartment to meet living expenses and \npay debts. He reduced his debt by $70,000 in the past ten months. Applicant has made \nsubstantial efforts to resolve his delinquent debts. For these reasons, I find SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \nthrough f. for Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \napplicable guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person. \nAn administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \n\u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis, \nand I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline F, and Applicant\u2019s devotion to his country, I \nconclude that Applicant has presented sufficient mitigation.

He was attempting to use a program that would allow him to \ntransfer from active duty to the reserve. He appeared desperate to use any means to \nget off active duty. He reported that he often became so angry that he could feel his \ntemperature rise. He was provided an anger management notebook and given \nhomework. He did not complete the assigned homework. He did not appear for two \nappointments, and a termination note was completed in March 2015.

His wife removed all weapons from the \nhome. He thought that inpatient psychiatric treatment would be helpful to him. He was \nvoluntarily admitted to a civilian inpatient psychiatric hospital the next day on June 10, \n2015. (Tr. at 39-42, 68-70, 75, 77; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1-3; AE B) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nInpatient Treatment \nApplicant was an inpatient at a civilian psychiatric hospital from June 10, 2015, to \nJune 22, 2015. His discharge diagnosis was major depressive disorder (MDD), single \nepisode, moderate to severe, with mild psychotic symptoms; posttraumatic stress \ndisorder (PTSD); generalized anxiety disorder (GAD); insomnia secondary to \ndepression and anxiety; partner relational problems, moderate; and job-related \nproblems. (Tr. at 41-42, 70; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 4, 5; AE B, K) \nApplicant was prescribed medication at the hospital and for his aftercare. The \nhospital reported: \nIn combination with individual, group, and milieu activities his mood and \noutlook significantly improved. He was very much engaged in treatment, \nand by discharge he was no longer having any further depressive, \nsuicidal, or homicidal ideations. He was compliant with medications and \nhad no side effects. His aftercare was coordinated with [military base} \nrepresentatives. (GE 5) \n \n \nMilitary Behavioral Health Center \nApplicant received treatment at the military behavioral health center after his \ndischarge from the civilian hospital. (Tr. at 43-44, 73) His medical records show the \nfollowing clinical impression/summary: \nThe patient voluntarily presented for medication management after recent \nhospitalization for depression, anxiety, and nightmares. He was diagnosed \nwith MDD, GAD, and PTSD at the inpatient facility; however, the patient \ndoes not spontaneously offer sufficient symptoms to meet criteria for \nPTSD or GAD. Further, the depressive symptoms he reports appear to be \ndirectly tied to work-related stress, and the patient has previously divulged \na belief that his symptoms would be entirely resolved if he were removed \nfrom the work environment. Psychological testing has demonstrated \nsymptom exaggeration and/or feigning on tests (SIMS, MMPI [invalid due \nto over-endorsement], MCMI [valid but demonstrated over-endorsement]). \nDiagnostically, these results complicate the clinical picture and render it \ndifficult to determine what, if anything, he endorses can or should be \ntargeted by treatment. The patient continues to maintain that his report is \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nan accurate portrayal of his symptoms. At this stage, it is my clinical \nopinion that the patient likely does experience some degree of \npsychological distress, but it appears that this distress is the result of poor \ncoping and maladaptive personality features (affective instability, \ninappropriate and intense anger, recurrent suicidality). He was started on \nhis current medication regimen while inpatient. We will continue these \nmedications for now, as we continue to gather data and determine what \nsymptoms are truly present and amenable to treatment. Regarding the \npersonality features, it is likely that the use of quetiapine can target anxiety \nand sleep disturbance, and prazosin can decrease autonomic arousal. We \nwill add a small daytime dose to see if this alleviates his endorsement of \nsignificant daytime hyperarousal. Other medication changes will be \ndeferred until diagnostic clarity can be attained. He does not present with \nacute safety concerns and is appropriate for outpatient management. (GE \n3) \nThe DSM-5 diagnoses were unspecified personality disorder, malingering, and \nrule out adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood. Under the risk \nassessment section, which primarily dealt with suicide and homicide, the medical record \nreported: \nHospitalization is not deemed necessary at this time, as the patient does \nnot present a clear or imminent danger to self or others. There is no \ncurrent indication for pursuing a higher level of care. Outpatient \nmanagement is currently most appropriate and least restrictive level of \ncare. The patient is deemed to be a reliable reporter and is competent to \nmake healthcare decisions. (emphasis in original) (GE 3) \nThe last prognosis in the medical records in evidence was provided on July 30, \n2015, \u201cPrognosis: Guarded, prognosis depends on diagnostic clarification and will be \nworsened by lack of candor.\u201d (GE 3) \nApplicant went on terminal leave shortly after the last entry. He was honorably \ndischarged as an E-4. The reason for the discharge was reduction in force because of \nhis rank and time in service. He has a 100% disability rating from the Department of \nVeterans Affairs (VA). (Tr. at 34, 45, 67, 74-75, 81; GE 1, 2; AE B, F) \n \nVA Treatment \nApplicant worked in Afghanistan from about January 2016 to June 2016. He \nreturned to Afghanistan in about July 2016. From 2016 to 2018, he worked in \nAfghanistan seven times. He has received counseling and treatment from the VA since \n2016. Applicant stated that it is for PTSD, anxiety, and depression. He would see the \ntherapist when he was in the United States. The VA reported that he was seen for a \ntotal of 32 visits from August 2018 to September 2019 for PTSD-related issues. His \ntreatment at that facility concluded because he moved to another state.

(Tr. at \n52AE J, M, O) The VA psychiatrist reported: \nAgain, he has shown consistency while dutifully fulfilling his obligations as \na patient. This includes good attendance with scheduled appointments, \nbeing truthful and forthcoming when expressing his concerns, and \ncooperating and adhering to the agreed-upon treatment plan. Throughout \nthis time, he has not demonstrated any disruptive behaviors to myself or \nclinic staff. [Applicant] has been a model patient in our clinic. (AE N) \nApplicant stated that his mental health is stable. He sees the VA psychiatrist \nonce a month. He takes his medication. He has coping mechanisms, such as going to \nthe gym, listening to music and going to the dog park. He finds it helpful to talk with a \nfriend who was also a sensor operator. The friend understands what they dealt with. He \ncredibly stated that he will seek additional help if he needs it. (Tr. at 55, 58-63, 78-79, \n82) \nDOD CAF Psychological Evaluation - July 2021 \nThe DOD CAF requested that Applicant undergo a psychological evaluation. The \nevaluation was conducted on July 16, 2021, by a licensed psychologist (hereinafter \nreferred to as psychologist or DOD CAF psychologist) who was contracted from private \npractice by the DOD CAF. A report of the evaluation was prepared on July 26, 2021. \n(GE 7) \nThe psychologist utilized a clinical interview, self-report questionnaires, \nstructured personality assessment (Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2 \nRestructured Form-MMPI-2-RF), and medical records. The psychologist indicated that \nApplicant \u201cexhibited a pattern of responding that raises questions regarding validity of \nthe results,\u201d and that Applicant \u201cproduced a profile that shows evidence of inconsistent \nresponding and over-reporting of symptoms throughout the protocol.\u201d (GE 7) \nThe psychologist found that based on Applicant\u2019s \u201cpresentation and recent \nhistory, his judgment and impulse control were good. But there is some evidence to \nsuggest a history of difficulties with judgment and impulse control.\u201d The diagnostic \nimpression was: \nClinical interview, review of his medical records, and self-report \nquestionnaires, indicate inconsistencies regarding the presence or \nabsence of current psychiatric symptoms. Review of his completed MMPI-\n2-RF shows [Applicant] answered all questions on the assessment \nmeasure, but exhibited a pattern of responding that raises questions \nregarding validity of the results. [Applicant] produced a profile that shows \nevidence of inconsistent responding and over-reporting of symptoms \nthroughout the protocol. While there are elevations on a number of clinical \nscales, including somatic/cognitive dysfunction, emotional dysfunction, \nthought dysfunction, interpersonal functioning scales and interest scales, \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthere is sufficient evidence to suggest these results are invalid and not \ninterpretable at this time. Of note, this pattern of inconsistent responding \nand over-reporting of symptoms is consistent throughout a number of \nrecords and may be reflective of a personality disorder or other chronic \ndisorder; additional evaluation is recommended if [Applicant] would be \ninterested in treatment to address these concerns. \nRegarding [Applicant\u2019s] self-report questionnaires, there is evidence to \nsuggest the presence of psychiatric symptoms. However, based on the \nresults of the validity scales of the MMPI-2-RF indicating inconsistent \nresponding and over-reporting of symptoms, the accuracy of [Applicant\u2019s] \nself-report measures should be interpreted with caution. . . . Based on his \nMMPI-2-RF and self-report measures, [Applicant] does appear to be \nexperiencing clinical distress, but due to questions regarding validity and \ninconsistency between the clinical interview and self-report measures, a \nspecific diagnostic impression is not available at this time. (GE 7) \nIn the summary and prognosis section, the psychologist wrote: \nAs a result of the above assessment, it is the undersigned clinician\u2019s \nopinion that [Applicant\u2019s] judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness are not \nappropriately intact, as evidenced by inconsistencies in the clinical \ninterview, self-report measures, patient history, and review of records. \nBased on a review of National Security Adjudicative Guidelines and DoD \nPersonnel Security Policy, there is evidence to suggest [Applicant] \ndisplays a pattern of being unreliable with his behavior, which would \nimpair his judgment, reliability, and ability to properly safeguard classified \nnational security information. It is recommended [Applicant] engage in a \nthorough personality assessment to determine the presence or absence of \ncharacterological conditions and engage in evidence-based treatment to \naddress his difficulties with self and others. (GE 7) \nThe psychologist then listed as the DSM-5 diagnosis, \u201cUnspecified Personality \nDisorder.\u201d (GE 7) \nApplicant\u2019s Psychological Evaluation - February 2022 \nApplicant sought his own evaluation from a licensed clinical psychologist \n(hereinafter psychologist or Applicant\u2019s psychologist) in February 2022. The diagnoses \nwere posttraumatic stress disorder, chronic; generalized anxiety disorder; and \ndependent, compulsive, and avoidant personality traits. The psychologist provided the \nfollowing diagnostic impressions: \n[Applicant] reports a history of multiple mood disorders, including \ndepression, bipolar disorder (unknown type), anxiety, and PTSD. There is \nalso a past diagnosis of unspecified personality disorder; however, the \napplicant feels this was a misdiagnosis and the problematic traits were \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nactually symptoms of untreated bipolar disorder. He stated that he is now \nbeing treated effectively for bipolar disorder by a psychiatrist. \n \nBased on my clinical interview of the applicant, it is plausible that he \nsuffers from manic depression; however, his insomnia may have also \nbeen due to other factors, including varied work shifts, nightmares, \nanxiety, and other symptoms of PTSD. During this examination, he did not \ndescribe any manic behaviors, other than insomnia. His psychological test \nresults do not suggest bipolar disorder, but do indicate a moderate level of \nongoing anxiety. Dependent, compulsive, and avoidant personality traits \nare also noted on the MCMI-IV, which may be the traits implied by other \nclinicians under the vague diagnosis of \u201cunspecified personality disorder.\u201d \nStill, it should be noted that I have not reviewed those providers\u2019 records. \nRegardless of the exact diagnoses in this case, it is apparent that \n[Applicant\u2019s] symptoms are largely under control with his current \nmedication regimen, even while working in the same field that led to his \ninitial psychiatric treatment. He is aware of his chronic mental health \nissues, and acknowledges that he will require ongoing medicinal \ntreatment. He indicated that is open to returning to therapy, if needed. He \nstated that he is asymptomatic at this time and has a good social support \nsystem. His home life is stable now that he is divorced and he has custody \nof his children. He maintained that he will remain compliant with any and \nall treatment modalities, as needed. He does not feel he needs counseling \nat this time.  \nEmpirical data suggest that individuals with chronic mood disorders and \npersonality \ndisorders \nshould \nremain \nin \ncare \n(therapy \nand/or \npharmacotherapy) as long as symptomatic. If [Applicant] follows these \nguidelines, my clinical opinion in this case is that he would have a fair \nprognosis. (AE L) \nCharacter Evidence \nApplicant is active in his children\u2019s lives, and he volunteers in his community, \nincluding coaching youth sports. He called witnesses and submitted documents and \nletters attesting to his excellent work performance, strong moral character, and mental \nstability. He is praised for his trustworthiness, reliability, judgment, honesty, work ethic, \nprofessionalism, loyalty, adherence to security rules, and integrity.

Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline I: Psychological Conditions \nThe security concern for psychological conditions is set out in AG \u00b6 27: \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair \njudgment, reliability, or trustworthiness.

AG \u00b6 28(c) is established by the \ninpatient hospitalization. \nAG \u00b6 28(b) requires 1) an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional \nthat the individual has a condition; and 2) that the condition may impair judgment, \nstability, reliability, or trustworthiness. Some conditions, such as schizophrenia and \ndelusional disorder (not present in this case), clearly impair judgment, stability, \nreliability, and trustworthiness, and can be accepted as such without further elaboration \nby the mental health professional. Other conditions may require elaboration by the \nmental health professional as to how the condition may impair the individual\u2019s judgment, \nstability, reliability, or trustworthiness. \nMajor depressive disorder and PTSD are conditions that may impair judgment, \nstability, reliability, or trustworthiness. AG \u00b6 28(b) is established by those diagnoses.

As indicated above, receiving mental health treatment does not raise a \nsecurity concern. The allegation does not allege \u201can opinion by a duly qualified mental \nhealth professional that the individual has a condition that may impair judgment, \nstability, reliability, or trustworthiness.\u201d (AG \u00b6 28(b)) Instead, it alleges that Applicant \ndescribed the concerns as PTSD. It alleges that he \u201cdiscontinued treatment in about \nSeptember 2019 due to [his] relocation, but indicated [he] would resume services \nfollowing [his] move.\u201d That does not constitute \u201cfailure to follow a prescribed treatment \nplan related to a diagnosed psychological/psychiatric condition that may impair \njudgment, stability, reliability, or trustworthiness.\u201d SOR \u00b6 1.d is concluded for Applicant. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e \nSOR \u00b6 1.e alleges the DOD CAF psychologist\u2019s diagnosis of unspecified \npersonality disorder; the psychologist\u2019s opinion that Applicant\u2019s \u201cjudgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness are not appropriately intact, as evidenced by inconsistencies in the \nclinical interview, self-report measures, patient history, and review of records\u201d; and that \nApplicant \u201cdisplay[ed] a pattern of unreliable behavior, which would impair [his] \njudgment, reliability, and ability to properly safeguard classified national security \ninformation.\u201d \n  \nUnspecified Personality Disorder \nUnspecified personality disorder is a condition that may impair judgment, \nstability, reliability, or trustworthiness. AG \u00b6 28(b) is established by that diagnosis. \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \nJudgment, Reliability, and Trustworthiness \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nJudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness are not \u201cconditions\u201d within the meaning \nof AG \u00b6 28(b). \n \n \nInconsistencies in the Clinical Interview \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n\u201c[I]nconsistencies in the clinical interview, self-report measures\u201d apparently refers \nto Applicant being untruthful to the various doctors. However, in order for AG \u00b6 28(a) to \nbe applicable it must be \u201cbehavior . . . not covered under any other guideline.\u201d \n(emphasis added) That behavior could have been alleged under Guideline E (personal \nconduct). Therefore, it therefore cannot be used to establish AG \u00b6 28(a). \n \n \n \nPattern of Unreliable Behavior \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nA \u201cpattern of unreliable behavior\u201d under certain circumstances could be sufficient \nto establish AG \u00b6 28(a). The only problematic behavior I can identify as not covered \nunder another guideline is when Applicant placed a gun to his head, although that could \nalso arguably be covered as personal conduct under Guideline E. \nThe question then becomes was the behavior alleged. E3.1.3 of the Directive \nrequires that the SOR \u201cbe as detailed and comprehensive as the national security \npermits.\u201d If SOR \u00b6 1.e attempted to allege behavior under AG \u00b6 28(a), I do not know \nwhat specific behavior was alleged, and it is doubtful that Applicant knows. I am \nnonetheless treating it as though the SOR alleged that Applicant placed a gun to his \nhead. That behavior is sufficient to raise AG \u00b6 28(a) as a disqualifying condition. \nAG \u00b6 29 provides conditions that could mitigate psychological conditions security \nconcerns. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, and the \nindividual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with the \ntreatment plan;  \n(b) the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment \nprogram for a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is \ncurrently receiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a \nduly qualified mental health professional;  \n(c) recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional employed \nby, or acceptable to and approved by, the U.S. Government that an \nindividual\u2019s previous condition is under control or in remission, and has a \nlow probability of recurrence or exacerbation; \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n(d) the past psychological/psychiatric condition was temporary, the \nsituation has been resolved, and the individual no longer shows \nindications of emotional instability; and \n(e) there is no indication of a current problem. \nApplicant\u2019s military career is not perfect. He left with the same rank he achieved \nin 2008 when he was promoted below the zone. There were also highs. He was the \nhonor graduate of his boot camp. He was selected for promotion to E-4 in 2008 below \nthe zone. He did what was asked of him. He deployed to Iraq in 2009 and was \nrecognized with several medals and awards. Much of his mental health issues and \ndisciplinary problems coincided with his training and work as a remotely piloted aircraft \nsensor operator. His service resulted in PTSD and a 100% disability rating from the VA. \nHis service-connected PTSD is alleged as part of the basis for the denial of his security \nclearance. \nThere are several diagnoses in the record. I am satisfied that Applicant has \nsuffered from some form of mental health condition. The one I am most certain of is \nPTSD, which was never diagnosed by the DOD CAF psychologist, but was diagnosed \nby the doctors who treated him as an inpatient and for years in the VA. The DOD CAF \npsychologist diagnosed Applicant with unspecified personality disorder. Personality \ndisorders run the spectrum from the relatively benign (e.g., obsessive-compulsive \npersonality disorder, avoidant personality disorder) to significant (e.g., paranoid \npersonality disorder, antisocial personality disorder). It is unclear where Applicant falls in \nthat spectrum. \nI have no reason to disregard the DOD CAF psychologist\u2019s opinion, but I also \ngive weight to other doctor\u2019s opinions and the lay evidence of how Applicant is currently \ndoing. He is highly regarded at work and in his community. He has custody of his two \nchildren. Applicant\u2019s psychologist\u2019s conclusion makes the most sense to me: \nRegardless of the exact diagnoses in this case, it is apparent that \n[Applicant\u2019s] symptoms are largely under control with his current \nmedication regimen, even while working in the same field that led to his \ninitial psychiatric treatment. He is aware of his chronic mental health \nissues, and acknowledges that he will require ongoing medicinal \ntreatment. He indicated that he is open to returning to therapy, if needed. \nHe stated that he is asymptomatic at this time and has a good social \nsupport system. His home life is stable now that he is divorced and he has \ncustody of his children. He maintained that he will remain compliant with \nany and all treatment modalities, as needed. He does not feel he needs \ncounseling at this time.  \nI find that the identified conditions are readily controllable with treatment, and \nApplicant has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with his treatment plan. \nAG \u00b6 29(a) is applicable. Psychological conditions security concerns are mitigated. \n14 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline I in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s \nmilitary service and his favorable character evidence. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the psychological conditions security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline I: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

Applicant is a 63-year-old aircraft mechanic who has worked for a DOD contractor since March 2013. He has continuously worked for various DOD contractors since 1995. He currently earns $65,000 a year in this position. He received an airframe power plant license in 1994. He is married and has three adult children. His wife is currently employed as a medical technologist. Her annual salary is $80,000. (Tr. 20-22, 48; GE 1) Financial Considerations Applicant stated that he experienced financial problems over the years due to his wife\u2019s periods of unemployment, his personal health issues, and because his home was heavily damaged by fire in May 2021. His wife was unemployed from November 2009 to February 2011, December 2012 to May 2015, and from February 2021 to September 2022, for a total of 63 months. He said his wife had been laid off from these employments, but he did not give an explanation as to why she was unable to find employment for an extended period of time between jobs. In November 2020, Applicant had elective surgery, which soon required a second surgery after he developed a staph infection. He later acquired another serious infection, MRSA, which required even more antibiotics and seven weeks of intravenous fluids and a return to the hospital for surgery.

On December 16, \n2021, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA) Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (CAF) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant under \nExecutive Order (Exec.

On October 18, 2022, the \nDefense Office of hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Notice setting the hearing for \nOctober 27, 2022.

The hearing was held as scheduled using the DOD \nMicrosoft Teams video teleconference system. \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered 12 Government exhibits (GE), \nwhich I admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant\u2019s counsel did not offer any \nexhibits, but she requested that the record be held open so she could submit documents \non behalf of her client after the hearing. I granted her request, and held the record open \nuntil January 10, 2023. Applicant timely submitted six documents, which I labeled as \nApplicant exhibits (AE) A through F. I admitted all of the proffered exhibits into evidence \nwithout objection. On December 13, 2022, DOHA received a copy of the transcript (Tr.). \nThe record closed on January 11, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s SOR response, he admitted all of the allegations in SOR (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a, \nthrough 1.g). His admissions are accepted as findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 63-year-old aircraft mechanic who has worked for a DOD contractor \nsince March 2013. He has continuously worked for various DOD contractors since 1995. \nHe currently earns $65,000 a year in this position. He received an airframe power plant \nlicense in 1994. He is married and has three adult children. His wife is currently employed \nas a medical technologist. Her annual salary is $80,000. (Tr. 20-22, 48; GE 1) \nFinancial Considerations \nApplicant stated that he experienced financial problems over the years due to his \nwife\u2019s periods of unemployment, his personal health issues, and because his home was \nheavily damaged by fire in May 2021. His wife was unemployed from November 2009 to\nFebruary 2011, December 2012 to May 2015, and from February 2021 to September \n2022, for a total of 63 months. He said his wife had been laid off from these employments,\nbut he did not give an explanation as to why she was unable to find employment for an\nextended period of time between jobs. In November 2020, Applicant had elective surgery,\nwhich soon required a second surgery after he developed a staph infection. He later\nacquired another serious infection, MRSA, which required even more antibiotics and\nseven weeks of intravenous fluids and a return to the hospital for surgery. Then, on May \n27, 2021, his house caught on fire and the damages totaled over $300,000. He had\nhomeowner\u2019s insurance at the time of the fire.

He then filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in May 2010. The case was \ndischarged in August 2010. In August 2018, he filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy, but since \nhis tax returns were not yet filed, the bankruptcy case was dismissed. He refiled for \nChapter 13 bankruptcy in June 2019. This case was subsequently dismissed in \nSeptember 2022. (Tr. 29, 39; GE 6, GE 7, GE 8, GE 9, GE 10; AE C; SOR Response) \nApplicant stated that he filed for the first Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2001 because he \nand his wife fell behind on paying their credit cards, and a creditor had garnished his \nwages. His wife had been laid off from her part-time employment as a medical \ntechnologist. They decided to file for bankruptcy in 2001 to stop the garnishment. The \nsecond Chapter 7 bankruptcy was filed in May 2010, after his wife had been laid off from \nher full-time employment in November 2009. The Chapter 13 bankruptcy, initially filed in \n2018, and then refiled in 2019, was initially filed due to their delinquent home mortgage, \nand their home being placed into foreclosure. While the bankruptcy case proceeded, \nApplicant was able to obtain a mortgage loan modification and get the foreclosure action \ndismissed. Once that was arranged, he intentionally failed to make payments to the \ntrustee, and allowed the Chapter 13 bankruptcy case to be dismissed. (Tr. 28-35, 37-39, \n42, 45-47; AE B, AE E) \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant failed to timely file his Federal and state income \ntax returns for tax years 2012 through 2018. He failed to pay his Federal and state taxes \nfor those tax years, as required, and the taxes remain unpaid. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f, and 1.g.) In \nApplicant\u2019s response to the SOR, he stated that all of his tax returns were filed except for \ntax year 2019. He attributed the late filings due to complications from his wife\u2019s identity \ntheft. He did not give a sufficient explanation as to why he was unable to file his income \ntax returns separately during those years, or why his wife could not file her tax returns on \npaper rather than electronically, which is the method the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) \nadvises when an individual\u2019s identity is compromised. (Tr. 40-41, 45; SOR Response; GE \n1, GE 2) \nAt the hearing, Applicant stated that all unfiled state and Federal income tax \nreturns had been filed. He was uncertain of the total amount of state and Federal back \ntaxes owed. He had not yet arranged a payment plan with the IRS or with the state tax \noffice, but he hoped to start making tax payments soon. The IRS filed a proof of claim in \nAugust 2019 through the bankruptcy court. The claim for unpaid Federal taxes totaled \n$20,304 for tax years 2011, 2013 through 2018. No information was provided about the \ntotal amount of delinquent state taxes owed. These tax debts remain unresolved. (AE B, \nAE D; Tr. 39-45) \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant is indebted for delinquent student loans totaling \n$33,220 (SOR \u00b6 1.e). He stated that these loans are currently in deferment due to the \nCoronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, and that he is not obligated \nto make payments while they are deferred. He admitted that these student loans were \ndelinquent before the CARES Act deferment in March 2020. It is his intention to start \nrepaying these student loans when they come out of deferment.

In 2020, Applicant\u2019s filed \nseparately with reported income of $67,165, and in 2021, his income was reported as \n$48,878. I did not see separate income tax returns for his spouse for tax years 2020 or \n2021, but this may be due to her period of unemployment. Based on Applicant\u2019s \ntestimony, their joint income for tax year 2022 should be near the six-figure range again, \nwith his wife now employed. (GE 2; Tr. 48) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \n4 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR.

Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.    \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. \n5 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19 includes disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts;\u201d \u201c(c) a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations;\u201d and \u201c(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or \nlocal income tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired.\u201d \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant filed for bankruptcy protection on four separate \noccasions, and he has delinquent student loans currently in deferment. He failed to timely \nfile state and Federal income tax returns for seven consecutive years, and he has an \nunknown amount of delinquent state taxes, and at least $20,304 in delinquent Federal \ntaxes, which remain unresolved and unpaid. The record establishes the disqualifying \nconditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), and 19(f), requiring additional inquiry about the possible \napplicability of mitigating conditions. Discussion of the disqualifying conditions is \ncontained in the mitigation section. \nThe financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are as follows: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue, and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant bears the burdens of production and persuasion in mitigation.

The multiple filings for bankruptcy clearly show \nthat Applicant and his wife have a long history of not meeting their financial obligations. \nI find it troubling that Applicant failed to timely file his Federal and state income tax \nreturns for seven consecutive years. It appears that he filed his tax returns only after his \n2018 bankruptcy case was dismissed due to his unfiled returns. His justification that his \nwife\u2019s identity was stolen and caused them to file their state and Federal income tax \nreturns late, is certainly a circumstance beyond their control, but he must also show that \nhe acted responsibly under the circumstances to resolve these issues. There is little \ninformation in the record to show why he was unable to make better progress with the \nfiling of his state and Federal tax returns over the years. Allowing this problem to persist \nfor seven consecutive years does not support a finding that he acted responsibly under \nthe circumstances. Although he has now filed these state and Federal tax returns, this \naccomplishment does not mitigate his long period of inaction in this case. \nApplicant did not demonstrate that he acted responsibly under the circumstances \nto resolve his delinquent state and Federal taxes. There is no evidence of any debt-\nresolution efforts with the state or Federal government. These tax delinquencies have \npersisted for several years and are still unresolved. None of the financial considerations \nmitigation conditions apply. Applicant did not mitigate the financial considerations security \nconcerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines but some warrant additional comment. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. \u201c[A] favorable clearance decision means that the record \n7 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________________ \nI \ndiscloses no basis for doubt about an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.\u201d ISCR Case No. 18-02085 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 3, 2020) (citing ISCR Case \nNo.12-00270 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 17, 2014)). \nApplicant\u2019s untimely filing of his Federal and state income taxes continued for \nseven consecutive years. As such, he developed significant outstanding tax debts to both \nthe IRS and the state tax authority. He has not provided sufficient documentation that he \nhas arranged a payment plan or made any payments to the IRS or state tax authority. \nGiven his burden to demonstrate reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment, \nconclude Applicant did not meet that requirement. \nThis decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or \nwill not attain the state of reform necessary for award of a security clearance in the future. \nWith more effort towards establishing a track record of financial responsibility, and a better \nrecord of behavior consistent with his tax obligations, he may well be able to demonstrate \npersuasive evidence of his security clearance worthiness. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec.

(GE 2-5) \nIn an August 2021 interview with a background investigator, Applicant discussed \nthe origin of his financial problems and his decision to file for bankruptcy protection. He \nexplained that he began to experience financial problems after March 2017 when he \nwas laid off from his full-time security job at a casino. He experienced additional \nfinancial stress, because he was also providing financial support to his father.

Since separating from the Army Reserve in April 2017, he \nhas had only one source of income from his full-time employment. (GE 2-3) \nApplicant decided to file for bankruptcy protection in September 2019 because \nhis debt load was overwhelming, not because he was delinquent on any of his financial \nobligations. On the bankruptcy application, he reported monthly income of $4,248 and \nmonthly expenses of $3,930, leaving him with only $300 in disposable monthly income, \nand $89,153 in total liabilities. The court dismissed the bankruptcy in November 2019, \nbecause he failed to pay the required filing fee. He subsequently retained an attorney to \nassist him with the bankruptcy filing. In 2021, after Applicant completed the security \nclearance application, his attorney filed a motion to vacate the bankruptcy dismissal. \n(GE 1,3,5) \nWhen Applicant was asked during his August 2021 interview why he did not \ndisclose the 2019 bankruptcy on his March 2021 security clearance application, he \ndenied having any intent to withhold information from the Government.

He further explained that he was unaware \nthat any of his debts were delinquent or in collection status. Section 26: Delinquency \nInvolving Routine Accounts asks, \u201cIn the last seven (7) years have you had: any \nvoluntary repossessions; defaulted on any type of loan; had bills or debts turned over to \na collection agency; any account charged off; been over 120 days delinquent on any \ndebt on previously reported; or, currently 120 days delinquent on any debt? (GE 2-3) \nIn the background interview, Applicant admitted to having the vehicle financed by \nthe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c voluntarily repossessed and owing the alleged deficiency \nbalance of $10,622. The interview does not state when the voluntary repossession. The \ndebt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b ($12,945) is for a car loan, and the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.j \n($773) is for a credit card. Applicant told the investigator that he stopped paying both \ndebts because he could no longer afford them. The June 2021 credit report indicates \nthat all three accounts were charged off. (GE 3,5) \nIn Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, he included documentation showing that the \nChapter 7 bankruptcy petition was discharged in October 2021. The consumer accounts \nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, and 1.j were among the discharged debts. He also included \nin his bankruptcy petition $28,000 in student loans, alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d through 1.i. \nStudent loans are not typically discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy. In the August 2021 \ninterview, he stated that he placed the loans in a status that did not require payment. At \nthe time of the interview, he reported making $200 monthly payments towards the \nloans. The record does not contain any evidence to corroborate that claim. The June \n2021 credit report indicates that the loans are in collection status. (GE 1,3,5) \nApplicant\u2019s loans, which are all held by the U.S. Department of Education, are \ncurrently in administrative forbearance under the student loan payment pause initiated \nby President Biden in March 2020. The payment pause stopped collection activities on \ndefaulted student loans. For the duration of the pause, which is expected to last through \nAugust 2023, the loans are considered in good standing. Applicant did not articulate a \nplan \nfor \nresolving \nthe \nloans \nonce \nthe \npause \nis \nlifted. \n(See, \nhttps://studentaid.gov/announcements-events/covid-19#questions) \nApplicant attributes his financial problems to insufficient income, not extravagant \nspending, or financial irresponsibility. According to the financial information provided in \nthe subject interview, he earns sufficient income to cover his living expenses, including \nhis child support obligation. However, he only has $200 in disposable income each \nmonth.

According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire\nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-\nperson concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nUnresolved delinquent debt is a serious security concern because failure to \n\u201csatisfy debts [or] meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified \nor sensitive information.\u201d (AG \u00b6 18). Based on the information developed during the \ninvestigation, the SOR alleged that Applicant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection in \nSeptember 2019, and that the petition was dismissed in November 2019. The SOR also \nalleged that he owed $24,300 for three delinquent accounts, and six delinquent student \nloans totaling $25,308. He admits the September 2019 bankruptcy filing and denies the \nnine alleged delinquent debts without explanation. (GE 1) \nOn its own the dismissed bankruptcy petition is not disqualifying. Applicant \nattempted to file without counsel and his failure to pay a fee resulted in the petition\u2019s \ndismissal. There is no evidence that Applicant was attempting to abuse the bankruptcy \nprocess or act dishonestly. However, the delinquent debts reported in the SOR, which \nare proven by the June 2021 credit report (GE 5), the bankruptcy petition (GE 4), and \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s September 2021 background interview (GE 3) establish the Government\u2019s \nprima facie case. The following disqualifying conditions apply: \nAG \u00b6 19(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \nThe record contains sufficient evidence to establish that the financial concerns \nare partially mitigated. Applicant\u2019s financial problems do not appear to be caused by \nreckless spending or by financially irresponsible behavior, but a decrease in income \nsince 2017 that has made it difficult for him to maintain his financial obligations. \nApplicant\u2019s decision to file for bankruptcy protection was reasonable, and a legitimate \nmethod of resolving his debt given his circumstances. He acted responsibly by retaining \ncounsel to help him navigate the process, which resulted in the successful discharge of \nmost of his debt, including the accounts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b - 1.c, and 1.j. The \nfollowing mitigating condition partially applies: \nAG \u00b6 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problems were \nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances.  \nThe status of Applicant student loans prevents a finding of full mitigation. \nAlthough the loans are currently in good standing under the administrative forbearance \npause until at least August 2023, Applicant did not provide a plan to resolve the loans \nonce the pause is lifted. Based on the financial information in the record, it does not \nappear that he can afford to resume payment of the debt and that the loans will return to \ndelinquent status. While an applicant is not required to be debt-free to obtain a \nfavorable determination, he is required to provide a plan for how he intends to resolve \nthe remaining debts and establish that he has the means to do so. Absent that \ninformation, the financial considerations security concerns remain. \nPersonal Conduct \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. Of \nspecial interest is any failure to cooperate or provide truthful answers during national \nsecurity investigative or adjudicative process. (AG \u00b6 15) \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant intentionally falsified his March 2021 security \nclearance application by failing to disclose certain information under Section 26: \nFinancial Records. Specifically, the SOR alleged that he intentionally failed to disclose \nhis September 2019 bankruptcy petition, and he failed to disclose bills/debts turned over \nto collection agency or any suspended, cancelled, or charged-off credit cards in the \nseven years preceding the March 2021 security clearance application. Applicant \nadmitted the allegations without explanation.

Applicant stated that he was not aware that any of his accounts \nwere in collection or charged-off status. The record does not contain evidence to \ncontradict or cast doubt on that statement. The collections section of the June credit \nreport lists the nine accounts alleged in the SOR. While the notes of each debt may \nindicate the account status as charged off or in collection, it does not clearly state the \ndate at which the account entered the indicated status. The report gives an \u201cactivity \ndate,\u201d but does not explain what the date signifies, nor can the meaning be extrapolated \nfrom the context in which it is presented. As such I cannot find that Applicant \ndeliberately failed to disclose his collection and charged-off accounts. Accordingly, SOR \n\u00b6 2.b is resolved in his favor. \nHowever, the record contains sufficient circumstantial evidence that Applicant \nintended to withhold other derogatory financial information from the Government. He \nshould have disclosed the September 2019 bankruptcy filing. His explanation for failing \nto disclose the bankruptcy is not credible. The language of the question is clear and \nplain on its face. The question does not list any exceptions or qualifiers. Though not \nalleged, Applicant should have also disclosed the voluntary repossession resulting in \nthe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c. This question, in the \u201cdelinquency involving routine \naccounts\u201d section of the financial records questions, directly and clearly asks whether \nan applicant has had any property voluntarily repossessed in the last seven years. In \nhis background interview, Applicant disclosed a voluntarily car repossession, which \nresulted in a deficiency balance from which he sought relief in his September 2019 \nbankruptcy filing. \nIn failing to disclose either of these events, Applicant gave the impression to the \nGovernment that he did not have any financial problems at the time he completed the \nsecurity clearance application - an impression he knew was not true. He had been \nstruggling financially since at least 2017. His financial distress became acute to the \nextent he sought relief in bankruptcy protection two years before he completed a \nsecurity clearance application. Those problems were still present at the time he \ncompleted the application. His August 2021 interview with the background investigator \nled him to believe that his finances were an area of concern for the Government, \nprompting him to retain counsel shortly after that interview to vacate the dismissal of the \nSeptember 2019 petition. Accordingly, personal conduct disqualifying condition 16(a), \napplies: \nDeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine nation security eligibility \nor trustworthiness, or award fiduciary duties.  \nNone of the personal conduct mitigating conditions apply. An applicant is \nrequired to provide full, frank, and candid disclosure to the Government at all times \nregardless of the potential consequences.

In reaching this conclusion, I have also considered \nthe whole-person factors at AG \u00b6 2(d). Security clearance adjudications are not debt \ncollection proceedings. The AGs do not require an applicant to immediately resolve or \npay each and every debt alleged in the SOR, to be debt free, or to resolve first the debts \nalleged in the SOR. An applicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial \nproblems and take significant actions to implement the plan. Although Applicant made \nthe reasonable decision to seek relief from his debt through Chapter 7 bankruptcy \nprotection, he failed to take any action or articulate a plan regarding the rehabilitation or \nrepayment of his student loans after the payment pause is lifted in August 2023. His \nfailure to disclose derogatory financial information on his security clearance application \ncasts doubt on his reliability and trustworthiness, and his ability put the interest of the \nGovernment above his self-interest. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Financial Considerations: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.c, 1.j \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.d \u2013 1.i \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Personal Conduct: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.b \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nBased on the record, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nApplicant eligibility for a security clearance.

The February 2019 \ncharges remain outstanding and unresolved, as does a related active bench warrant for \nApplicant\u2019s arrest, which remains outstanding as of the close of the record. Applicant\u2019s \naccomplices in these offenses are Cuban nationals. Applicant was also terminated from \na job in 2016 after misusing a corporate credit card.

On May 18, 2023, DOHA issued a notice \nscheduling the hearing for June 14, 2023, with the hearing to occur via video-\nteleconference through an online platform. \nThe hearing convened as scheduled. Department Counsel submitted \nGovernment\u2019s Exhibits (GE) 1 through 21, along with three documents for administrative \nnotice (AN) purposes (AN I and AN II) and three Hearing Exhibits (HE I, HE II, and HE \nIII).

All exhibits were admitted without objection.

AE KK, LL, MM, and NN are admitted without objection. AE JJ is \na 2015 lease for the home where Applicant lived in Puerto Rico when she worked there. \nDepartment Counsel objected to AE JJ because it is in Spanish and not in English, and \nno translation was provided. (An addendum, regarding property remaining in the home \nwhen she left, is in English.) While this is correct, the objection is overruled, though I will \nconsider AE JJ for the limited purpose of documenting the fact that Applicant lived in \nPuerto Rico for a period of time, as also established by other record evidence. \nDOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on June 27, 2023.

The supporting documentation is marked as AN I. The relevant facts are \naddressed in the Findings of Fact, below. Department Counsel also requested that I \ntake administrative notice of an IRS document about the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico. \n(AN II) (Tr. 13-14) \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMotion to Amend the SOR \nAt the close of the evidence, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR by \nadding an allegation under Guideline F as follows: \n2.bb: You failed to file a federal income tax return for tax year 2015, as required. \nAs of June 14, 2023, the return had not been filed. \nThe motion was largely based on Applicant\u2019s testimony at hearing. (Tr. 92-93, \n117-118; GE 9 at 36, 39) Applicant did not object to the motion, but requested and \nreceived time after the hearing to submit mitigating information. (Tr. 124-129) \nFindings of Fact \nIn her Answer to the SOR, Applicant denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and admitted \u00b6 1.b \nunder Guideline J, with explanations. Under Guideline F, she partially admitted and \npartially denied the cross-allegation at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a, she admitted the conduct at SOR \u00b6 \n2.b, and she admitted all of the debts alleged, (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.c \u2013 2.aa), all with \nexplanations. Under Guideline B, she partially admitted and partially denied SOR \u00b6 3.a, \nand she denied SOR \u00b6 3.b, both with explanations. Applicant\u2019s admissions are \nincorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the \npleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is 40 years old. She married in 2013 and was divorced from her \nhusband in April 2021. She has a 23-year-old son from a previous relationship. She \nearned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2009 and a master\u2019s degree in 2013. (GE 1, GE 9 at 51; \nTr. 31-33, 48-49) \nApplicant has worked as a federal contractor since at least 2005. She worked for \none company from 2005-2008 and with another contractor from 2008 until 2014, both in \nState 1. In mid-2014, she moved to Puerto Rico with her family, for a job there with \nfederal contractor H. She held that job, in Puerto Rico, from mid-2014 until March 2016, \nwhen she was fired for misusing a corporate credit card, as discussed below. (GE 1 at \n20-22, 55-56, Tr. 32-33) \nAfter losing her job, Applicant returned to the mainland United States, moving to \nState 2. (Tr. 84-85) She was briefly unemployed, until May 2016. She then worked for \ncontractor C for several months, until she was hired by contractor R as a direct \nemployee in November 2016. She worked there for about a year, until moving to \ncontractor L in November 2017. She remains with contractor L, her current clearance \nsponsor, as a senior systems engineer. (GE 1 at 14-20; Tr. 31-33) She has held a \nclearance since at least 2008 or earlier. (Tr. 31, 69-70) \nIn March 2016, Applicant was terminated from company H for misusing a \ncorporate credit card. (SOR \u00b6 2.b) She explained in her background interview and in her \nAnswer that she used her corporate card at a local grocery store to buy food for a \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nbarbeque with other company employees. She said each employee\u2019s purchases were \nwithin the company\u2019s daily limit for credit card use. When she was questioned later, she \nsaid she used the card to buy herself food for a barbeque. She was accused of buying \nfood for others, which was against company policy. She was later terminated. (GE 9 at \n4; Answer;) Applicant said she never received a termination letter from company H. (GE \n9 at 52) \nGovernment Exhibit 8 is a February 8, 2022 e-mail from a security manager at \ncompany H to Department Counsel. It likely responds to an inquiry for additional \ninformation and company documents about the matter. The security manager\u2019s e-mail \nreferences information \u201cthat I was provided by our legal department.\u201d This information \nincludes \u201cadmissions\u201d from Applicant that she a) charged over $4,100 in personal \nexpenses on her company H corporate card; b) gave her corporate card to her husband \n\u201cto charge personal expenses in her absence;\u201d and c) \u201cmisled her manager regarding \nher physical location during work hours.\u201d (GE 8) However, there are no supporting \ndocuments provided in the record from the company to corroborate any of these \n\u201cadmissions.\u201d \nApplicant said she received an e-mail alert from the credit card company about \npossibly fraudulent charges. She then reported the matter to her employer. She said, \n\u201conce I found out it was my husband who did it, I paid it all off.\u201d (Tr. 45) She was still \nfired from her position, and she said it was because she used the company card for \nbuying people food, in preparation for a company barbeque, as she said in her Answer. \nShe said other company H employees were terminated for similar conduct. (Tr. 44-47) \nShe has not had similar allegations of credit card misuse with other employers. (Tr. 47) \nOn her SCA, Applicant disclosed that she had a roommate, Mr. H, a Cuban \ncitizen with U.S. residency. (GE 1 at 34-35) Mr. H\u2019s status as a Cuban citizen is alleged \nunder Guideline B. (SOR \u00b6 3.a). His associate, Mr. B, is also a Cuban national. (SOR. \u00b6 \n3.b) (Tr. 73-74) \nGuideline J: \nIn February 2019, Applicant was charged in State 3 with one count of felony theft \nand three counts of felony identity theft. (GE 2, GE 4) (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 2.a) The offenses \nallegedly occurred in September 2018. According to the criminal information filed by the \nprosecutor in a State 3 court, Applicant and two male accomplices: \nused the financial information of at least 15 people and used that financial \ninformation to move money from the victim\u2019s savings accounts into their \nchecking accounts and then withdraw from ATMs, make purchases. and \nobtain money orders over the course of 61 transactions removing a total of \n$40,419.78 in funds.\u201d (GE 2 at 4, Motion for Arrest/Detention (Probable \nCause))  \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant travelled to State 3 by plane in September 2018 and rented a car. \nUsing available information such as her driver\u2019s license and images from her social \nmedia accounts, local police identified Applicant on video at multiple area grocery stores \nmaking money orders using cards containing the names of the alleged victims, and on \nvideo at a local hotel. (GE 2 at 4; GE 3, police records) \nIt was noted that there was reasonable cause to believe that Applicant would not \nappear in response to a summons, so a warrant was issued for her arrest, on $50,000 \nbail. (GE 2 at 6; GE 19) A January 2022 fax to DOHA from a State 3 police department \nproviding the police records for the case included an \u201carrest date\u201d of April 2, 2019, but \nalso that there was a \u201cFelony warrant active/associated with this case.\u201d (GE 3 at 2) SOR \n\u00b6 1.a alleges both the outstanding arrest warrant and the underlying felony charges. (Tr. \n12-13) \nThe warrant first came to light through the DOD\u2019s Continuous Evaluation \nProgram, which noted the charges and the February 2019 warrant. The report also \nnoted that extradition was limited to five states in the Western United States. (GE 4; Tr. \n111-112) Applicant lives in State 2, in the Eastern time zone. She has not returned to \nState 3 since 2018. (Tr. 70) \nApplicant did not disclose the matter on her March 2020 SCA, and it was not \nraised or discussed during her December 2020 background interview. (GE 1, GE 9) She \ndenied SOR \u00b6 1.a in her Answer, asserting that she knew nothing about it until she \nlearned of it in about December 2021 or January 2022 after she received interrogatories \nfrom DOHA. (GE 9) She said she informed her facility security officer (FSO) a few days \nlater. She has pursued legal counsel in State 3 to resolve the matter. (Answer) \nHowever, she testified that she has taken no further action to resolve the matter, noting \nthat she was told that retaining local counsel in State 3 would cost between $25,000 \nand $60,000. The bond is also about $50,000. She has about $5,000 saved for this \npurpose. But the bench warrant remains outstanding. (Tr. 33-39, 70-72, 105-112; AE A) \nShe testified that she was told that she must retain counsel in State W because that is \nwhere the bench warrant was issued. She understands that an active bench warrant is \nan ongoing security concern. (Tr. 130-131) \nAs for the underlying criminal charges, Applicant testified that she went to State \nW with Mr. H in 2018, when she was considering moving there for a job. She said they \nwere at a restaurant and they \u201cran into\u201d an associate\u201d of his who asked her to buy \nmoney orders for him. They went to a store and Mr. B asked her to buy a money order. \nThey went to several stores to do so. Mr. B had a card with his name on it and he gave \nher the PIN number. S\n he \u201cnever expected it to be fraudulent.\u201d (Tr. 33-39, 72-76, 99-100, \n121) She also purchased a laptop and a book bag for Mr. B. She denied purchasing \nmoney orders for him 12 times. (Tr. 75) Applicant had never met Mr. B before but \u201cI \ntrusted Mr. H., so I assumed everything was good.\u201d (Tr. 100) She asserted that she \ncooperated with federal law enforcement officials when they asked her about the money \norders in State W. (Tr. 38-39, 107-108) The state elected not to file charges against Mr. \nH, who was also implicated by the police\u2019s evidence.

She \nsaid that \u201cthe same thing happened\u201d as in State 3: \u201cHe gave me some credit cards with \nhis name on it, [and] the PIN numbers, and asked me to do money orders.\u201d She said \nMr. B told her it was for his family in another state. She did not know they were fake. \n(Tr. 39, 76-77, 99-102, 121; Answer) \nAccording to police records. the conduct allegedly occurred on numerous \noccasions in October 2018. Police in State 4 had access to the records from the offense \nin State 3, and, from those records, it was \u201cimmediately apparent\u201d that Applicant and Mr. \nH were seen on multiple security videos in connection with the case in State 4. Felony \nwarrants for both Applicant and Mr. H were then obtained, in about November 2018. \n(GE 7 at 9; GE 6) \nApplicant first learned of the charges when \u201c[Mr. H] came back from Cuba and \nwas arrested, in 2019. She went to State 4 to get him out of jail and was herself \narrested. At the time Applicant and Mr. H were living together. She reported her arrest \nto her employer\u2019s FSO when she returned to work. (Tr. 39-40, 102-105) \nIn January 2019, Applicant was charged in State 4 on six felony counts, including \ncredit card fraud (over $500), receiving goods fraudulently (over $500), obtaining a \ncredit card number [for] larceny, and related conspiracy charges. She pled guilty to two \nmisdemeanor counts of credit card fraud (under $500). She received a 90-day \nsuspended jail term on each count and paid $9,000 in restitution. (SOR \u00b6 1.b) She \ncompleted the one-year probation term successfully. (Answer; AE B, AE C; Tr. 41-42, \n102-103 110-111). \nApplicant\u2019s petition to have the police and court records for the dismissed \ncharges expunged was granted in March 2022. (AE D, AE BB) She has not had any \nother arrests. (Tr. 42-43, 112) \nGuideline B: \nApplicant said Mr. H moved to the United States from Cuba in 2016. They \nbecame roommates in December 2017 and lived together until about October 2020. \nShe denied any romantic involvement. He now lives about 15 minutes away. They \nremain friends.

(GE 12-14, 15a, 15b, 15c, and 21) \nSome of Applicant\u2019s SOR debts have been paid. After the hearing, she provided \nan agreement with a credit counseling service that she retained in May 2023 to address \nher remaining debts. She is to pay $409 a month into the plan, according to the \nworksheet.

SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.c and 2.d are two credit card \naccounts Applicant opened with her former husband to build credit history. When the \nfamily moved to Puerto Rico in 2015, her husband refused to find a job, so Applicant \nwas responsible for everything for about three years, until 2018, and they fell behind on \ntheir payments. (Tr. 48-50) Since February 2022, she has been paying $100 a month \ntowards debts 2.c and 2.d.

(GE 9 at 5-6, 53; \nTr. 113-114) The state tax debt and tax lien in State 1 (SOR \u00b6 2.aa) ultimately resulted. \nApplicant testified that when she learned of the state tax lien, she contacted the \nstate comptroller\u2019s office. She said she was told to work through the IRS to resolve her \nfederal income and the state taxes would be revised accordingly. (Tr. 62, 114-116) She \nincluded several documents relating to her efforts to resolve her federal tax debts. This \nincludes her Form W-2 from contractor H for TY 2014 (AE N), correspondence with the \nIRS regarding TY 2014 (AE O), her 2014 and 2015 federal tax transcripts (AE P), and a \nletter from contractor H to the IRS (AE Y). \nApplicant believes that once her federal income for the years in question are \nclarified and corrected, she will not owe anything to past-due state income taxes to \nState 1. The state lien, however, remains outstanding, due to the discrepancy related to \nher income at company H. She said she remains in communication with State 1 but has \nnot paid anything of what she currently owes. (Tr. 61-62, 87-8) AE Y is an April 2022 \nletter from Company H to U.S. Social Security, in their attempts to clarify the matter. (AE \nY) Applicant acknowledged that she still owes about $8,000 in state taxes for TY 2014, \nand the lien remains in effect. (Tr. 114-115) \nApplicant acknowledged that she did not include her income earned from \ncompany H in Puerto Rico on her 2014 federal tax return because she believed she was \nentitled to a special tax status for Puerto Rico residents. (Tr. 87-92) Similarly, she did \nnot file a federal tax return for TY 2015 when she lived there and believes she did not \nhave to do so. (Tr. 92-93, 117-118) (SOR \u00b6 2.bb) She did file a federal tax return for TY \n2014, since she lived part of the year in State 1. (AE P) She does not believe she owes \nany past-due federal taxes. GE 17 is a 2016 IRS bill for $7,251 for TY 2014. Since \nreturning from Puerto Rico, she has lived in a state with no state income tax. (Tr. 93) \nAN II is an IRS publication (Pub. 1321) regarding \u201cSpecial Instructions for Bona \nFide Residents of Puerto Rico.\u201d It states, in part, that \nIn general, section 933 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code requires that \nU.S. citizens who are bona fide residents of Puerto Rico during the entire \ntaxable year, but who receive income from sources outside of Puerto Rico, \nand/or receive income as a civilian or military employee of the U.S. \nGovernment in Puerto Rico, must file a U.S. Federal income tax return. \nThe income you received from Puerto Rico sources is not subject to U.S. \nincome tax.

Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on \nmere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.

By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nApplicant has engaged in multiple criminal schemes to engage in credit card \nfraud and conspiracy, in two different states (where she has little to no other contact), \nalong with Mr. H, her roommate at the time, and his accomplice Mr. B, who purportedly \nappeared without notice seeking assistance in acquiring money orders. The schemes \nwere similar in nature, as Applicant acknowledged when she said \u201cthe same thing \nhappened\u201d in State 4 as it had in State 3, when Mr. B appeared and said he needed \nhelp. Applicant was arrested in State 4 for the charges at SOR \u00b6 2.b. The charges in \nState 3 (SOR \u00b6 2.a) remain outstanding and unresolved, as does the related bench \nwarrant. AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and 31(b) both apply. \nAG \u00b6 31(c) (individual is currently on parole or probation) does not technically \napply, though the outstanding bench warrant puts Applicant\u2019s liberty at risk on an \nongoing basis until it is resolved. \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 32 sets forth the potentially applicable mitigating conditions: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and  \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nApplicant receives some credit for complying with the requirements of probation \nfor the offense in State 3, but this credit is minimal, given the troubling pattern and \nsimilar nature of her conduct established by both offenses alleged. There is also the \nmatter of the bench warrant. Applicant has taken minimal efforts to resolve the bench \nwarrant since she learned of it from DOHA during the interrogatory process in early \n2022. She has approached local counsel in State 3 but retaining the attorney is cost \nprohibitive for her. (See Guideline F discussion, below). It matters little in this forum that \nshe may not face extradition from State 2 (in the eastern U.S.) to address a bench \nwarrant issued many states away in State 3 a western state. Applicant seeks a security \nclearance from the federal government. \u201cIt should be obvious, but it is nonetheless \nstated here that any applicant who has an outstanding bench warrant is not a good \ncandidate for a security clearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 14-00383 at 6, A.J. Leonard, Sept. \n23, 2014). (DOHA Hearing cases have no precedential value, but clearance applicants \nwith outstanding bench warrants who have not taken sufficient steps to resolve them \nare rare, and the same principle is applicable here). Applicant did not show that her \nconduct occurred under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on her reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. Applicant did \nnot mitigate security concerns about her established pattern of serious criminal conduct. \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nAG \u00b6 6 details the security concern about \u201cforeign contacts and interests\u201d as \nfollows: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if \nthey create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nAG \u00b6 7 indicates conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual's \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology; \nThe nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and \nits human-rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family \nmembers are vulnerable to government coercion or inducement. The risk of coercion, \npersuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian \ngovernment, a family member or friend is associated with or dependent upon the \ngovernment, the country is known to conduct intelligence collection operations against \nthe United States, or if the foreign country is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nA heightened security risk is established by the administratively noticed facts \nabout Cuba in the record, due to human rights issues and Cuba\u2019s relationship with the \nUnited States. (AN I) AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) are established. Mr. H and Mr. B are both \nunderstood to be Cuban citizens. Mr. H remains in the United States as a permanent \nU.S. resident. Mr. B\u2019s whereabouts are unknown, but he is an associate of Mr. H, and \nboth are accomplices in the schemes to commit credit card fraud in both State 3 and \nState 4, with Applicant\u2019s assistance. At best, Applicant was unquestionably induced, \npressured, or coerced to go along with their plans. At worst, she was a wholly willing \nparticipant. Even if only the former is established, that satisfies AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b). \nAG \u00b6 8 lists conditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns, \nincluding: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.; \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and  \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual or \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation.  \nApplicant remains in contact with Mr. H, her former roommate. They remain \nfriends who speak frequently. Mr. B is established as Mr. H\u2019s accomplice, and as \nsomeone for whom Applicant has a track record of assisting in the commission of \nserious crimes (along with Mr. B). The foreign influence concern with these two foreign \n(non-U.S. citizen) individuals is less about their connections to Cuba, per se; rather, it is \ntheir established influence over Applicant and her willingness to engage in serious \ncriminal conduct (and at best, repeated instances of extremely poor judgment) at their \nbehest. No foreign influence mitigating conditions apply. \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is \ndetailed in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd.

The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;  \n(d) deceptive or illegal financial practices such as embezzlement, \nemployee theft, check fraud, expense account fraud, mortgage fraud, filing \ndeceptive loan statements and other intentional financial breaches of trust; \nand  \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nThe delinquent debts established in the SOR are established by the credit \nreports in the record and by Applicant\u2019s admissions. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply. \nApplicant\u2019s two sets of criminal charges (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b) are cross-alleged \nas a financial security concern under SOR \u00b6 2.a. Applicant was also terminated from \ncompany H in 2016 after she misused a company credit card. (SOR \u00b6 2.b) Both SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n2.a and 2.b constitute intentional financial breaches of trust, and AG \u00b6 19(d) applies to \nboth.  \nAs to her criminal conduct (SOR \u00b6 2.a), \u201c[a]n individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise questionable \nacts to generate funds,\u201d quoted from the general financial concern of Guideline F (AG \u00b6 \n15), also applies. \nApplicant had a responsibility to file a 2015 federal income tax return, absent a \nshowing that her unique circumstances meant she did not have to do so. Even though \nshe lived in Puerto Rico for all of 2015, she did not establish that she did not have a \nduty to file a 2015 federal income tax return (even if Puerto Rico income was exempt \nfrom federal taxes). SOR \u00b6 2.bb is established, and AG \u00b6 19(f) applies. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n15 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant\u2019s various debts arose because she became financially overextended. \nIn no small part, this was because (or was made worse by) the money she had to pay in \nrestitution for the offense at SOR \u00b6 1.b, in State 3. The total financial implications of \nSOR \u00b6 1.a, her ongoing offense with the outstanding bench warrant, are unknown. \nApplicant has paid or is paying many of the debts alleged in the SOR, so some credit is \ndue under AG \u00b6 20(d). However, she began paying many of the debts after receiving \nthe SOR in early 2022. (HE III) This lessens the mitigating effect of her efforts. Her \nstudent loans are in good standing according to credit reports in the record, but she has \nnot established a reasonable payment plan to address them. AG \u00b6 20(d) does not fully \napply to mitigate her debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. It does not apply to the cross-alleged criminal \noffenses for the same reason that they are not mitigated under Guideline J above. The \nsame is true for her 2016 termination, which followed misuse of a corporate credit card. \nShe did not show that her conduct occurred under such unusual circumstances, that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on her reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment. It also does not apply to her debts, or to her unresolved tax debt and unfiled \ntax return, which are ongoing. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) has some application, since Applicant has retained a credit \ncounseling service to address her remaining debts, but she has yet to put the payment \nplan into effect. But she has not shown that her debts are being resolved and are under \ncontrol. \nApplicant did not provide enough evidence to establish that her tax debts and \nunfiled tax returns are being resolved. She has contacted appropriate tax authorities \nand is seeking belated assistance to address the matter but has no arrangements in \nplace to do so. AG \u00b6 20(g) does not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \n16 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines J, F, and B in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant has engaged in a pattern of troubling criminal conduct with her former \nroommate Mr. H and his associate Mr. B. They have been involved in a scheme to steal \nother people\u2019s money through credit card fraud. The nature of their conduct would \ncause a reasonable person to pause before rendering assistance. Applicant did not do \nthat. She willingly assisted in the scheme. A bench warrant for the State 3 felony \ncharges remains outstanding. Further, many applicants are denied access to classified \ninformation because they have incurred delinquent debts \u2013 thereby putting themselves \nin position where they may commit illegal financial acts. Applicant has already \ncommitted illegal acts and has done so on several occasions. That conduct, along with \nthe debts and of course the bench warrant, all mean she does not qualify for eligibility \nfor a security clearance. \nApplicant has not met her burden to establish that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant her continued eligibility for access to classified information. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with significant unresolved questions and \ndoubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \n17 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nParagraph 2, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.c-2.d:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.e:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.f: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.g-2.t: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.u-2.z:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.aa-2.bb: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3: Guideline B: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 3.a-3.b:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant access to classified information. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nBraden M.

(Tr. at 44-46; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE \n10) \nApplicant was drinking wine by himself in his apartment in February 2019. He \ndrank at least one bottle of wine. He cut his finger on a broken wine bottle, and he \naccidentally caused a crease in an extension faucet. The water leaked from the faucet, \nwith the overflow going into the apartment below him. His neighbor called maintenance \nabout the leak. When maintenance arrived at his apartment, they noticed the blood and \nthe water, and they contacted the police. The police also received calls, apparently from \nhis friend, indicating that Applicant had threatened to end his own life, had suicidal \nthoughts (ideation), and had threatened to kill his friend. When police arrived, they \nfound multiple empty wine bottles, and Applicant was described as belligerent and \nintoxicated. (Tr. at 20, 46-50; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2, 10) \nA detention warrant was issued, and Applicant was taken to the hospital in the \nevening of February 15, 2019. His lacerated finger was treated, and his blood was \ncollected at 11:30 p.m. His BAC was .376%. He received a psychological screening the \nnext morning. A differential diagnosis considered was suicidal ideation (SI), homicidal \nideation (HI), co-ingestion, and acute alcohol intoxication. The provisional diagnosis was \nalcohol abuse. He was assessed with alcohol-induced mood disorder and alcohol use \ndisorder, mild, abuse. An alcohol use disorder diagnosis requires the presence of at \nleast 2 of the 11 criteria listed in the DSM-5. Applicant was deemed to be positive for 3 \nof the criteria. The DSM-5 indicates that if 2 to 3 of the criteria are met, the disorder is \nspecified as mild. (Tr. at 67-68; GE 2; HE III) \nThe doctor discussed alcohol use disorder with Applicant.

He \nwas at a baby shower with his girlfriend (now wife) that lasted for about eight to nine \nhours. He drank, but he did not believe he was intoxicated. He stated that he was \ndriving with his girlfriend, and they had an argument. He was using his cell phone for \nnavigation, when it fell. He swerved and hit the curb. They parked in a parking lot, got \nout of the truck, and continued to argue. The police arrived and arrested him. A blood \ntest measured .18% and .14% BAC.

(Attachments to Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; AE 2-10) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nThe security concern for alcohol consumption is set out in AG \u00b6 21: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 22. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder; and \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder. \nApplicant was arrested for DWI in December 2015 and June 2021. He was \narrested or cited for public intoxication in July 2018, November 2018, and October 2019. \nHe was hospitalized for alcohol intoxication and suicidal ideation in February 2019. AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 22(a) and 22(c) are applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate alcohol consumption security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 23. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations; and \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with \ntreatment recommendations. \nApplicant had been sober for 718 days as of the date of the hearing. He saw his \ncompany\u2019s counselor several times. He has attended AA meetings two to three times a \nweek for the last year. His marriage is happy, and his wife does not drink. He is more \nhealth conscious, with a better diet and daily exercise. He does not believe that he is an \nalcoholic; but he is convinced that his life is better without alcohol. \nApplicant is commended for his efforts to remain sober. Nonetheless, I have \nlingering concerns about his drinking and the extremely poor judgment he exhibited \nwhile drinking. His most recent DWI is still pending trial. AG \u00b6 2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny \ndoubt concerning personnel being considered for national security eligibility will be \nresolved in favor of the national security.\u201d None of the mitigating conditions are \nsufficiently applicable to overcome concerns about Applicant\u2019s alcohol use, reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and judgment. \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern for criminal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about an Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following is potentially applicable: \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nThe SOR cross-alleges Applicant\u2019s alcohol-related arrests under criminal \nconduct. AG \u00b6 31(b) is applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate criminal conduct security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 32. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the \noffense; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nApplicant is still pending trial for his most recent arrest. The analysis under \nalcohol consumption applies equally here. His criminal conduct continues to cast doubt \non his current reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and willingness to comply with \nlaws, rules, and regulations. The above mitigating conditions, individually or collectively, \nare insufficient to alleviate those concerns. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \nclearance investigative or adjudicative processes. The following will \nnormally result in an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, \nsecurity clearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national \nsecurity eligibility: \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or cooperate \nwith security processing, including but not limited to meeting with a \nsecurity investigator for subject interview, completing security forms or \nreleases, cooperation with medical or psychological evaluation, or \npolygraph examination, if authorized and required; and \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful questions of \ninvestigators, security officials, or other official representatives in \nconnection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, \ninvestigator, security official, competent medical or mental health \nprofessional involved in making a recommendation relevant to a national \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsecurity \neligibility \ndetermination, \nor \nother \nofficial \ngovernment \nrepresentative. \nThe CAF requested that Applicant undergo a psychological evaluation in March \n2021. The evaluation was voluntary, but he was advised that \u201crefusal to participate in an \nindependent psychological evaluation will result in the denial of [his] security clearance \napplication due to [his] failure to cooperate.\u201d He reported to the evaluation in August \n2021, but he refused to talk about the June 2021 DWI. AG \u00b6\u00b6 15(a) and 16(b) are \nestablished. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a \nperson with professional responsibilities for advising or instructing the \nindividual specifically concerning security processes. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability. \nApplicant relied on the generic advice of his criminal defense attorney to not \ndiscuss the case. He did not request specific advice from his attorney about the \nevaluation. He realizes now that it was a mistake to not fully participate in the \npsychological evaluation. He remains willing to undergo another evaluation. He \nparticipated in a private psychological evaluation by a clinical psychologist in May 2023. \nIt is difficult to undo Applicant\u2019s failure to participate in the CAF evaluation, \nbecause he left the CAF and me without vital information in the determination of his \nsecurity worthiness.

Personal conduct security concerns are not \nmitigated. \nGuideline I: Psychological Conditions \nThe security concern for psychological conditions is set out in AG \u00b6 27: \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair \njudgment, reliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is \nnot required for there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified \nmental health professional (e.g., clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) \nemployed by, or acceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, \nshould be consulted when evaluating potentially disqualifying and \nmitigating information under this guideline and an opinion, including \nprognosis, should be sought. No negative inference concerning the \nstandards in this guideline may be raised solely on the basis of mental \nhealth counseling. \nAG \u00b6 28 provides conditions that could raise psychological conditions security \nconcerns.

Upon his discharge, it was recommended that \nhe seek substance abuse treatment and mental health counseling. However, as of the \ndate of his 2021 psychological evaluation, he had not complied with those \nrecommendations. \nAG \u00b6 28(a) \nApplicant was extremely drunk before he was hospitalized in 2019. That behavior \ncasts doubt on his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. However, that behavior is \ncovered under the alcohol consumption guideline, and by definition cannot be \u201cbehavior \nthat casts doubt on an individual\u2019s judgment, stability, reliability, or trustworthiness, not \ncovered under any other guideline\u201d (emphasis added). As such, that conduct cannot \nbe used to establish AG \u00b6 28(a) as a disqualifying condition. Suicidal ideation is \nthoughts or \u201cideas\u201d of suicide. Thoughts are not behavior. AG \u00b6 28(a) is not applicable. \nAG \u00b6 28(b) \nAG \u00b6 28(b) requires 1) an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional \nthat the individual has a condition; and 2) that the condition may impair judgment, \nstability, reliability, or trustworthiness. \nSOR \u00b6 3.b alleges that Applicant was hospitalized for acute alcohol intoxication. \nAlcohol intoxication is a medical condition under the DSM-5. Without going too far into \nthe medical terminology, in lay person\u2019s terms, alcohol intoxication means that Applicant \nwas drunk, and acute alcohol intoxication means that he was extremely drunk. It is a \ncondition may impair judgment, stability, reliability, or trustworthiness. AG \u00b6 28(b) is \napplicable. \nAG \u00b6 28(c) \nAG \u00b6 28(c) requires not just hospitalization, but inpatient hospitalization. Inpatient \nis not defined in the adjudicative guidelines, but Merriam-Webster defines it as \u201ca \nhospital patient who receives lodging and food as well as treatment.\u201d Applicant was in \nthe hospital from the evening of February 15, 2018, until about 11:09 a.m. on February \n16, 2019. The medical record indicates that he did not meet the criteria for inpatient \nhospitalization. I believe he was treated overnight and released the next morning, but he \nwas never admitted as an inpatient. AG \u00b6 28(c) is not applicable. \nAG \u00b6 28(d) \nAG \u00b6 28(d) requires a \u201cprescribed treatment plan,\u201d not just an encouragement for \nApplicant to track his alcohol use and to seek counseling or outpatient support.

The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, and the \nindividual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with the \ntreatment plan; \n(b) the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment \nprogram for a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is \ncurrently receiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a \nduly qualified mental health professional; \n(c) recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional employed \nby, or acceptable to and approved by, the U.S. Government that an \nindividual\u2019s previous condition is under control or in remission, and has a \nlow probability of recurrence or exacerbation; \n(d) the past psychological/psychiatric condition was temporary, the \nsituation has been resolved, and the individual no longer shows \nindications of emotional instability; and \n(e) there is no indication of a current problem. \nWhat we are left with under Guideline I is that in February 2019, Applicant was \ntreated for acute alcohol intoxication, or in other words, he was extremely drunk. It does \nnot require a psychologist to make that determination, and that conduct is appropriately \naddressed under the alcohol consumption guideline. Any psychological considerations \nsecurity concerns generated by that conduct are mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines E, G, I, and J in my whole-person analysis.

I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the security concerns under Guideline I, but he did not mitigate the security \nconcerns under Guidelines E, G, and J. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline G: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.g: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline I: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 3.a-3.b: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 4, Guideline E: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 4.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance.

(Tr. at 17-19, 37, 43-44; GE 1, 2) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, including unpaid taxes and \ndelinquent debts. It was initially difficult for him to pay his debts, but he could pay the \ndebts at some point, he just chose not to. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(b), 19(c), and 19(f) are \napplicable. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems resulted primarily from the loss of income in about \n2015. That was a condition that was beyond his control. However, he now has the \nability to address his debts. He just chooses not to address them because the debts are \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n\u201cwater under the bridge,\u201d and he is \u201cjust moving forward.\u201d He is waiting for the debts to \nfall off his credit report because they are beyond the seven-year reporting period. The \nfact that a debt no longer appears on a credit report does not establish any meaningful, \nindependent evidence as to the disposition of the debt. See, e.g., ADP Case No. 14-\n02206 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 15, 2015) and ISCR Case No. 14-03612 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. \n25, 2015).  \nApplicant\u2019s tax issues have been ongoing for more than a decade and remain \nunresolved. Failure to comply with tax laws suggests that an applicant has a problem \nwith abiding by well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary compliance \nwith rules and systems is essential for protecting classified information. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 16-01726 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 28, 2018). A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill \nhis or her legal obligations, such as paying taxes when due, does not demonstrate the \nhigh degree of good judgment and reliability required of those granted access to \nclassified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01382 at 4 (App. Bd. May 16, \n2018). \nThere is insufficient evidence for a determination that Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems will be resolved within a reasonable period. I am unable to find that he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances or that he made a good-faith effort to pay his taxes \nand debts. His financial issues are recent and ongoing. They continue to cast doubt on \nhis current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. None of the mitigating \nconditions are applicable. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \nclearance investigative or adjudicative processes. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a trustworthiness concern and may \nbe disqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nSOR \u00b6 2.a alleges that Applicant falsified an SF 86 in 2012. There is no evidence \nthat Applicant ever submitted an SF 86 in 2012. AG \u00b6 16(a) is not applicable. SOR \u00b6 2.a \nis concluded for Applicant. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s \nhonorable military service. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant refuted \nthe personal conduct security concerns, but he did not mitigate the financial \nconsiderations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.s: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.t: \nWithdrawn \nSubparagraph 1.u: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \nFor Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

(Tr. 21-41, 43-44, 88-92; GE 1, 2) \nIn the SOR, the Government alleged Applicant\u2019s eight delinquent debts totaling \napproximately $60,500 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.h). These delinquencies consist of the \nfollowing: a credit card (SOR \u00b6 1.a); a personal loan (SOR \u00b6 1.b); car loans (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c \nand 1.d); and tuition for college courses (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e through 1.h). He admitted the \nSOR allegations with additional comments. The SOR allegations are established by his \nadmissions and the Government\u2019s credit reports. (Answer; GE 3-5) \nThe debts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.d, are owed to the same creditor. \nApplicant opened these accounts in 2014 and 2015 and became delinquent on them in \nabout December 2015. He called the creditor to try to make a payment arrangement in \n2020, early 2021, and May 2021, but he claimed the creditor asked him to work with the \ncollection agency to which the debts had been assigned. The collection agency for \nthese debts has not contacted him and he has not been able to obtain its contact \ninformation. His last payment on these accounts was in November 2015 and the last \ntime he attempted to contact either the creditor or the collection agency was in May \n2021. He has not resolved these debts. (Tr. 45-53, 55-63, 65-66; Answer; GE 1-5) \nThe debts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e through 1.h for college tuition are owed to the \ncollege he attended. He incurred these debts from August 2016 until May 2017. The \ncollege notified him that he was delinquent on these debts in the winter of 2017. During \nthe winter of 2017, he went to the college to try to resolve the issue. He told a \nrepresentative of the college that he thought the GI Bill should have covered his tuition. \nHe left the college that day thinking that the GI Bill would pay his outstanding tuition and \nhe believed the matter was resolved. (Tr. 66-72; Answer; GE 1-3) \nHe did not follow up again with the college until 2020 when he received a \ncollection letter from a collection agency regarding his outstanding tuition. He called the \ncollection agency and made a payment arrangement with them. He also went back to \nthe college and explained again that he thought the GI Bill should cover the tuition. He \nleft the college once again believing that the matter was resolved, and the GI Bill would \npay the tuition. Based upon this understanding, he did not make any payments pursuant \nto the payment arrangement he made with the collection agency.

He provided no documents showing that the GI Bill should or did pay his \ntuition, which is especially important given the nature of his discharge from the Army. \nThese debts appear on the October 2020 credit report, but they do not appear on the \nDecember 2021 or the May 2023 credit reports. (Tr. 66-72; Answer; GE 1-3) \nApplicant\u2019s financial issues were caused by inadequate income to cover his living \nexpenses, especially from 2014 until 2018 while he lived in Country A (where he \nclaimed cost of living expenses were inordinately high) and worked for a government \ncontractor there. He claimed his tuition delinquencies were also caused by a \nmisunderstanding involving the availability of GI Bill benefits. (Tr. 19-21, 47-49, 66-72; \nAnswer; GE 1, 2) \nApplicant claimed that after he moved back to the United States in late 2018, his \nfinancial situation has improved dramatically, especially after he began working for his \ncurrent employer in November 2019. Beginning in November 2019, he earned between \n$103,000 and $105,000, annually. At the time of the hearing, he earned $111,000, \nannually. He receives about $1,300 per month in disability benefits from Veterans \nAffairs (VA). He plans to apply for more, as he is not currently being compensated for \ninjuries he suffered while in the Army National Guard. He claims that he can pay his \nfinancial obligations and that he has a surplus of about $2,300 at the end of each \nmonth. He has a savings account with about $200 in it, but claimed it normally has a \nbalance between $500 and a couple of thousand dollars. He claimed the balance is \nlower right now because he had to pay unforeseen veterinary expenses. He has a \nretirement account through his current employer with a balance of about $26,000. He \nalso has a retirement account with one of his employers in Country A, but he does not \nknow the balance. He provided a written budget that he claims he follows. He also \nclaimed that he owns a wrecked car located in Country A that needs a new motor that \nhe can potentially sell to help pay his SOR debts. (Tr. 32, 37-40, 75-76, 84-86, 110-115; \nAnswer; AE A) \nIn 2019, Applicant attended two online financial counseling courses. For one of \nthese courses, he watched a video and read a book on how to become debt free. In \nJanuary 2023, he financed the purchase of a new sport utility vehicle (SUV) for $71,000. \nHe traded in a vehicle he purchased in 2020 and used the value of that vehicle as a \ndown payment for the SUV. He pays approximately $1,150 per month on this vehicle. In \nMarch 2023, he financed the purchase of a used compact car for $17,000. He traded in \nanother vehicle that he purchased in 2020 and used the value of that vehicle towards \nthe down payment of the compact car. He pays approximately $330 per month on this \nvehicle.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant had eight delinquent debts totaling approximately $60,500. He became \ndelinquent on these debts between 2015 and 2017. This evidence show that he has a \nhistory of being unable to pay his debts and not meeting his financial obligations. The \nabove listed conditions are applicable, thereby shifting the burden to Applicant to \nprovide evidence in mitigation. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n. \nApplicant has not provided sufficient evidence that he has resolved any of the \nSOR debts. He does not claim to have resolved the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.d. \nHe assumed the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e through 1.h have been resolved because he \nbelieved the GI Bill should have paid for them and they no longer appear on his credit \nreport. While the tuition debts no longer appear on his credit report, there are many \nreasons other than favorable resolution that a debt does not appear on a credit report. \nThe burden falls on Applicant to show that his established debts have been resolved. \nHe has not provided sufficient evidence that he has done so. Since 2020, he has not \ncontacted the creditor or the collection agency to determine the status of the tuition \ndebts. He has not provided documents to show that the GI Bill should or did satisfy \nthese debts. His financial issues are ongoing, and I cannot find they are unlikely to \nrecur. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. This lack of evidence of resolution also means that \nAG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply.  \nApplicant\u2019s financial issues were caused by underemployment and not \nunderstanding whether GI benefits would apply. Underemployment is arguably beyond \nhis control. For AG \u00b6 20(b) to fully apply, he must also show that he acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances. He has not. While he attempted to resolve the debts initially, \nhe has not contacted the creditor or collection agency since May 2021 for the debts in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.d., and since 2020 for the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e through 1.h. \nInstead of resolving his existing delinquencies, he has incurred significant, additional \ndebt by financing the purchase of new cars, including an expensive SUV. AG \u00b6 20(b) \ndoes not fully apply. \nWhile Applicant has received some financial counseling, his unresolved debts \nshow that his financial problem is not resolved and is not under control. His financing of \nthe aforementioned SUV after taking courses on becoming debt free further shows that \nthe counseling did not help resolve his financial problems. AG \u00b6 20(c) does not fully \napply. \nApplicant has not provided documentary evidence that GI Bill benefits should \nhave covered his tuition. His failure to inquire as to the status of these tuition debts \nsince 2020 means he has not taken sufficient action to resolve any dispute he might \nhave. AG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply. As none of the mitigating conditions are fully \napplicable, the Guideline F security concerns continue to raise questions and doubts \nabout his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I have also considered \nApplicant\u2019s military service. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.h: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on November 19, 2019. On \nDecember 22, 2021, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security \nconcerns under Guideline F. The CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated in Security Executive Agent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines (December 10, 2016). \nApplicant answered the SOR on May 24, 2022, and requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on July 11, 2022, and \nthe case was assigned to an administrative judge on November 1, 2022. It was \n1 \n\n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nreassigned to me on December 15, 2022, due to the medical inability of the assigned \nadministrative judge to travel to the hearing site. On January 4, 2023, the Defense Office \nof Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was scheduled for \nJanuary 19, 2023. I convened the hearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 \nthrough 5 were admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified but did not \npresent the testimony of any other witnesses or submit documentary evidence. I kept the \nrecord open until February 10, 2023, to enable him to submit documentary evidence. He \ntimely submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through C, which were admitted without \nobjection. His cover email for the three exhibits listed confirmation numbers for the debts \nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.l through 1.o, but no documentation. Because of the testimonial \nnature of the email, I have marked it as AX D. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on \nJanuary 27, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c, \n1.f-1.l, and 1.p-1.r. He denied the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.e, and 1.m-1.o.

He served on active duty in the U.S. Navy from May 2010 \nto April 2013 and received a medical discharge as a result of service-connected injuries. \nHe held a security clearance in the Navy but does not currently have a clearance. \nApplicant attended college from July 2013 to May 2015 and received an \nassociate\u2019s degree in culinary arts in May 2015. He married in March 2011 and has three \nchildren, ages 13, 11, and 9 (Tr. 17.) \nThe SOR alleges three unsatisfied judgments, 17 delinquent debts, and failures to \nfile federal and state income tax returns for 2016, 2017, and 2018. The unsatisfied \njudgments alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c are reflected in court records (GX 3.) The \ndelinquent debts are reflected in credit reports from March 2021 and January 2020 (GX \n4 and 5). The evidence concerning the debts alleged in the SOR is summarized below. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c: judgments for $16,634; $5,379; and $1,780. During a \npersonal subject interview (PSI) with a security investigator in January 2020, Applicant \ntold the investigator that the three judgments entered against him in 2019 and 2020 were \ncaused by the failure of his tenants in a rental property to pay the rent, which made him \nunable to make the payments on the mortgage loan. He told the investigator that he had \nmodified the loan and that all payments were current. (GX 2 at 4.) \nAt the hearing Applicant testified that the judgment for $16,634 (SOR \u00b6 1.a) was \nfor the amount due on an auto loan after the auto was stolen and totaled, and the \ninsurance was insufficient to pay off the loan. (27.) He testified that he established a \npayment plan \u201ca few months ago\u201d providing for payments of about $200 per month. He \n2 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ntestified that he has been making the payments when he can. He did not submit any \ndocumentation of payments or a payment plan. \nAt the hearing, Applicant testified that the judgment for $5,379 (SOR \u00b6 1.b) was \ndue to the loss of an auto that was destroyed in a flood. He testified that he intended to \nresolve it, but he provided no documentation of any steps to carry out his intent. \nApplicant testified that the judgment for $1,780 was for unpaid rent for the family \nresidence, and that it had been resolved. (Tr. 32-33.) The court records reflect that it was \nfor \u201cunlawful detainer,\u201d which is consistent with Applicant\u2019s testimony. (GX 3 at 3.) After \nthe hearing, he submitted a resident ledger showing his payment history from June 2019 \nto December 2020. (AX B.) The ledger does not reflect the judgment or any steps to \nresolve it, but it does reflect late charges and legal fees assessed in September 2019, \nJanuary 2020, February 2020, September 2020, October 2020, November 2020, and \nDecember 2020. Applicant submitted no evidence that the judgment has been satisfied. \nSOR \u00b6 1.d: delinquent child-support payments totaling $8,300. During the PSI, \nApplicant stated that he had an agreement to pay $286 to resolve the arrearage. (GX 2 \nat 4.) In his answer to the SOR, he stated that he had reduced the arrearage to less than \n$3,000. At the hearing, he testified that he had reduced it to about $1,400. (Tr. 35, 65.) \nHe no longer pays child support because his son is living with him. (Tr. 65.) After the \nhearing, he submitted his payment history as of February 6, 2023. It reflects that he was \npaying $286 monthly, that the last payment was in May 2022, and that the arrearage is \n$2,221.62. (AX C.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.e: delinquent debt charged off for $45,752. Applicant testified that this \ndebt is a duplicate of SOR \u00b6 1.a. (Tr. 37.) The debt was charged off in February 2016, \nand the judgment alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a was entered in 2019 by the same credit union. \nThe credit reports do not reflect any other auto loans with this creditor. \nSOR \u00b6 1.f: delinquent debt charged off for $15,752. In the PSI, Applicant \nadmitted this debt. He stated that it was a joint auto loan account with his wife and that \nhe forgot to make a payment. He stated that he had a payment plan providing for monthly \npayments of $525 and that the payments were current. (GX 2 at 7-8.) He provided no \ndocumentary evidence of payments or a payment plan. At the hearing, he admitted that \nthat this debt was a deficiency after a repossession and that it was not resolved. (Tr. 40.) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g, 1.h, and 1.k: delinquent debts charged off for $9,133; $8,347; and \n$1,365. The same credit union is the creditor for all three debts. Applicant testified that \nhe was not sure if they were credit-card accounts or personal loans. He has taken no \naction to resolve them. (Tr. 41-42.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.i: delinquent credit-card account placed for collection of $3,832. This \ndebt was a delinquent credit-card account associated with a military exchange store. \nApplicant testified that it is being satisfied by garnishment of $300 per month. (Tr. 42-43, \n56.) After the hearing, he submitted a \u201cConfirmation of Authorization for Recurring \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTransfers from Account\u201d from a collection agency, dated February 6, 2023. The document \nreflects Applicant\u2019s credit-card account number and reflects an agreement to pay $300 \nper month beginning on February 28, 2023. It does not reflect that any payments have \nbeen made. \nSOR \u00b6 1.j: delinquent debt placed for collection of $1,365. During the PSI, \nApplicant stated that he had no knowledge of this debt. (GX 2 at 6.) At the hearing, he \ntestified that it was for a television set or a computer, and that he had taken no action to \nresolve it. (Tr. 44.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.l: delinquent debt charged off for $1,236. Applicant testified that this \ndebt was for furniture, and that he had taken no action to resolve it, but that he intended \nto resolve it. (Tr. 45.) In his post-hearing submission, he provided a confirmation number \nbut no documentation of any action. \nSOR \u00b6 1.m: telecommunications debt past due for $726. Applicant testified that \nthis debt was for unreturned equipment, and that he had paid it two years ago. (Tr. 46.) \nIn his post-hearing submission, he provided a confirmation number but no documentation \nto support his testimony. \nSOR \u00b6 1.n: utility bill past due for $352. Applicant testified that this debt arose \nwhen he moved to another residence, and that he paid it in 2020. (Tr. 48.) In his post-\nhearing submission, he provided a confirmation number but no documentation to support \nhis testimony. \nSOR \u00b6 1.o: insurance debt past due for $283. Applicant testified that this debt \narose when he switched insurance companies, and that he paid it in 2021. (Tr. 48-49.) in \nhis post-hearing submission, he provided a confirmation number but no documentation \nto support his testimony. \nSOR \u00b6 1.p: delinquent debt charged off for $1,364. In the PSI, Applicant told \nthe investigator that this debt was for the purchase of a television set. (GX 2 at 5.) At the \nhearing, he testified that he could not identify the debt. (Tr. 49.) The debt is not resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.q: delinquent auto loan charged off for $7,055. In the PSI, Applicant \ntold the investigator that he had no knowledge of this debt. (GX 2 at 7.) At the hearing, he \ntestified that he learned two years ago that the debt was delinquent but that he had taken \nno action to resolve it. (Tr. 51.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.r: failure to file federal and state income tax returns for 2016, 2017, \nand 2018. During the PSI, Applicant told the investigator that he and his wife had filed \njoint returns prior to 2016, and he forgot to file his returns for 2016, 2017, and 2018. In \nthe January 2020 PSI, he told the investigator that he had delivered his tax information to \na professional tax preparer who would prepare the returns. (GX 2 at 8.) At the hearing, \nhe submitted no evidence that he had filed his returns. He attributed his failure to file his \nincome tax returns to \u201cbad information\u201d he received, leading him to believe that he was \n4 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \nnot required to file tax returns if he did not earn a certain amount of money, and that he \nwas unemployed or in school during those three years. (Tr. 18.) His testimony is \ncontradicted by the employment information he provided in his SCA, which reflects that \nhe was employed full time during 2016, 2017, and 2018. (GX 1 at 14-16.) \nApplicant\u2019s net income is about $2,400 per month. He receives disability pay of \nabout $1,600 per month. He had about $9,000 in his retirement account when he last \nchecked it a year ago. His wife is not employed outside the home, but she is a disabled \nmilitary veteran and receives about $4,000 per month in disability pay. They have three \nautomobiles, model years 2012, 2017, and 2022. Their total car payments are about \n$1,100 per month, and car insurance is about $380 per month. They pay $93 per month \nfor cable and internet, and $600 for utilities. He estimates that he and his wife have a net \nmonthly remainder of about $600 after paying their bills. (Tr. 56-65.) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n5 \n\n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nAt the hearing, Applicant asserted that the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e is included \nin the judgment alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e was charged off in February \n2016 and the judgments alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b were obtained in 2019 by the \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsame creditor. The credit reports do not reflect that Applicant had any other auto loans \nwith this creditor. I conclude that the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e probably is duplicative. \nWhen the same conduct is alleged twice in the SOR under the same guideline, the \nduplicative allegations should be resolved in Applicant\u2019s favor. See ISCR Case No. 03\u00ad\n04704 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2005) (same debt alleged twice). Accordingly, I have \nresolved the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence submitted at the hearing establish the \nfollowing disqualifying conditions under this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \nAG \u00b6 19(f): failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax as required. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to\nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy\nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides\ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n \n \n \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s financial delinquencies are recent, \nnumerous, and were not incurred under circumstances making recurrence unlikely. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not fully established. Applicant\u2019s injury and medical discharge, the \nfailure of his tenants to timely pay their rent, the theft of an automobile, and the destruction \nof an automobile by flooding were conditions largely beyond his control. However, he \nprovided no evidence of responsible efforts to resolve the judgments against him. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is not established. Applicant submitted no evidence of financial \ncounseling, and his financial problems are not under control. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is not established. Applicant submitted no evidence that he is \u201cadhering \nto a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d He provided \nsome evidence of payments on the child-support arrearage, but his evidence reflects that \nhis last payment was in May 2022. \nApplicant testified that the debt to the military exchange service was being \ncollected by garnishment, and after the hearing he submitted evidence of a payment plan \nfor the debt to the military exchange service, but it did not reflect that any of the agreed \npayments had been made. Payment by involuntary garnishment is not a good-faith \ninitiation of repayment by the debtor. ISCR Case No. 09-05700 (App. Bd. Feb. 24, 2011). \nHis payment arrangement initiated after the hearing does not reflect a timely good-faith \neffort. Evidence of past irresponsibility is not mitigated by payment of debts only under \npressure of qualifying for a security clearance. Applicants who begin to address their \nsecurity-significant conduct only when their personal interests are at stake may be lacking \nin judgment and reliability. ISCR Case No. 16-01211 (App. Bd. May 30, 2018). \nApplicant submitted confirmation numbers for the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.l \nthrough 1.o. Submission of confirmation numbers does not establish anything more than \na source of possible information. It would be inappropriate for an administrative judge to \ncontact a creditor to determine what information was confirmed. The Directive makes it \nclear that it is the responsibility of the parties to present evidence for the administrative \njudge\u2019s consideration. ISCR Case No. 08-10170 (App. Bd. Jul. 8, 2011). The Directive \ndoes not authorize an administrative judge to act as an investigator for either party in a \nsecurity clearance proceeding. ISCR Case No. 15-01515 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 17, 2016.) \nAG \u00b6 20(e) is not established. Applicant has not disputed any of the debts alleged \nin the SOR. \nAG \u00b6 20(f) is not established. Applicant submitted no evidence that any of the past-\ndue tax returns have been filed. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). I have considered that Applicant served \nhonorably in the U.S. Navy until he was medically discharged, and that his spouse also \nis a disabled military veteran. Applicant\u2019s testimony at the hearing reflected that he does \nnot have a clear understanding of the extent of his financial problems or a credible plan \nto resolve them. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under \nGuideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by his delinquent debts and \nfailures to timely file his federal and state income tax returns. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.f-1.r: \nAgainst Applicant \n9 \n\nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information. Clearance \nis denied. \nLeRoy F. Foreman \nAdministrative Judge \n10 \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with comments, nearly all the SOR allegations pertaining to criminal conduct (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a., 1.b., and 1.d.). He did not specifically address the allegation for the same conduct cross-referenced as sexual behavior (SOR \u00b6 2.a.). Background Applicant is a 51-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving initially as an operation engineer and subsequently as lead operation engineer since he was employed in February 2019. He was previously employed by other employers as a journeyman electrician (September 2014 until February 2019, and October 2007 until January 2013), and part time in building maintenance (May 2013 until February 2014). He received a Bachelor of Science in electrical engineering in 2018. He has never served with the U.S. military.

Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn March 27, 2019, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted a \nQuestionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86). On May 11, 2022, the Defense \nCounterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA) Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive); and \nDirective 4 of the Security Executive Agent (SEAD 4), National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines (December 10, 2016) (AG), effective June 8, 2017. \nThe SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) and \nGuideline D (Sexual Behavior) and detailed reasons why the DCSA adjudicators were \nunable to find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a \n1 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsecurity clearance for Applicant.

A complete copy of the Government\u2019s \nfile of relevant material (FORM) was mailed to Applicant by the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) on September 12, 2022, and he was afforded an \nopportunity after receipt of the FORM to file objections and submit material in refutation, \nextenuation, or mitigation. In addition to the FORM, Applicant was furnished a copy of the \nDirective as well as the Adjudicative Guidelines applicable to his case. Applicant received \nthe FORM on September 15, 2022. His response was due on October 15, 2022. Applicant \nchose not to respond to the FORM, for as of October 31, 2022, no response had been \nreceived. The case was assigned to me on December 2, 2022. The record closed on \nOctober 31, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with comments, nearly all the SOR \nallegations pertaining to criminal conduct (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a., 1.b., and 1.d.). He did not \nspecifically address the allegation for the same conduct cross-referenced as sexual \nbehavior (SOR \u00b6 2.a.). \nBackground \nApplicant is a 51-year-old employee of a defense contractor.

He has never served \nwith the U.S. military. He was granted an interim security clearance in 2019, and it was \nrevoked with the issuance of the SOR in 2022. He was married in 1994 and divorced in \n2006. He has three children, born in 1991, 1993, and 1998. \nCriminal Conduct and Sexual Behavior \nOn April 5, 2002, Applicant was arrested and charged with battery against a \nhousehold member. That household member was his wife at that time. Applicant \ncontended that his wife came before the judge and requested that the charge be dropped, \nand that he did not spend any time in jail. (Answer to the SOR at 2) She confirmed that \nshe went before the judge, and stated that from her knowledge, Applicant was never \nconvicted of the charge.

He was released from \npre-trial confinement on July 10, 2017, and arraigned on August 21, 2017. (Item 5; Item \n6) \nAlthough the bond recommended by the state was $50,000, bond for the first eight \ncharges was set at $15,000.

On January 8, 2020, those charges were conditionally discharged. The \nremaining charges were dismissed as part of the plea agreement. Applicant was \nsentenced and placed on probation for a period of one and one-half years. Among \nstandard and special conditions of his probation, he was prohibited from consuming or \npossessing alcoholic beverages; prohibited from possessing any weapons; required to \nmaintain full time employment; required to submit to random urinalysis; required to \nperform 80 hours of community service; required to pay $35 per month probation costs; \nand prohibited from having direct or indirect contact with the minor victim or her mother. \n(Item 7; Item 4) There is no evidence to indicate that Applicant was required to register \nas a sex offender. \nThe remaining charge associated with Applicant\u2019s criminal sexual contact of a \nminor in the fourth degree with BD (child between 13 and 18) to touch or apply force to \nthe intimate parts, to wit: vulva, when she was less than eighteen years of age, between \nNovember 1, 2011, and February 29, 2014, was resolved on February 28, 2020, by the \nsame judge who presided over the other charges. Applicant had also entered a plea of \nno contest to this charge as well. On February 28, 2020, the charge was conditionally \ndischarged. Applicant was sentenced and placed on probation for a period of one and \none-half years, to be served concurrently with the other probation. Identical probation \nrequirements and prohibitions were set forth.

Applicant submitted an opinion from the state court of appeals to support his \ncharacterization of a conditional discharge. (Answer to the SOR at 4; Statement from \nApplicant\u2019s attorney at 1, attached to Answer to the SOR) \nCharacter References \nSeveral coworkers in senior management positions have known Applicant since \nhe joined his employer in February 2019. They all agree that he is a valuable team \nmember and model employee who has a very strong work ethic, is efficient, diligent, and \nextremely competent, as well as very honest, dependable, reliable, and trustworthy. One \nindividual noted that during his period of probation, Applicant was unable to support \ncertain missions because he was unable to leave the state and not able to bring electronic \ndevices, such as his anklet, into the workspace. (Character references attached to \nAnswer to the SOR at 30-34) \nTwo of Applicant\u2019s children, including a son who is a member of the U.S. Marine \nCorps, are even more supportive of him. They describe him as very loving and caring. \nCharacter references attached to Answer to the SOR at 35-36) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The President has \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.) \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \n5 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  \n(ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1)) \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994)) \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2005)) \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 \n7) Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this \ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not \nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing a clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nAnalysis \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in AG \n\u00b6 30: Criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to \ncomply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n6 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline notes two conditions under AG \u00b6 31 that could raise security \nconcerns: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted.  \nAG \u00b6 31(b) has been established. AG \u00b6 31(a) has not been established because \nwhile there is one minor misdemeanor reflected in the record, there is no pattern of minor \noffenses. On June 30, 2017, Applicant was arrested and charged in two separate cases \nwith a variety of criminal sexual offences with two minors, his then-cohabitant\u2019s minor \ndaughters. On December 12, 2019, as part of a plea agreement, Applicant entered a plea \nof no contest to the offenses of contributing to the delinquency of a minor (child under 13) \nto lesser fourth degree felonies associated with only the first three of the grand jury \ncharges. On January 8, 2020, those charges were conditionally discharged. The \nremaining charges were dismissed as part of the plea agreement. Applicant was \nsentenced and placed on probation for a period of one and one-half years. The remaining \ncharge associated with Applicant\u2019s criminal sexual contact of a minor in the fourth degree \n(child between 13 and 18) was resolved on February 28, 2020, by the same judge who \npresided over the other charges. Applicant had also entered a plea of no contest to this \ncharge as well. On February 28, 2020, the charge was conditionally discharged. Applicant \nwas sentenced and placed on probation for a period of one and one-half years, to be \nserved concurrently with the other probation. There is no evidence to indicate that \nApplicant was required to register as a sex offender. \nAs noted above, Applicant denied the underlying conduct of the charges to which \nhe entered pleas of no contest, and argues that a conditional discharge is not a felony \nconviction. His attorney claimed that once a defendant successfully completes his \nprobation, his case is over, and there is no conviction. The Government countered that \ndespite his insistence of innocence, Applicant is collaterally estopped from denying that \nhe engaged in the behavior underlying his felony \u201cconvictions,\u201d even on an Alford plea, \nciting ISCR Case No. 02-03248 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 27, 2005). Nolo Contendere means \u201cI \nwill not contest it.\u201d It is a plea to a criminal charge that has a similar effect to pleading \nguilty except that, because the individual has not admitted guilt, the plea cannot be used \nagainst that individual in any other subsequent litigation. Department Counsel noted that \nunder the laws of the state where the \u201cconvictions\u201d took place, a defendant may not be \ncriminally sentenced unless there is a legal conviction of a crime, and that a conviction \nmay follow a plea of no contest, citing the statute in question. (Item 8) This is not a unique \ninterpretation of the law, for probation is a sentence, after a criminal conviction, that \nreleases a person into the community under the supervision of a probation officer. \nAdditionally, the Government noted that the fact that the criminal charge may have been \ndismissed following the period of deferred sentencing does not preclude a judge from \n7 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndetermining that Applicant engaged in the underlying misconduct, citing ISCR Case No. \n08-08606 at 1 (App. Bd. Dec. 4, 2009). In this instance, there is substantial evidence of \ncriminal conduct, and Applicant\u2019s argument that he was not convicted of a felony is \nimmaterial. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions under AG \u00b6 32 that could \nmitigate security concerns arising from Criminal Conduct: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nNeither condition applies. The incidents for which Applicant entered a plea of no \ncontest were alleged to have occurred most recently in December 2012; February 2014; \nand May 2016 \u2013 all after years of such conduct involving two minor victims. The charges \nwere conditionally discharged in January 2020 and in February 2020, and probation was \nto be served concurrently for a period of one and one-half years following the most recent \ncourt action. In other words, Applicant\u2019s probation essentially was completed in mid-2021. \nSince the legal process commenced, there is no evidence that Applicant ever underwent \ncounseling, therapy, treatment, or assessments to address the conduct leading to those \ncharges. \nWhile there are positive factors present, such as no recurrence of criminal activity \nsince the alleged last incident and an excellent work record, there is also another \nsignificant negative factor: Applicant\u2019s failure to take any responsibility for his criminal \nmisconduct. As noted by Department Counsel, this failure perpetuates doubts about his \njudgment, trustworthiness, and reliability, and his current willingness to comply with laws, \nrules, and regulations, citing ISCR Case No. 17-01680 at 4 (App. Bd. Jul. 19, 2019) (When \nan applicant is unwilling or unable to accept responsibility for his or her own actions, such \na failure is evidence that detracts from a finding of reform and rehabilitation.); ISCR Case \nNo. 04-04264 at 3 n.2 (App. Bd. Sep. 8, 2006) (It is a well-established principle that the \nfirst step on the road to rehabilitation is to fully admit one\u2019s misconduct.) Because of the \nseriousness and length of time of the sexual criminal conduct in which Applicant \nparticipated, the mere simple passage of time warrants a lengthier period without \nrecurrence. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01680 at 4 (App. Bd. Jul. 19, 2019); ISCR Case \nNo. 08-03726 at 3 (App. Bd.

Sexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a \nlack of judgment or discretion; or may subject the individual to undue \ninfluence of coercion, exploitation, or duress. These issues, together or \nindividually, may raise questions about an individual's judgment, reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information. \nSexual behavior includes conduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, \nelectronic, or written transmission. No adverse inference concerning the \nstandards in this Guideline may be raised solely on the basis of the sexual \norientation of the individual. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 13: \n(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has \nbeen prosecuted; \n(b) a pattern of compulsive, self-destructive, or high-risk sexual behavior \nthat the individual is unable to stop;  \n(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and \n(d) sexual behavior of a public nature or that reflects lack of discretion or \njudgment. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 13(a), 13(b), 13(c) and 13(d) have been established. My discussion related \nto Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct is adopted herein. On June 30, 2017, Applicant was \narrested and charged in two separate cases with a variety of criminal sexual offences \u2013 \nthe specifics which need not be repeated here \u2013 with two minors, his then-cohabitant\u2019s \nminor daughters. On December 12, 2019, as part of a plea agreement, Applicant entered \na plea of no contest to the offenses of contributing to the delinquency of a minor (child \nunder 13) to lesser fourth degree felonies associated with only the first three of the grand \njury charges. On January 8, 2020, those charges were conditionally discharged. The \nremaining charges were dismissed as part of the plea agreement. Applicant was \nsentenced and placed on probation for a period of one and one-half years. The remaining \ncharge associated with Applicant\u2019s criminal sexual contact of a minor in the fourth degree \n(child between 13 and 18) was resolved on February 28, 2020, by the same judge who \npresided over the other charges. Applicant had also entered a plea of no contest to this \ncharge as well. On February 28, 2020, the charge was conditionally discharged. Applicant \nwas sentenced and placed on probation for a period of one and one-half years, to be \nserved concurrently with the other probation. There is no evidence to indicate that \nApplicant was required to register as a sex offender. The repeated pattern of his sexual \n9 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nbehavior over a lengthy period was seemingly self-destructive (to his co-habitant \nrelationship and his career), and high-risk since some of it was of a criminal nature. It \nreflected a lack of discretion and judgment. It is unclear if the behavior was compulsive \nbecause Appellant was able to eventually stop continuing it, but there was no treatment \nor counseling to assess the actual psychological nature of the behavior. He was \nvulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or duress during the period that he kept the behavior \nunreported between himself and the two minor victims. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from sexual behavior under AG \u00b6 14: \n(a) the behavior occurred prior to or during adolescence and there is no \nevidence of subsequent conduct of a similar nature; \n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under \nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment; \n(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; \n(d) the sexual behavior is strictly private, consensual, and discreet; and \n \n(e) the individual has successfully completed an appropriate program of \ntreatment, or is currently enrolled in one, has demonstrated ongoing and \nconsistent compliance with the treatment plan, and/or has received a \nfavorable prognosis from a qualified mental health professional indicating \nthe behavior is readily controllable with treatment. \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply. The behavior occurred while Appellant \nwas a mature individual residing with a co-habitant man with her two minor children at \nhome. Appellant failed to even consider entering a treatment or counseling program to \npossibly put to rest the potential issue as to whether he had a sexual dysfunction, or if the \nbehavior is likely to recur. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \n10 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, \n392 (2d Cir. 1966); see also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006). \nThere is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct and \nsexual behavior. Applicant is a 51-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has \nbeen serving initially as an operation engineer and subsequently as lead operation \nengineer since he was employed in February 2019. He was previously employed by other \nemployers as a journeyman electrician and part time in building maintenance. He \nreceived a Bachelor of Science in electrical engineering in 2018. He was granted an \ninterim security clearance in 2019, and it was revoked with the issuance of the SOR in \n2022. He was married in 1994 and divorced in 2006. He has three children, born in 1991, \n1993, and 1998. His coworkers are highly supportive of him. He gets some credit for \ninitially identifying his alleged criminal conduct and sexual behavior. \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is simply more \nsubstantial and compelling. On June 30, 2017, Applicant was arrested and charged in \ntwo separate cases with a variety of criminal sexual offences with two minors, his then-\ncohabitant\u2019s minor daughters. On December 12, 2019, as part of a plea agreement, \nApplicant entered a plea of no contest to the offenses of contributing to the delinquency \nof a minor (child under 13) to lesser fourth degree felonies associated with only the first \nthree of the grand jury charges. On January 8, 2020, those charges were conditionally \ndischarged. The remaining charges were dismissed as part of the plea agreement. \nApplicant was sentenced and placed on probation for a period of one and one-half years. \nThe remaining charge associated with Applicant\u2019s criminal sexual contact of a minor in \nthe fourth degree (child between 13 and 18) was resolved on February 28, 2020, by the \nsame judge who presided over the other charges. Applicant had also entered a plea of \nno contest to the charge to this charge as well. On February 28, 2020, the charge was \nconditionally discharged. Applicant was sentenced and placed on probation for a period \nof one and one-half years, to be served concurrently with the other probation. Applicant\u2019s \nfailure to take any responsibility for his criminal misconduct perpetuates doubts about his \njudgment, trustworthiness, and reliability, and his current willingness to comply with laws, \nrules, and regulations. Accordingly, I conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from his criminal conduct and sexual behavior. See SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 \n2(d) (1) through AG 2(d) (9). \n11 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                        \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.c.:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d.:  \n \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline D:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a.:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.

Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of Exec. Or. 10865 \nprovides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no \nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also Exec. \nOr. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive \ninformation). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . .. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax \nreturns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required. \nApplicant has a history of not being able to pay her debts. She also failed to timely \npay her state income taxes for TY 2010. The evidence is sufficient to raise AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \n19(c), and 19(f). \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nCircumstances beyond Applicant\u2019s control, including her spouse\u2019s period of \nunemployment followed by his sudden death, contributed to her financial problems. Given \nthe record as a whole, I find that she acted responsibly under her circumstances. After \nher spouse\u2019s passing in 2017, she attempted to pay her financial obligations on her own. \nWhen she could no longer do so, she retained the services of a debt resolution company \nin June 2018. She entered a debt consolidation plan that she paid into until September \n2019, when she decided to pay her debts on her own because the company was taking \ntoo long to pay them on her behalf. She sold her home in October 2018 and downsized. \nBefore the SOR, she began paying SOR \u00b6 1.d; she paid SOR \u00b6 1.e in April 2020; and she \npaid SOR \u00b6 1.d in July 2022. \nApplicant was in contact with the creditors to resolve SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, 1.f, and \n1.g in April 2020. She made a payment toward SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b; and she entered \npayment arrangements for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.f. She intends to pay these remaining debts \nas she has the financial means to do so, tackling the smaller ones first. As of the 2022 \ncredit reports, SOR \u00b6 1.f was reported in a favorable status, reflecting that  Applicant was \npaying this account as agreed. In January 2023, she entered a payment arrangement to \nresolve her outstanding state taxes in SOR \u00b6 1.g, and she made five payments of $125 \nin accordance with that arrangement as of March 2023. She received financial \ncounseling. With her recent pay increase, she has the means to continue resolving her \nremaining debts. She has responsibly addressed her debts within her means in light of \ncircumstances that were beyond her control. She is not required to be debt free. She has \ndemonstrated a meaningful track record of payments towards her debts sufficient for me \nto conclude that she will follow through on her plan to repay them. I find that her financial \nissues do not continue to cast doubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, and \njudgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), 20(d), and 20(g) are established. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-\nperson analysis. Overall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as \nto Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude that Applicant \nhas mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.g: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nCandace Le\u2019i Garcia \nAdministrative Judge \n8 \n",

The hearing was held as scheduled. The \nGovernment offered exhibits (GE) 1 through 6. Applicant testified and did not offer any \ndocumentary evidence. There were no objections to the Government\u2019s exhibits, and they \nwere admitted in evidence. The record remained opened until July 26, 2023, to permit \nApplicant an opportunity to provide additional evidence. He provided documents that were \nmarked Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through G. There were no objections to the exhibits. \nThey were admitted in evidence and the record closed. DOHA received the hearing \ntranscript on July 17, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted all of the allegations. His admissions are adopted as findings \nof fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits \nsubmitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 48 years old. He has three previous marriages and married a fourth \ntime in 2013. He has a grown child from a previous marriage. He has a stepchild and a \nbiological child, who is 12 years old, from his current marriage. He earned a bachelor\u2019s \ndegree in 2019. Applicant enlisted in the military in 1995 and retired honorably in the \npaygrade E-8 in 2017. While serving in the special forces, he completed multiple combat \ntours in Afghanistan and Iraq. He is a 100% disabled veteran. Applicant has been \nemployed since 2017 by a federal contractor, with his income increasing incrementally \nsince then. His wife is also employed by a federal contractor. (Tr. 20-32; AE A) \nShortly before Applicant retired, his now 12-year-old son was diagnosed with \nautism. At the time, Applicant was transitioning from the military, and his son was having \ndifficulty in school. It was determined that the school he was attending was not beneficial \nfor the special needs and therapy his son required. His son was doing poorly in his classes \nand stopped being verbal or going outside at recess. Applicant and his wife decided to \nmove to a school district that had the necessary resources to help their son thrive. They \nfound the right school district that had the structure he needed. Each level of school, \nelementary, middle, and high school were all located within a mile of each other which \nwas helpful for access to the therapy he needed. The therapists that were part of the new \nschool district were more readily available to address the special needs of Applicant\u2019s \nson. Since attending the school, his son has thrived and is achieving A/Bs on his report \ncards and has earned several belts in karate. (Tr. 32-35, 76-80, 82) \nA farmhouse became available in the school district that Applicant wanted his son \nto attend. He and his wife chose to purchase the farm to ensure their son could go to the \nright school. Their purchase also allowed them to have animals, which has been \ntherapeutic for their son. This farm was located in a place where members of the \ncommunity have deep roots and purchasing a farm is not an opportunity that arises often. \nThey did not want to miss the opportunity, so they purchased the farm. Because they \npurchased the farm before they could sell their house, Applicant experience financial \ndifficulties.

It took approximately two years and $20,000 \nto $30,000 to make marketable. During this period, Applicant had two mortgages and was \nusing credit cards to pay his expenses. He overextended his finances. He was able to \nfinally sell the home in 2019. They broke even on the sale. Applicant admitted he was \noverextended with his finances. (Tr. 32-35, 38) \nDuring this period, Applicant stepdaughter was attending college. Her mother paid \nmost of her tuition, room and board, and expenses, but he would also contribute to her \neducational expenses. He also helped her financially when she moved to a new state for \na job. (Tr. 35-36, 73-75) \nIn approximately 2018-2019, Applicant\u2019s father was diagnosed with cancer. He \nwas able to complete the chemotherapy treatments but, in the summer of 2022, he had \nissues with his diabetes. He went into the hospital for what was to be routine surgery but \nexperienced a fall and went into a coma. He did not recover and had to be removed from \nlife support. During this time, Applicant visited his father, who lived in another state and \nhelped his mother. He anticipates at some point in the future, his mother will need to move \nin with either him or his sister. He expects it to be him because he has children, and she \nwill want to be closer to them. It is a difficult time for his mother, and he tries to help her \nmanage her affairs. (Tr. 36-38, 60) \nApplicant admitted that he should have acted sooner in resolving his delinquent \ndebts. He understands the importance of being fiscally responsible. He was put on notice \nin April 2021 when he completed his background investigation that his finances were a \nsecurity concern and again when he received the SOR in December 2021. Applicant \nbegan resolving his delinquent debts after he received the SOR. (Tr. 95-96; Answer to \nthe SOR; AE A) \nThe SOR alleges eight delinquent debts totaling approximately $43,973. Applicant \nprovided evidence with his March 2023 answer to the SOR that he settled the credit card \ndebt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c ($6,541) in July 2022. In August 2022, he paid in full the debt \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d ($6,495). He provided supporting documentation that he paid in full \nthe debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e ($6,148), 1.f ($3,869), 1.g ($1,719), and 1.h ($206). Applicant \nalso provided proof of payment for $8,816 for a debt that was not alleged in the SOR. (Tr. \n40-47, 53-54, 91-92; Answer to the SOR; GE 3, 6; AE F) \nApplicant testified that the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a ($12,148) and 1.b ($6,847) are \nowed to the same creditor and he recently contacted it to resolve them. He credibly \ntestified that he was paying his other debts and was tackling the smaller ones first. He \nwas hesitant to negotiate a settlement for the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a because he believed if \nhe settled the debt for less than the amount alleged it would be viewed negatively. Post-\nhearing, he provided proof that he reached a settlement agreement for both debts and \npaid the settlement amounts.

He still \nmaintained about $11,000 in his checking account. (Tr. 50, 56, 58-59, 87-89) \nApplicant readily admitted and took full responsibility for his financial shortcomings \nand failure to act more expeditiously. With the numerous life events occurring at the same \ntime, he was overwhelmed with his financial responsibilities. He has not had financial \ncounseling. He testified he served his country, often times in harms way and under \ncombat conditions, and was willing to die for it. He loves his country. He is in a better \nfinancial position now. (Tr. 95-96; Answer to the SOR; AE A) \nApplicant provided numerous character letters stating he is responsible, \nprofessional, energetic, trustworthy, mature, calm, confident, efficient, dedicated and \ncharismatic. He adheres to procedures and protocols that protect the mission and some \nof our country\u2019s most sensitive operations. He has unquestionable character, work ethic \nand integrity. He is respected by his peers and is a leader, mentor, and coach. He has \ntrained others on handling sensitive information. As noted by one former military \ncommander, his duty performance was consistently among the very best during years of \nsupporting truly no-fail missions. (Answer to the SOR; GE 2) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility.  \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant had numerous delinquent debts that began accumulating in \napproximately 2018. There is sufficient evidence to support the application of the above \ndisqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant attributed his financial issues to his son being diagnosed with autism and \nthe school district where they lived not having the appropriate resources to help his son \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nreach his potential. He and his wife found a school district where their son\u2019s special needs \nwere met. It was in a rural area where purchasing opportunities were infrequent. When a \nproperty became available, they chose to purchase a small farm where they could have \nanimals, which would also help their son. Because of the expediency of their purchase, \nthey needed time to prepare and repair their current home at the time for sale. During this \nperiod, they were overextended and incurred debts that became delinquent. In addition, \nApplicant\u2019s father fell and was in a coma. Applicant traveled to be with his mother. His \nfather passed away, and he continued to help his mother, anticipating she will come to \nlive with his family. Applicant acknowledged all of his delinquent debts and has \nsystematically resolved each of those alleged in the SOR and others that were not \nalleged. \nApplicant\u2019s debts occurred under unique circumstances that are unlikely to recur \nand do not cast doubts on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. AG \u00b6 \n20(a) applies. \nApplicant made choices that were in the best interest of his son. His son is thriving \nnow that he has the proper therapeutic care and is in the right environment. Applicant\u2019s \nchoices placed him in financial difficulty. These choices were somewhat beyond his \ncontrol. For the full application of AG \u00b6 20(b), Applicant must have acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances. The evidence supports that he fully paid or settled all of the \nSOR debts. He did not ignore his responsibility to address his delinquent debts. As he \nbecame more solvent he was able to pay his debts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and 20(d) apply. There \nis no evidence he has participated in financial counseling, but the evidence supports his \nfinancial problems are under control. AG \u00b6 20(c) therefore has some application.  \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case.

When he purchased the ring, he knew the main stone was moissanite and not a diamond. At the time of purchase, the jeweler\u2019s estimated replacement value for the ring was about $2,600.

He is once divorced. He was married from 2005 until 2014. \nHe has been remarried since October 2017. He has two stepchildren, ages 26 and 23. \nHe earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2015. (Tr. 17-19, 53; GE 1, 2; AE A, C, J-L) \nIn 2017, Applicant purchased a ring for his wife that contained a moissanite main \nstone for about $2,000 from a jeweler who is an acquaintance of his. When he \npurchased the ring, he knew the main stone was moissanite and not a diamond. At the \ntime of purchase, the jeweler\u2019s estimated replacement value for the ring was about \n$2,600. In February 2017, Applicant insured two rings under a personal property policy \nwith an insurance provider (Insurance Provider). Neither of the rings he covered under \nthis insurance policy contained a main stone that was moissanite. (Tr. 20-23, 45-53; \nAnswer; GE 1-9, 14) \nIn February 2019, Applicant\u2019s wife lost the moissanite ring at a theme park. On \nFebruary 8, 2019, pursuant to his personal property insurance coverage, Applicant filed \na fraudulent insurance claim with the Insurance Provider to cover the loss of the ring. \nHe falsely claimed that the ring his wife lost contained a main stone that was a two-carat \ndiamond and falsely claimed its value at about $18,000. At the time, he knew that he \nwas misleading the Insurance Provider by inflating the value of the lost ring. The \nInsurance Provider suspected that the lost ring was a moissanite ring rather than a \ndiamond ring, so it asked him to provide the original purchase receipt for the ring. \nApplicant forged the ring\u2019s purchase receipt to further his false claim. The receipt he \nforged claimed that he paid about $19,000 for a two-carat diamond ring. The Insurance \nProvider also obtained a copy of the actual receipt and valuation of the moissanite ring \nfrom the seller. In April 2019, when the Insurance Provider confronted him with the \nvaluation discrepancy between the moissanite ring he lost and the two-carat diamond \nring he claimed he lost, he falsely claimed that he did not know the main stone on the \nring he lost was not a diamond. He also later changed his story and told the Insurance \nProvider that he made a mistake and made a claim for the wrong ring. (Tr. 20-23, 45-53; \nAnswer; GE 1-9, 14) \nThe Insurance Provider referred the claim to the relevant state insurance fraud \ndivision, and it investigated the matter. Based upon the insurance fraud division\u2019s \ninvestigation, on June 26, 2019, the relevant state prosecutor\u2019s office charged Applicant \nwith fraudulent insurance act, a felony, and forgery, also a felony. In September 2019, \nhe pleaded guilty to lesser misdemeanor charges of false or fraudulent insurance claim \nand forgery. In November 2019, the court convicted him of these misdemeanor charges, \nsentenced him to 544 days in jail (all suspended), placed him on probation for two \nyears, fined him $1,400, and required him to take a moral reconation therapy course. \nHe also must notify the relevant state insurance department before filing any future \ninsurance claim. He has satisfied all the sentencing requirements. Before this \nconviction, he had no prior criminal history.

He further testified that the claims adjuster informed him that inflating \nthe value of the diamond in the engagement ring would make him whole for his loss. He \ndid not provide this excuse for inflating the value of the ring during the Insurance \nProvider\u2019s investigation or the state insurance fraud division\u2019s investigation. He claimed \nthat he may have made this claim to the judge when he was sentenced, but he also \ntestified that he could not recall if he did or not. During his testimony, he could not \nadequately explain why he discussed the valuation of a diamond with the claims \nadjuster when he knew the ring he lost contained a moissanite stone. The first time this \nexplanation of following the claims adjuster\u2019s advice to overvalue appears in the record \nis on his August 2020 Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP). \nHe provided no corroborating evidence for this explanation. He could not provide the \nclaims adjuster\u2019s name. Based upon my observation of him during his testimony, the \nlate timing of this explanation, the lack of corroboration, and his inconsistent excuses to \njustify his behavior, I find his explanation that a claims adjuster for the Insurance \nProvider advised him to inflate the value of the ring lacks credibility. (Tr. 20-23, 45-53; \nAnswer; GE 1-9, 14) Any adverse information not alleged in the SOR will not be \nconsidered for disqualification purposes; however, it may be considered in assessing an \napplicant\u2019s credibility; in evaluating an applicant\u2019s evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or \nchanged circumstances; in considering whether the applicant has demonstrated \nsuccessful rehabilitation; and in applying the whole-person concept. (ISCR Case No. \n15-07369 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 16, 2017)). \nApplicant\u2019s former brother-in-law opened, placed balances on, and became \ndelinquent on numerous financial accounts in Applicant\u2019s name without his permission \nor consent. There were 15 delinquent accounts totaling about $28,000. These \nfraudulently opened accounts are alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b through 2.p. Applicant claimed \nthat he first became aware of these accounts in early 2019. However, he did not realize \nthat his former brother-in-law was responsible until sometime after he submitted his e-\nQIP in August 2020, but before his security interview in April 2021. He confronted his \nbrother-in-law, who confessed to the identity theft. Applicant did not file a police report \nbecause he did not want his former brother-in-law to face criminal charges. Instead, he \nand his brother-in-law have either paid the relevant SOR accounts or are in the process \nof repaying them. All the relevant SOR accounts have either been resolved or are being \nresolved. Applicant believes that his former brother-in-law found Applicant\u2019s personal \ninformation in Applicant\u2019s house. He now secures his personal information in a safe, \nand, other than dealing with these accounts, he no longer associates with his former \nbrother-in-law.

(Tr. 20-23, 37-39, 49-50; AE A-J) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.

Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct  \nThe security concern for criminal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about an Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following is potentially applicable: \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nIn 2019, Applicant engaged in criminal conduct when he filed a fraudulent \ninsurance claim and forged a document in furtherance of that claim. After criminal \ncharges were filed, he pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges of false or fraudulent \ninsurance claim and forgery. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying \ncondition. \nConditions that could mitigate criminal conduct security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 32. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nWhile it has been almost four years since Applicant filed his false insurance claim \nand forged a document, I note that his criminal acts included a sustained commitment to \ndishonesty and untruthfulness. Furthermore, his testimony that a claims adjuster for the \nInsurance Provider advised him to inflate the value of his claim lacks credibility. I believe \nhe is being untruthful about a material fact relevant to a security clearance adjudication. \nProviding untruthful material information in a security clearance adjudication is a \ncriminal offense under 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1001. Therefore, Applicant continues to engage in \ncriminal behavior, undercutting his efforts at mitigation under AG \u00b6 32(a) and AG \u00b6 \n32(d), which require the passage of time without recurrence of criminal acts. Given the \nrecency of criminal activity and his continued dishonesty, AG \u00b6 32(a) does not apply. \nThere is evidence that Applicant has met some of the elements of AG \u00b6 32(d), \nsuch as job training, a good employment record, compliance with the terms of his \nsentence, volunteering, and working on a master\u2019s degree. However, these factors are \noutweighed by Applicant\u2019s continued untruthfulness to attempt to excuse his criminal \nacts. He has not provided sufficient evidence of successful rehabilitation. AG \u00b6 32(d) \ndoes not apply. He has not mitigated the criminal conduct security concerns. \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) deceptive or illegal financial practices such as embezzlement, \nemployee theft, check fraud, expense account fraud, mortgage fraud, filing \ndeceptive loan statements and other intentional financial breaches of trust. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nApplicant filed a fraudulent insurance claim involving the intentional financial \novervaluation of his personal property. He also forged a document that evidenced a \nfinancial transaction. He had 16 financial accounts that were either delinquent or had \nbeen delinquent, totaling about $28,000. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above \ndisqualifying conditions. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nWith respect to Applicant\u2019s fraudulent insurance claim and forgery, for the same \nreasons I referenced in my analysis of this behavior under Guideline J, I cannot find that \nthis behavior is unlikely to recur, and that it does not cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. None of the Guideline F mitigating conditions apply \nto this behavior. \nWithout Applicant\u2019s consent, his former brother-in-law opened and made charges \non the accounts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b through 2.p. He has worked with this former \nbrother-in-law to pay or make payments on those accounts. He has a reasonable basis \nto dispute those debts and provided evidence of his actions to resolve the issue. I find in \nhis favor with respect to those allegations pursuant to AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(d), and \n20(e). Applicant resolved the judgment listed in SOR \u00b6 2.q by paying it prior to the \nGovernment issuing the SOR. I find in his favor with respect to this allegation pursuant \nto AG \u00b6 20(d). \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines J and F in my whole-person analysis. I have also \nconsidered Applicant\u2019s positive character references, volunteer activities, good job \nperformance, job training, and continuing education. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the criminal conduct or financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.b-2.q: \nFor Applicant \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The SOR contains two delinquent Department of Education (DOE) student loan accounts in collection, totaling $109,663. The accounts were opened in 2016 and became delinquent in December 2018. Applicant is 45 years old, single, and has never been married. He has no children. After five years of college, he received a bachelor\u2019s degree in education in 2001. He collected several college credits from August 2006 to June 2008, and from August to October 2012, but received no degree. (Tr. 6-7) In 2015, Applicant received a digital marketing certificate and a web development certificate in 2019. (GE 1 at 11; Tr. 5-6) He applied and received approximately $69,134 in seven student loans between 2005 and February 2008 to finance his education. (GE 2 at 4-7). In June 2016, six of the student loans were apparently assigned to the DOE (GE 2 at 5; GE 3 at 2), and are alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1b as collection accounts. Applicant has been continuously employed since January 2016 as a program analyst with three different contractors. His professional career before and during his current job includes working as a short-sale realty negotiator from October 2015 to April 2018. Before the realty job, Applicant was unemployed for about three months from August 2015 to October 2015, when the contract for a job Applicant was scheduled to begin was abruptly eliminated. From July 2001 to August 2015, he was a teacher and a part-time mentor from November 2009 to October 2010. (GE 1 at 1",

Bayer, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Ryan C. Nerney, Esq. \n06/30/2023 \nDecision \n \nMASON, Paul J., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant knew when he stopped making payments on the two delinquent \nstudent loan accounts in 2016, that they would become delinquent, notwithstanding his \nunclear views of the charged-off status of the accounts. His primary reason for not \naddressing the debt was that, even though he considered his credit would suffer from \nhis failure to address the charged off debts, his credit status would eventually recover. \nBased on the documented evidence showing: (1) that he restored the two listed debts to \na rehabilitative status in June 2022; (2) that he has maintained regular monthly \npayments on an unalleged student loan account since 2019; and (3) that he has a \nfavorable job performance reputation, Applicant has overcome the security concerns \nremaining under the financial considerations guideline. Eligibility for security clearance \naccess is granted.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn April 16, 2018, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) for security clearance eligibility so that he could work \nfor a defense contractor. In September 2021, he provided a personal subject interview \n(PSI) to an investigator from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM).

On January 20, 2022, the \nDefense Counterintelligence Security Agency (DCSA) Consolidated Adjudications \nServices (CAS) could not make the necessary affirmative finding to grant Applicant\u2019s \nsecurity clearance and issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him detailing security \nreasons under the financial considerations guideline (Guideline F). The action was \ntaken under the DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective in the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nOn March 7, 2022, Applicant provided an answer denying the two allegations of \nthe SOR without explanations. A notice of hearing was issued on March 23, 2023 for an \nApril 12, 2023 hearing. The hearing was held by Microsoft Teams as scheduled. \nThe Government\u2019s three exhibits were entered into evidence without objection. \nApplicant presented no exhibits. He testified. After the hearing, the record remained \nopen until April 20, 2023 for Applicant to submit post-hearing exhibits. Attached to an \nemail dated April 20, 2023, he submitted six post-hearing exhibits. Because Applicant \nsent the exhibits to the wrong email address, I did not receive the exhibits until May 25, \n2023. With no objection to the exhibits, they were admitted into evidence. The transcript \nin this case was received on May 1, 2023. The record in this case closed on May 25, \n2023. \nFindings of Fact \nThe SOR contains two delinquent Department of Education (DOE) student loan \naccounts in collection, totaling $109,663.

He collected several college credits from August 2006 to June 2008, and from \nAugust to October 2012, but received no degree. (Tr. 6-7) In 2015, Applicant received a \ndigital marketing certificate and a web development certificate in 2019.

He has no prior \nmilitary history. (GE 1 at 13 -19, 31; Tr. 7) \nReasons for Delinquent Student Loans \nIn January 2012, Applicant had neck surgery and his medical bills began to \nmount over the next three years until they reached their highest level in 2015. In 2013, \nhis growing indebtedness motivated him to enroll in financial counseling, which lasted \nabout a year. His financial difficulties in 2014 resulted in a collection agency garnishing \nhis wages for one account which he settled in January 2016. Applicant recalled his \nrising debt in 2015 was exacerbated by his inability to keep his mortgage payments \ncurrent and caused him to exhaust his savings account. (Tr. 28-31, 34-37) \nIn January 2016, Applicant started working as a program analyst on a \ntemporary basis with a previous contractor-employer of his current contractor-employer. \n(GE 1 at 13; Tr. 40-43) He also started other part-time jobs in information technology \n(IT) and web site development in September 2016 and worked in those positions \nthrough April 2018. Then, he moved out of his relative\u2019s home into an apartment with a \nroommate. (GE 1 at 13-19; Tr. 41-44) \nAfter the temporary job as program analyst became permanent in 2017, he \nbegan to fix his credit history by prioritizing his debt payments by addressing his \nmedical bills first, then student loans, then credit-card debt. Though his testimony is \nconfusing during his description of when the student loans became delinquent, he \nsuspected that he defaulted on his student loans in 2016, because that is when the \n(listed) loans were charged off, though he did not know about the charge off until 2021. \n(Tr. 38-39, 53) Applicant examined the meaning of \u201ccharged off,\u201d \u201cand I thought it was \njust going to be a hit on my credit because it \u2013 because when I looked at my credit \nscore, like the debts were no longer there.\u201d (Tr. 31, 53) In other words, Applicant \nconcluded that it would damage his credit, but he would recover. \nWhen he moved into his own rental in 2019, he changed his address with the \npost office and he was contacted and paying all the other creditors that he owed except \nfor two the DOE student loan accounts. Applicant interpreted the lack of contact from \nthe DOE as an additional reason that the accounts were charged off. He indicated that \nhe had documentation to verify he had been consistently paying another student loan \nservicer throughout the COVID-pandemic in 2020 and 2021. The Government credit \nreports show that Applicant maintained regular payments with another student loan \nservicer from 2019 to March 2022. (GE 2 at 4; GE 3 at 8). Applicant\u2019s April 17, 2023 \npersonal financial statement (PFS) shows that he was paying $199 monthly on the \nstudent loan he testified about. (GE 2, GE 3; Tr. 28-32, 34-37, 49; AE C) The two \nstudent loans reappeared in his 2020 or 2021 credit report as delinquent. (Tr. 39, 51) \nApplicant\u2019s testimonial responses to the delinquent status of the two DOE \naccounts became clear: (1) when he replied that he was aware that the two loans \nbecame delinquent when he stopped making payments on them around 2017; (2) when \n3 \n\n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhe replied that he had not been paying on the two loan accounts for years; and (3) when \nhe conceded that he had not contacted the DOE about the loans for several years. (Tr. \n54-55) \nIn September 2021, Applicant provided a PSI to an investigator from OPM. He \nrecalled discussing his financial troubles he was having in 2015, but he did not recall \nconversing about the two DOE student loan accounts. (Tr. 56-57) \nI find no earlier testimonial support for Applicant\u2019s claim that he initiated contact \nwith the DOE in January 2021. (Tr. 58) Rather, he testified that toward the end of 2021, \nhe initiated the process of rehabilitating the two DOE loans by asking the DOE what he \nneeded to do to activate the rehabilitation process. (Tr. 52) He began by submitting a \npersonal financial statement (PFS) to the agency addressing all his earnings and \nfinancial obligations. (Tr. 55) In February 2022, the DOE offered him a payment plan \nwhich called for two months of payments. Applicant provided documentation confirming \nthat on June 21, 2022, the DOE notified him that he had successfully rehabilitated the \ntwo defaulted student loan accounts. (Tr. 55-57; AE A) Applicant claimed that after he \nsold his house in 2021, he applied some of the $70,000 profit to the two listed student \nloans. While he indicated he could provide documentary proof of payments (Tr. 45, 58), \nnone was provided. \nApplicant\u2019s father passed away in March 2020. He moved from his apartment in \nthe local area to his father\u2019s home in another location of the state to assist his youngest \nsister finish high school and prepare for college. For an unknown period of time, he \ncontinued to pay the rent on his apartment and the mortgage on his father\u2019s home. \nCurrently, he only pays the mortgage and has a monthly remainder of approximately \n$2,160 after payment of his expenses. He is current on the two listed student loans. \nFollowing the two student loan payments that he made in 2022 to rehabilitate the listed \nloans, he has made no payments since then because of the Government payment \npause due to the COVID-pandemic. The pause will not be lifted until at least June 30, \n2023, or a statutorily defined date thereafter. Applicant will pay $529 and an additional \namount of $222 a month until 2052. (Tr. 59-61; AE A, B, C, F) \nApplicant testified that he has a written budget that he maintains on a regular \nbasis. He formulates the budget on a computer spreadsheet that he has had for three \nyears. He was advised to send that budget in with his other post-hearing submissions. \nHe submitted a personal financial statement (PFS) on February 17, 2023. (AE C) The \nGovernment credit bureau reports show no additional delinquent debts except for those \nlisted in the SOR. (GE A, GE B) \nCharacter Evidence \nApplicant submitted two character statements. The president of the company \nhas known Applicant since 2020. The president does not supervise his work, but \nreceives regular and favorable reviews about Applicant from his direct supervisor and \nthe customer. Applicant is a valuable member of the team he works with. He was \n4 \n\n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nnominated as employee of the third quarter of 2021. The president considers \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent student loans to be an aberration to his responsible behavior. \nThe president believes that Applicant should be granted a security clearance. (AE D) \nAn administrative officer (AO) who has worked in the Navy for 40 years, and \nholds a security clearance, manages human resources and personnel matters. She has \nknown Applicant professionally since 2017. She has worked with him on several \nfinancial tracking assignments. Applicant is known for his attention to detail and security \nconsciousness. The AO is not familiar with the allegations in the SOR. She is aware that \nafter his father passed, Applicant moved into his father\u2019s home to assist his younger \nsister finish high school and prepare for college in the fall of 2023. The AO believes \nApplicant warrants a security clearance. (AE D) \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines and all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. These guidelines, which are flexible rules of law, are applied together with \ncommon sense and the general factors of the whole-person concept. The protection of \nthe national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(d) requires that \u201c[a]ny \ndoubt concerning personnel being considered for national security eligibility will be \nresolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security decision. \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18. Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \n5 \n\n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nA person\u2019s practice of paying his voluntarily incurred debts is a private matter \nuntil evidence reveals that he is not paying his debts in a timely fashion. Adverse \nevidence from credit reports can usually meet the Government\u2019s obligation of proving \ndelinquent debts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-02403 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015); \nISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) The Government\u2019s credit reports \nestablish that the two student loan debts listed in the SOR became delinquent in 2018. \nThe total amount of debt posted in the SOR is $109,663.  \nAG \u00b6 19. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying include: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe two listed student loans were opened in 2016 and became delinquent \nin December 2018. Though the pause by the DOE in June 2022 has qualified the \nloans for rehabilitation, over three years passed without any documented action by \nApplicant to rectify the delinquent accounts. The lack of action to address the \nloans demonstrates a failure to meet and satisfy debts in a responsible manner. \nAB \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19 (c) apply. \nAG \u00b6 20. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n6 \n\n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s receives only limited mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(a). Though there are \nonly two delinquent student loan debts, they became delinquent in 2018, and he still \nowes more than $109,000, after subtracting his two payments to rehabilitate the \naccounts in June 2022. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) offers little mitigation to Applicant. Following his unemployment for \nthree months in 2015, he has been steadily employed since January 2016. However, he \nadmitted that he was aware that he had defaulted on the student loans when he \nstopped paying them at some time in 2016. While he stressed that he did not discover \nthat the loans were delinquent until late 2021, he knew or should have known much \nearlier that the two debts became delinquent after he stopped making payments. \nAccordingly, he should have contacted the DOE to investigate the status of the \naccounts and begin to address them, or at least keep the Government agency aware of \nwhy he has unable to handle the delinquencies. \nApplicant receives some mitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) for \nparticipating in financial counseling in 2013. Apparently, the year-long counseling \nhelped him to prioritize his financial obligations by addressing his medical debts first, \nthen his student loan debts, then his credit debts. I am unable to give much weight to \nApplicant\u2019s PFS since it is not a budget and is dated five days after the hearing. Though \nhe was aware the listed student loans had gone into default in 2018, he did not act on \nthe debt until late 2021. Even though his repayment of the two student loan debts is in a \npayment-pause, Applicant should realize that if he misses a payment along the current \npayment schedule, the two loans will return to a delinquent status, locking him out of \nanother chance to rehabilitate the loans. \nWhole-Person Concept \nI have examined the evidence under the guideline for financial considerations in \nthe context of the nine general factors of the whole-person concept listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \naccess to classified information must be an overall common-sense judgment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nApplicant is 45 years old. He has been working as a program analyst since \nJanuary 2016.

After his \nfather passed in March 2020, Applicant moved into his father\u2019s house to mentor his \nyoungest sister in reaching her goal of graduating from high school and college. \nApplicant exercised poor judgment in letting his student loans become delinquent in \nDecember 2018. Once he received notification that the loans were delinquent at the end \nof 2021, he took action to rehabilitate the loans. After two payments of $529, the DOE \nnotified him on June 21, 2022 that the loans were rehabilitated. Given the favorable \ncharacter evidence regarding Applicant\u2019s job performance and his respect for \nsafeguarding classified information, he has successfully mitigated the security concerns \nraised by the guideline for financial considerations.  \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for access to \nclassified information.

He thought \nhe was fine to drive home, but he got a flat tire and pulled his car over to the side of the \nroad. The police arrived, smelled alcohol, and asked Applicant to perform a field sobriety \ntest. He failed the test and was arrested. While the court evaluated his case for placement \ninto a diversion program, he was arrested for a second DUI, as set forth below. The court \ndenied his diversion and merged the two cases together. In December 2020, he was \nfound guilty and sentenced to six months in jail, suspended, fined $1,551, and placed on \none year of probation. He was also ordered by the court to complete outpatient alcohol \ntreatment. (Tr. 27-29, 31, 33-34) \nApplicant was arrested in March 2020 and charged with DUI and driving while \nlicense suspended or revoked. (SOR \u00b6 2.b) Applicant went to a bar to celebrate a friend\u2019s \nbirthday. He consumed alcohol, and when he attempted to leave, he hit another car \nparked on the street with the doors open. The police were called and he failed the field \nsobriety test. He registered .138% blood alcohol content (BAC) on the breathalyzer. His \n2020 case was merged with the 2019 case, as set forth above. (Tr. 50-51; GE 5) \nApplicant started alcohol treatment in about May 2020. He testified that he \nsuccessfully completed the alcohol treatment in June 2022, but he had to be readmitted \ninto the program after several months had passed without treatment. He was diagnosed \nwith alcohol use disorder. Applicant continued to use alcohol against medical advice until \nOctober 2020, when he last consumed alcohol. Since that time, he has completely \nabstained from using alcohol. He does not use the services of Alcoholics Anonymous or \nany other alcohol support group to maintain his sobriety. He is required to have an \ninterlock device installed on his car until April 2023. (Tr. 35-40, 51-52, 56-58) \nApplicant first started consuming alcohol at the age of 16. He started to regularly \nconsume alcohol, drinking several beers at one sitting, at the age of 22. He estimated \nthat he consumed about 20 beers per week. Following his first DUI arrest in 2019, he did \nnot stop consuming alcohol, as requested by his attorney, but he did moderate his alcohol \nuse. After his second DUI arrest in 2020, he continued drinking for about seven months \nuntil October 2020, when he made a decision to completely abstain from using alcohol. \n(Tr. 52-58) \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nConditions that may raise financial considerations security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nBased on Applicant\u2019s admissions and credit reports in the record, the Government \nestablished that Applicant has two delinquent accounts totaling about $24,184. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n19(a) and 19(c) apply. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.    \nApplicant bears the burden of production and persuasion in mitigation. An \napplicant is not held to a standard of perfection in his or her debt-resolution efforts or \nrequired to be debt-free. \u201cRather, all that is required is that an applicant act responsibly \ngiven his circumstances and develop a reasonable plan for repayment, accompanied by \n\u2018concomitant conduct,\u2019 that is, actions which evidence a serious intent to effectuate the \nplan.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-02903 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 9, 2017): See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n13-00987 at 3, n. 5 (App. Bd.

Notwithstanding these events \nthat impacted his finances, Applicant must demonstrate that he acted responsibly under \nthe circumstances. He admitted that he had hired a consumer credit company, and after \nreaching a settlement, he had made two payments out of an estimated 30 payments to \nresolve his largest delinquent debt. The second delinquent debt remains unresolved. \nIt is clear from the record that Applicant made several poor decisions which placed \nhim into a precarious financial quandary. His overspending and criminal conduct are \ncertainly behaviors within his control. He earns $93,500 annually from his employer. He \nadmitted that he had $1,000 net monthly remainder after paying his monthly expenses. \nDespite this monthly net remainder, he has only recently made two out of 30 payments \nto one delinquent creditor, which does not demonstrate a steady track record of \npayments, and he has not accepted a settlement or arranged payments on the second \ndelinquent account. He also has ample money in reserves, such as $175K in his 401(k). \nThere is minimal evidence that his financial problems are being resolved or are under \ncontrol because Applicant failed to provide documentary evidence that he has paid, or is \npaying his delinquent debts. Overall, I find that Applicant has not demonstrated that he \nacted responsibly to address his financial delinquencies. He did not provide sufficient \nevidence to mitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption \nAG \u00b6 21 describes the security concern about alcohol consumption, \n\u201cExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.\u201d  \nAG \u00b6 22 provides conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying as follows: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder;  \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder; and \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional (e.g., \nphysician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical social \nworker- with alcohol use disorder. \nApplicant was arrested twice for DUI arrests, in 2019 and 2020, and he was \nsubsequently diagnosed with alcohol use disorder. The record evidence establishes AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 22(a), 22(c), and 22(d). \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 23 lists four conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations; and \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations. \nTo Applicant\u2019s credit, he has abstained from alcohol since October 2020. \nAlthough this is definitely a step in the right direction, it is insufficient to overcome the \nissues raised by his failure to provide treatment records to demonstrate that he is in full \ncompliance with treatment recommendations. He had two relatively recent arrests for \nDUI, and he was unable to abstain from using alcohol per the advice of his attorney. It is \nimportant to note that even after he entered alcohol treatment and was diagnosed with \nalcohol use disorder, he continued to consume alcohol for about seven months against \nmedical advice. In October 2020, he made a decision to stop drinking alcohol altogether. \nHe did not complete his alcohol treatment until June 2022. \nThe state requires Applicant to keep an interlock device installed on his car until \nApril 2023. This requirement demonstrates that the state believes there is a possibility \nthat Applicant will drive again while under the influence of alcohol, and the interlock device \nis there to prevent that from happening. I find that more time is needed to demonstrate \nsuccessful rehabilitation, and to show that future alcohol-related misconduct is unlikely to \nrecur. Guideline G security concerns are not mitigated. \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern related to the criminal conduct guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 \n30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 31 lists conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. Three of these apply: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness;  \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted; and \n(c) individual is currently on parole or probation. \nAG \u00b6 32 lists two conditions that could mitigate the security concerns: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nThere is no evidence of additional misconduct. Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct is \nrelated to his two alcohol-related arrests cited under Guideline G. It is unfortunate that he \nfailed to learn from his past mistakes and was arrested a second time for DUI only six \nmonths after his first DUI arrest. Applicant is still required by the state to drive with an \ninterlock device on his vehicle, and he is currently unable to provide evidence that he has \nsuccessfully completed the terms of this requirement. I find that more time is needed to \nensure that he does not repeat his criminal behavior. As such, his criminal behavior \ncontinues to cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Applicant \nfailed to establish mitigation under the above mitigating conditions. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the adjudicative guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered \nthe potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guidelines \nF, G, and J and the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) in this whole-person analysis. \nApplicant has failed to demonstrate that he has acted responsibly to address and \nresolve his financial delinquencies. His lack of action reflects poor judgment and \nunreliability. He is still required to drive with an interlock device on his car until April 2023, \nand I find more time is needed to demonstrate successful rehabilitation. The record \nevidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability \nfor a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the \nsecurity concerns arising under Guideline F, financial considerations, Guideline G, \nalcohol consumption, and Guideline J, criminal conduct. Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline G: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a and 2.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a: \nAgainst Applicant \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_______________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, I conclude \nthat it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security for Applicant to have \na security clearance.

Department Counsel offered Government\u2019s \nExhibits (GE) 1 through 5, all of which were admitted without objection. Applicant \ntestified but submitted no exhibits. At the conclusion of the hearing, I left the record \nopen to allow him the opportunity to submit documentation in support of his case. On \nNovember 14, 2023, Applicant submitted three documents, which are marked as \nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A, B, and C, and admitted without objection. The record closed \non November 14, 2022. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on November 3, \n2022. \nAmendment to the SOR \nDuring his hearing testimony, Applicant disclosed an alcohol-related offense from \n1999 that had not been previously revealed. Department Counsel therefore moved to \namend the SOR under \u00b6 E.3.1.17 of the Directive to add the offense under Guideline G. \nSOR \u00b6 1.c was added as follows: \n1.c. You were arrested and charged with Driving Under the Influence in \n[City, State] in 1999. \nThe amendment was accepted without objection, and Applicant did not request \nan opportunity to provide additional evidence about the new allegation. (Tr. 56) \nFindings of Fact \nIn his SOR Response, Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b, and provided a \nnarrative statement. His SOR admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After \na thorough and careful review of the pleadings and evidence submitted, I make the \nfollowing additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is 50 years old. He and his wife have been married for 23 years. He \nhas two daughters and one stepdaughter. He has been employed with a defense \ncontractor since May 2020. (GE 1; Tr. 22) \nApplicant testified that in December 2019, he was in a \u201cdark place\u201d after losing a \njob he had held for the previous 19 years. The COVID-19 pandemic began soon \nthereafter, and he had difficulty finding employment. He was hired by his current \nemployer and clearance sponsor in May 2020 after several interviews. He has never \nheld a clearance before.

He and his wife had \nbeen arguing, and he decided to go for a ride. He went out and had \u201ca couple of drinks.\u201d \nWhile driving home, he swerved to miss a deer, went off the road and hit a pole. \nParamedics and police came to the scene. He failed a field sobriety test and was \narrested for driving while intoxicated (DWI) first offense. (Tr. 20-21; GE 2, GE 3, GE 5) \n(SOR \u00b6 1.a) \nApplicant said he curbed his drinking after that for a few months, but in August \n2020, after another argument with his wife, he left and drove to a nearby town and had \n\u201ca few beers here and there.\u201d He said he swerved over the line and was arrested for a \nsecond offense. (Tr. 21) He later explained that it was a Saturday, and he started \ndrinking around noon, and had a few drinks. He \u201csat in the country a little bit. Decided I \nwould go get something to eat, . . . and the next thing I know, I\u2019m getting pulled over for \nmy second offense.\u201d (Tr. 34) He later pleaded guilty to another charge of DWI first \noffense. (Tr. 35-36; GE 2, GE 4, GE 5) (SOR \u00b6 1.b) \nIn his background interview, Applicant gave more details. He said he started \ndrinking around noon. He went to a local convenience store and purchased two 20-\nounce cans of hard lemonade, and \u201cwent somewhere and sat.\u201d He then drove around \nfor a while and ended up at a sports bar. He ordered wings and had two or three 20-\nounce beers. A friend came in and Applicant had one or two more 20-ounce beers. He \nwas there about two or three hours and went home around 8:30 or 9 pm. He was pulled \nover after the officer observed him weaving. Applicant had a blood alcohol content of \neither .16 or .18 according to the roadside sobriety test. (GE 2) \nApplicant acknowledged that both of his arrests occurred in the aftermath of \narguments with his wife. They have not participated in formal marital counseling, but \nthey have met with some family friends and with their pastor to work through their \ndifferences. Things have improved since he stopped drinking after his most recent \noffense, in August 2020. (Tr. 23) \nAs to SOR \u00b6 1.a, the April 2020 offense, Applicant pleaded guilty to DWI first \noffense in January 2021. He received a 60-day suspended jail sentence, one year of \nprobation, and he was fined $250. He was ordered to participate in an alcohol safety \nawareness program (ASAP) and was ordered to have an ignition interlock device \ninstalled on his car. He completed the classes and probation for that offense. (Tr. 31-33; \nGE 2, GE 3) \nAs to SOR \u00b6 1.b, the August 2020 offense, Applicant pleaded guilty in February \n2021. He was sentenced to six months in jail, of which five months and 10 days were \nsuspended. (GE 4) He said he served eight days in jail after he was credited with \nprevious time served. (GE 2) He was also ordered to participate in the ASAP program \nand to have an ignition interlock device placed on his car. (GE 2, GE 4) \nApplicant reported his April 2020 offense on his May 2020 SCA. (GE 1 at 29) He \ndiscussed both offenses and the resulting sentences in his March 2021 background \nsecurity interview, which, as he noted, occurred shortly before he was to report to jail to \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nserve his sentence. He voluntarily disclosed his August 2020 DWI during the interview. \n(GE 2) \nThe Government\u2019s documentation about the two offenses indicates that the \nignition interlock device was to remain on Applicant\u2019s car for one year after his February \n2021 sentence. (GE 3, GE 4). However, Applicant testified in his October 2022 DOHA \nhearing that the ignition interlock device \u201chas to stay on my car for two years after the \nlast conviction.\u201d (Tr. 26) He noted in his Answer that the interlock device would remain \non his car until February 2023 (two years after his February 2021 sentence date). \n(Answer) He testified that he believed he was still on probation and under ignition \ninterlock requirements until August 2023. (Tr. 26-27, 40) He testified that his license is \nrestricted in that he cannot drive a car that is not equipped with an ignition interlock. (Tr. \n40-41) \nApplicant has not had any ignition interlock violations due to alcohol \nconsumption. He has completed the classroom portion of the ASAP program, but he is \nstill in the ASAP program due to the interlock requirement. (Tr. 26-29; AE A) He has had \nno subsequent alcohol-related offenses. (Tr. 36) \nDuring his testimony, Applicant volunteered that he had a prior DUI arrest in \n1999, an offense that he did not list on his SCA. (Tr. 42) He explained that he was taken \nout drinking by friends for his bachelor party the weekend before his wedding. He said \nhe was allowed to drive home afterwards. He was arrested and charged with first \noffense DUI after he ran a stop sign. He later pled guilty, attended ASAP classes, and \nhad a restricted driver\u2019s license for six months. He found new friends and priorities, and \nlater earned an engineering degree. He also stopped drinking for 12 years. (Tr. 52-54) \n(SOR \u00b6 1.c) \nApplicant has \u201cstruggled a bit here and there,\u201d but has tried to remain sober. He \nis not proud of his actions. His relationship with his family, friends, and children has \nimproved. (Tr. 21) He described his August 2020 as a life-changing event. He spent \neight days in jail. He is grateful no one was injured, and he will not drink and drive again \nand hopes never to drink again. He has been sober since his last offense, in August \n2020. (Tr. 29, 37) \nApplicant has attended about half a dozen Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings \nover the last two years, most recently in July 2022. He is prompted to go to meetings \nafter a rough day at work or when arguing over money or things at home. He goes to \nAA meetings instead of going for a drink. He does not have a sponsor and is not \nformally in the AA 12-step program. (Tr. 24-25) He has not had any other alcohol \ncounseling. (Tr. 42) Applicant believes he is an alcoholic. (Tr. 37) \nRecent evaluations reflect that Applicant is regarded as a highly valued \nemployee. He exceeds goals and expectations for his role and he demonstrates \nleadership and effectiveness in managing complex tasks. He has \u201cgrown immensely\u201d in \nhis time with the company and has been instrumental in accomplishing leadership roles \nand assigned tasks.

As the \nSupreme Court held in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard \nindicates that security determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \n484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988) \nThe AGs are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d Under \u00b6 E3.1.14, the \nGovernment must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. \nUnder \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or \nproven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to \nobtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nAnalysis \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nThe security concern for alcohol consumption is set forth in AG \u00b6 21: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 22. The following disqualifying condition is applicable in this case: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with an alcohol \nuse disorder.  \nApplicant was arrested, pled guilty, and was convicted of two DWI offenses in \n2020, and he incurred an earlier DUI in 1999. AG \u00b6 22(a) applies. \nConditions that could mitigate alcohol consumption security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 23. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment; and  \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations.  \nApplicant was arrested twice for DWI in 2020, including once after he submitted \nhis SCA. At the time of the hearing, he remained on probation and his driving was \nsubject to an ignition interlock program until at least February 2023, perhaps August \n2023. These two incidents are recent enough that they remain a security concern, as \nevidenced by the fact that Applicant remained subject to restrictions at the time of the \nhearing. They did not occur under unusual circumstances, indeed, the circumstances \nwere similar in that they occurred after arguments with his wife. Applicant is given some \ncredit for acknowledging his issues with alcohol and for participation in AA and other \ncounseling, and for his sobriety since his most recent offense. But I believe more time is \nneeded for Applicant to demonstrate that his alcohol issues are behind him and that he \nhandles life stresses in a more responsible manner than turning to alcohol. Applicant \nhas also not yet demonstrated a track record of responsible conduct when he is no \nlonger subject to the state\u2019s restrictions. Applicant\u2019s earlier DUI is a factor to be \nconsidered here, but I am more concerned about the recency of his two DWIs than I am \nabout his older offense. With time, he may be able to demonstrate that he is a suitable \ncandidate for eligibility for access to classified information by establishing a longer \nperiod of responsible alcohol use and compliance with the law. He did not establish that \nhis offenses occurred under unusual circumstances, that his alcohol-related misconduct \nis unlikely to recur, or that his behavior no longer casts doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or judgment. AG \u00b6 23(a) and 23(b) do not fully apply to mitigate the \nGuideline G security concerns. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(c): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline G in my whole-person analysis. \nUnder the whole person concept, I credit Applicant\u2019s excellent work record, and \nhis ongoing efforts to address his alcohol issues. But Applicant\u2019s alcohol-related \noffenses are simply too similar and too recent to warrant a finding that they are \nmitigated at this time. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts \nas to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline G: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

The SOR further informed \nApplicant that, based on information available to the government, DoD adjudicators \ncould not make the preliminary affirmative finding it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \nApplicant answered the SOR on March 12, 2023, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. (Answer.) The case was previously assigned to another \nadministrative judge, but reassigned me on August 1, 2023. The Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) had issued a notice of hearing on July 11, 2023, \nscheduling the hearing for August 8, 2023.

(TR at page 40 lines 5~11.). \nDepartment Counsel provided a five-page summary of the facts, supported by nine \nGovernment documents pertaining to Taiwan, identified as HX I. The documents \nprovide elaboration and context for the summary. I take administrative notice of the \nfacts included in the U.S. Government reports. They are limited to matters of general \nknowledge, not subject to reasonable dispute. They are set out in the Findings of Fact. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted all the allegations in SOR. During the course of the hearing, \nthe Government withdrew allegation 1.f. (TR at page 20 line 10 to 21 line 14, at page 28 \nlines 13~16, at page 29 line 10 to page 30 line 15, and at page 40 lines 12~18.) After a \nthorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the \nfollowing findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 64-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been \nemployed with the defense contractor since June of 2005. He has held a security \nclearance since 2008. Applicant has a Ph.D. from an American university. He is married \nto a U.S. citizen, and has two adult U.S.-born, children.

Applicant served as a finance officer, and second lieutenant, in the \nTaiwanese Army from about 1984 to about June 1986, more than 27 years ago. His \nmilitary service was mandatory. (TR at page 16 line 15 to page 17 line 17, and GX 1 at \npage 14.) \n1.b. and 1.c. Applicant\u2019s parents are citizens and residents of Taiwan. They are \nfarmers. His father is 94 years old, and his mother is 84 years old. Applicant has nearly \ndaily contact with his parents by \u201cvideo phone.\u201d They are unaware of, and uninterested \nin, any details about Applicant\u2019s employment.

She is a \n\u201csalesperson for a food company.\u201d Applicant has limited contact with his sister. (TR at \npage 38 lines 13~25, and GX 1 at page 25.) \n1.f. As noted above, this allegation has been withdrawn by the Government. \nNotice \nI take administrative notice of the following facts regarding Taiwan: Taiwan is a \ndemocracy led by a president and parliament selected in multiparty elections. The U.S. \napproach to Taiwan has remained consistent across decades and administrations. We \ndo not support Taiwan independence, but expect cross-Strait differences to be resolved \nby peaceful means. In recent years there have been multiple cases involving illegal \nexport of U.S. restricted dual-use or military technology to Taiwan or by Taiwanese \nnationals and companies. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall \nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \nAnalysis \nGuideline B - Foreign Influence \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in \nAG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. Two are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents and siblings are citizens and residents of Taiwan. The \nevidence is sufficient to raise these disqualifying conditions. \nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered all \nof the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 including: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \nApplicant has limited contact with his parents and siblings, only by iPhone. His \nparents are elderly farmers, and his three siblings work in the food industry. Applicant, \nin fact, participated in a successful counterintelligence and espionage investigation, on \nbehalf of the U.S. Government, which led to the Government withdrawing allegation 1.f. \nForeign Influence concerns are found for Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline B in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. Applicant has a \ndistinguished history of working in the defense industry. He performs well at his job. \n(AppX A.) Overall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the Foreign Influence security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. ~ 1.e:  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nand a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nRichard A. Cefola \nAdministrative Judge \n6 \n",

(Tr. 20-21, \n90; Answer; GE 1 and 2; AE B, M) \nIn April 2013, on his 18th  birthday, police arrested Applicant in State A and \ncharged him with driving while intoxicated (DWI) after they found him asleep in the \ndriver\u2019s seat of his vehicle. He had been drinking at a party that his friends threw for him \nfor his birthday. He drank beer and had at least four shots of whiskey. He blacked out \nbecause of his alcohol consumption. The last thing he remembered from that night was \ntaking shots of whiskey. The next thing he remembered was waking up in jail the next \nmorning. He pleaded guilty to misdemeanor DWI. The court sentenced him to 90 days \nof confinement (all suspended), placed him on probation for 15 months, and ordered \nhim to pay fines and costs. He did not undergo any alcohol counseling or treatment after \nthis incident. He claimed that his probation officer determined that he did not need to \ntake any alcohol counseling after going over his history with alcohol.

He had been consuming beer all day, first on \na boat, and later with his stepbrother at the house where his stepbrother lived. \nApplicant\u2019s stepbrother has a criminal record and, at the time of the hearing, was in \nprison for selling drugs. At some point during the evening, he and his stepbrother got \ninto a verbal altercation that became physical. He and his stepbrother were intoxicated \nwhen they fought. It is unclear from the record whether Applicant or his stepbrother \nstarted the physical portion of the fight. What is clear is that Applicant got the better of \nthe fight. As a result of the fight, Applicant drove his vehicle away from the house while \nhe was intoxicated, and his vehicle became stuck in the mud. He claimed that he drove \naway in his vehicle because his stepbrother would not stop attacking him. Police \nresponded to his stepbrother\u2019s house and to the location where Applicant\u2019s vehicle was \nstuck in the mud.

Applicant \nclaimed that the police used unnecessary and excessive force. He refused a blood draw \nand breathalyzer, but police obtained a warrant to draw his blood and test it for alcohol. \nThe result of his blood test was that he had a .18% blood alcohol content (BAC). The \nprosecutor dropped the assault charge. In October 2018, Applicant pleaded guilty to a \nlesser DWI charge. The court sentenced him to one day in jail and required him to pay a \n$500 fine. He claimed that he has had no contact with his stepbrother in six years and \nhas no plans to interact with him again.

He pleaded no contest to \nthe charge and was convicted. He paid about $900 in court costs and fines. He used \nmarijuana socially one to two times per week while he was in college from 2014 until his \nMarch 2015 arrest.

(Tr. 88-89, 110-115, 122-\n124; AE K-O) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nThe security concern for alcohol consumption is set out in AG \u00b6 21: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 22. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder; and \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder. \nApplicant has two DWI convictions and was convicted of a liquor violation for \npublic intoxication. All three of these alcohol-related criminal charges are sufficiently \ncorroborated by testimony and police records. Applicant acknowledged that he is an \nalcoholic, that he drank too often and too much, and that he often made poor decisions \nwhile he was drinking. The above disqualifying conditions are established, thereby \nshifting the burden to Applicant to provide evidence in mitigation. \nConditions that could mitigate alcohol consumption security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 23. The following are potentially applicable: \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations; \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of relapse, and is making satisfactory progress in a \ntreatment program; and \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with \ntreatment recommendations. \nI find that there is insufficient evidence to show that Applicant assaulted his \nstepbrother. While there is some evidence of this allegation, there is equally compelling \nevidence that he acted in self defense after his stepbrother assaulted him. While police \nreports indicate that he assaulted his stepbrother, those reports rely on his stepbrother\u2019s \naccount of events without providing a reasonable basis for believing that account over \nApplicant\u2019s version of events. Moreover, the prosecutor dropped the assault charge \nagainst him. \nApplicant acknowledged that he has a problem with alcohol. He completed an \noutpatient alcohol-treatment program and is active in AA. He decided to abstain from \nalcohol in May 2022 because of the negative effect it was having on his personal and \nprofessional life. He has not consumed alcohol since then. His decision to abstain \naccords with his treatment recommendations. He has not had a relapse since he \nparticipated in his alcohol-treatment program or since he began attending AA meetings. \nHe testified that he would remain abstinent, and his AA sponsor also believes that he \nwill. He has demonstrated a clear and established pattern of abstinence. These factors \nalso lead me to believe that his alcohol-related incidents are unlikely to recur and do not \ncast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. All the mitigating \nconditions apply. Applicant has mitigated the alcohol consumption security concerns. \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern for criminal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about an Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following is potentially applicable: \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nThere is sufficient evidence through police reports and Applicant\u2019s testimony that \nhe engaged in DWI on two occasions, and he was intoxicated in public on another. The \nevidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying condition, thereby shifting the \nburden to Applicant to provide evidence in mitigation. As I analyzed under Guideline G, \nthere is insufficient evidence that he assaulted his stepbrother. I find in Applicant\u2019s favor \nwith respect to that portion of the SOR allegation under Guideline J. \nConditions that could mitigate criminal conduct security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 32. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nIt has been about three years since Applicant last engaged in criminal behavior. \nMost of his established criminal offenses were alcohol related. He completed treatment \nfor his alcohol problems and still attends AA meetings. He has abstained from alcohol \nfor almost a year. As his alcohol use was the root cause of his criminal activity and that \ncause is no longer present, I find that his criminal behavior is unlikely to recur. After his \nlast criminal incident in 2020, he enrolled in school to continue his education. He has \nbeen involved in volunteer activities and has a good employment record. There is \nsufficient evidence of his successful rehabilitation from engaging in criminal behavior. \nAG \u00b6 32(a) and AG \u00b6 32(d) apply. I find that he has mitigated the criminal behavior \nconcerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nconduct and all relevant circumstances.

I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines G and J in my whole-person analysis. I have considered \nhis positive character references. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the alcohol consumption and criminal conduct security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline G: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

The CAF acted under Executive Order (EO) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines implemented by the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nOn March 23, 2022, Applicant responded to the SOR (Answer). He admitted SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b, but he did not specifically address the allegation under Paragraph 2, \nGuideline J SOR \u00b6 2.a, which referenced SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b.

(SOR \u00b6 1.a) He has also purchased marijuana from about \nJanuary 2004 to June 2021. (SOR \u00b6 1.b) He listed this information on his June 2021 \nsecurity clearance application (SCA) and admitted these allegations in his Answer. (Item \n2; Answer) \nIn August 2021, Applicant participated in a background interview with an \nauthorized DOD investigator. He stated that he first used marijuana in college, and he \nused marijuana on a weekly basis from approximately 2004 to 2008. After college, he \nstopped all use of marijuana when he became involved in the hiring process with his \ncurrent employer. He was aware that he would be required to pass a pre-employment \ndrug test. He passed the drug screen and was hired in October 2009; at which time he \nresumed his use of marijuana, but on a monthly basis. He used marijuana with friends \nand the effects from the marijuana made him feel relaxed. His purchases of marijuana \ndid not cause him to experience financial problems. His monthly use of marijuana \nremained consistent until June 2021. He told the investigator that he stopped marijuana \nuse at that time because he learned that his employer had sponsored him for a DOD \nsecurity clearance. He is aware that using illegal drugs violates federal law and it is \ninconsistent with his employer\u2019s drug policy. He has no intention of using marijuana in the \nfuture. (Item 3) \nApplicant told the investigator that he believed he had enough will power to reject \nmarijuana if it were offered to him because his job is more important to him than using \nmarijuana. He also stated that if he was not in the process of obtaining a DOD security \nclearance, he would continue using marijuana, despite knowing such use violated federal \nlaw and his employer\u2019s drug policy.

(SOR \u00b6 2.a.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for drug involvement and substance \nmisuse is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations.  \nAG \u00b6 25 provides two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase . . . \nThe record establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(c). Applicant used and purchased \nmarijuana from about January 2004 to about June 2021. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from drug involvement and substance misuse. The following mitigating conditions \nunder AG \u00b6 26 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions to overcome the problem, and has \nestablished a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nbeing used; and \n4 \n\n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of \nnational security eligibility. \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply. Applicant has a long history, nearly two \ndecades, of using and purchasing marijuana. He is aware that marijuana use violates \nfederal law and his employer\u2019s drug policy. Just before he was hired, he stopped using \nmarijuana to pass the pre-employment drug test. He passed the drug screen and was \nhired by his employer in 2009. Thereafter he resumed using marijuana on a monthly basis \nuntil June 2021. At this time, he was informed that his employer was going to sponsor \nhim for security clearance eligibility. \nApplicant stopped all marijuana use once he became aware that he was in the \nprocess of obtaining a DOD security clearance. He also admitted that if he were not in \nprocess for a security clearance determination, he would still be using marijuana. \nAlthough I appreciate Applicant\u2019s candid statements, his long history of marijuana use, \nand pattern of poor choices demonstrate that he does not possess the requisite traits of \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment that are necessary for all DOD security \nclearance holders. Applicant failed to mitigate the drug involvement and substance \nmisuse security concerns. \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern related to the criminal conduct guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 \n30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 lists conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. One potentially applies: \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an\nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of\nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted.  \n \n \nThe record evidence establishes Applicant possessed, purchased, and used \nmarijuana on multiple occasions from about January 2004 to about June 2021. Each time \nhe possessed marijuana he committed a federal criminal offense. AG \u00b6 31(b) applies. \nAG \u00b6 32 lists two conditions that could mitigate the security concerns: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nAs discussed previously, the criminal conduct security concerns are not mitigated \nfor the same reasons that the drug involvement and substance misuse security concerns \nare not mitigated. Applicant regularly possessed and used marijuana despite knowing \nsuch use violated federal law and his employer\u2019s drug policy. He has been actively \ndeceiving his employer for over a decade after being hired and resuming his use of \nmarijuana. As such, his behavior continues to cast doubt on his current reliability and \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. Applicant failed to establish \nmitigation under the above mitigating conditions. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guidelines H and J and \nthe factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) in this whole-person analysis. \nApplicant has shown that his personal interests come first, even if his preferences \nviolate rules, laws, and regulations. He was aware that he should not use illegal drugs, \nbut he continued to do so for over a decade after his employer hired him in 2009. I find it \npossible that Applicant would also be willing to deceive the government by resuming \nmarijuana use if he were to be issued a DOD security clearance. He is not trustworthy or \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n______________________ \ndependable; characteristics that are required for individuals entrusted with our nation\u2019s \nsecrets. Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case, I conclude Applicant has not met his burden of proof \nand persuasion. He failed to mitigate the drug involvement and substance misuse and \ncriminal conduct security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b.: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a.: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, I conclude \nthat it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The SOR alleges one debt charged off for $43,150. The debt is reflected in a credit report dated July 14, 2021. (GX 2) In Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he did not admit or deny the debt but offered an explanation for it. I have treated his explanation as a denial. Applicant is a 50-year-old marine electrician employed by a defense contractor since September 2009. He graduated from high school in June 1992. He married in June 1996, divorced in September 1999, and remarried in May 2009. He has two children, ages 20 and 14. He received a security clearance in October 2009. Applicant\u2019s base income, based on a 48-hour work week, is about $75,000 per year. He usually works 50 or 60 hours per week, making his annual income about $90,000 (Tr 14-15) His wife starting working part time three or four months ago. The record does not reflect her income. (Tr. 15) He testified that his net monthly remainder after paying his debts is about $200 when he is working a 48-hour week and about $600 when he is traveling and working longer hours. (Tr. 33) Applicant purchased his family home in 2006 for $283,000, financed with two mortgage loans. One of the loans was an adjustable-rate loan, on which the payments initially were about $200 per month. By 2019, the payments had increased to about $800 per month, which he could not afford. His last payment on the debt was in July 2019. (GX 5 at 5) He contacted the lender in December 2019 and applied for relief under the Making Home Affo",

On \nNovember 30, 2021, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \nalleging security concerns under Guideline F.

At Applicant\u2019s request, the hearing was postponed until January 24, 2023. At the \nrequest of Applicant\u2019s program manager, the hearing was postponed again based on \noperational necessity, and it was rescheduled for March 16, 2023. I convened the \nhearing as rescheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 5 were admitted in \nevidence without objection. Applicant testified but did not present the testimony of any \nother witnesses or submit any documentary evidence. I kept the record open until \nMarch 31, 2023, to enable him to submit documentary evidence. He timely submitted \nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through D, which were admitted without objection. The \nscreenshots submitted as AX B and C appear to be the same transaction, i.e., a $100 \npayment to the same bank on March 29, 2023. Applicant\u2019s cover letter is marked and \nadmitted as AX D because part o\n f it is testimonial. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on \nMarch 27, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nThe SOR alleges one debt charged off for $43,150. The debt is reflected in a \ncredit report dated July 14, 2021. (GX 2) In Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he did not \nadmit or deny the debt but offered an explanation for it. I have treated his explanation as \na denial. \nApplicant is a 50-year-old marine electrician employed by a defense contractor \nsince September 2009. He graduated from high school in June 1992. He married in \nJune 1996, divorced in September 1999, and remarried in May 2009. He has two \nchildren, ages 20 and 14.

(Tr. 33) \nApplicant purchased his family home in 2006 for $283,000, financed with two \nmortgage loans. One of the loans was an adjustable-rate loan, on which the payments \ninitially were about $200 per month. By 2019, the payments had increased to about \n$800 per month, which he could not afford. His last payment on the debt was in July \n2019. (GX 5 at 5) He contacted the lender in December 2019 and applied for relief \nunder the Making Home Affordable Program. (AX A) He testified that he asked the \nlender about his application in January 2020 and was informed that the lender had not \nreceived it. He submitted a second application in January and was informed in February \nthat this application had not been received. (Tr. 18-19) He did not inquire further until he \nwas interviewed by a security investigator in early 2021. (Tr. 21) All his interactions with \nthe lender have been telephonic conversations, without any written corroborating \ndocumentation.

He explored the possibility of refinancing the first mortgage loan and using his \nequity in the home to pay the charged-off debt, but he was informed by the lender that \nhe could not qualify for refinancing because the charged-off debt was on his credit \nreports. (Tr. 24) \nAfter the hearing, Applicant submitted a statement stating that he had negotiated \na payment plan with the lender for the charged-off debt, providing for monthly payments \nof $100 per month. He stated that the lender would not provide documentation of the \npayment plan because the debt was still in a charged-off status. (AX D) He provided \ndocumentation of a $100 payment to the lender on March 29, 2023. (AX B; AX C) \nApplicant\u2019s credit report from March 2023 reflects a telecommunications account \nthat is past due for $377. The account was opened in April 2003, and the last activity on \nthe account was in September 2021. The credit report reflects that the debt is disputed, \nbut it does not reflect the basis for the dispute. (GX 5 at 5) The debt is not alleged in the \n1\nSOR. \nIn January 2023, Applicant obtained an unsecured loan of $28,821, with monthly \npayments of $875. He used the proceeds of this loan to pay off several credit-card \naccounts. (Tr. 27) In addition to the charged-off debt alleged in the SOR and the \ndelinquent telecommunications account, his most recent credit report reflects that he is \ncarrying a balance of $11,739 on six revolving accounts and $32,699 on two installment \naccounts, all of which are current. His total monthly payments on all these open \naccounts total about $1,683. (GX 5 at 3) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \n1  Conduct not alleged in the SOR may be considered to assess an applicant's credibility; to evaluate an \napplicant's evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; to consider whether an \napplicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; to decide whether a particular provision of the \nadjudicative guidelines is applicable; or to provide evidence for whole person analysis ISCR Case No. 03-\n20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006). I have considered the unalleged debt for these limited purposes. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-\n01253 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. \n01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is \nfinancially overextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or \notherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See \nISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence submitted at the hearing establish two \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d) and \nAG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; and \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is established. The delinquent debt alleged in the SOR is recent, but \nit is the only debt alleged. It occurred because Applicant obtained an adjustable-rate \nloan that he could not control. He is unlikely to make that mistake again. Even though \nthe delinquent debt is ongoing, it does not cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is established. Applicant voluntarily obtained an adjustable-rate loan, \nnot fully realizing the potential consequences of his decision, but he could not control \nthe upward adjustments of the interest rate. He was irresponsible by not contacting the \nlender sooner when his payments began to increase, but he acted responsibly by \ncontacting the lender in November 2019 and continuing to seek resolution of the debt. \nHe is financially unsophisticated and did not know how to obtain a decision on his \napplication for financial relief. However, he was persistent and eventually was able to \narrange a payment agreement. \nApplicant\u2019s documentation of the agreement is sparse. When an applicant claims \nthat a debt is being resolved, it is reasonable to expect the applicant to support that \nclaim with documentary evidence supporting that claim. See ISCR Case No. 15-03363 \nat 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 19, 2016). In this case, Applicant submitted documentary evidence \nof his effort to resolve the debt in December 2019 and documentary evidence of a \npayment to the lender in accordance with an agreement. After considering the \ndocumentary evidence of Applicant\u2019s overall financial situation, especially as portrayed \nin the most recent credit report, I found his oral testimony about a payment agreement \ncredible even though it is only partially corroborated by documentary evidence. I am \nconfident that he will continue the make the agreed payments. If he does not, he risks \nreconsideration of his suitability for a security clearance. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person \nanalysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). I have considered that he has \nworked for his current employer and held a security clearance for more than 13 years, \napparently without incident. I have considered that the debt alleged in the SOR and the \ndisputed telecommunications debt that was not alleged are the only significant negative \nfactors in his credit history. He was candid, sincere, and credible at the hearing. After \n6 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nweighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F and evaluating all \nthe evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the \nsecurity concerns raised by the single delinquent debt alleged in the SOR. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): FOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nClearance is granted. \nLeRoy F.

He is divorced and has four children, two with his ex-\nwife, and two with his current girlfriend who resides with him. He has completed two \nyears of college. He is employed by a defense contractor as an Electronic Technician. \nHe is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment. \nApplicant has a history of criminal conduct, drug abuse, alcohol abuse, and \ndishonesty, evidenced by numerous arrests and convictions spanning over most of his \nadult life. (Government Exhibits 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7.) Applicant admits to each of the \nallegations set forth in the SOR. (See Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR.) \nAfter finishing high school, Applicant joined the U.S. Army.  He served in the U.S.\nArmy from June 2009 to December 2016, and held a security clearance.  He received \nan Honorable Discharge for his first six-year tour of service.  He then re-enlisted for a \nsecond two-year tour where most of his problems began.

(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit F.)   \n \nDuring his second tour in the military, Applicant\u2019s excessive alcohol consumption \nand alcohol dependence caused him to be arrested on a number of occasions for \nDriving Under the Influence of Alcohol (DUI). This excessive criminal conduct resulted \nin him being disciplined. (Tr. p. 31-32.) His rank was reduced from an E-4 to an E-1. \nHe was eventually discharged from the Army with an \u201cOther than Honorable\u201d discharge \nin December 2016. (Government Exhibit 7.) Following his discharge, Applicant applied \nfor VA disability. \nHe is currently receiving 100 percent VA disability for his Post \nTraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit F.) \nApplicant explained that he was born and raised in Iowa to a drug and alcohol-\naddicted mother. His father was never in the picture. He experienced a very difficult \nchildhood and still suffers from this trauma. He described bouncing from foster care \nhome to foster care home and always feeling out of place. He witnessed his 11 month \nold sister being molested by one of his foster care parents, and was beaten for trying to \nstop the abuse. As a five or six year old child he described staying in a drug house with \nhis biological mother and being allowed to roam the streets with no supervision. His \nmother was not present and his two older siblings sometimes took care of him. He was \nalso molested at age 5 or 6.

He states that he has received favorable performance evaluations, and has \nbeen promoted for good job performance. He contends that for the past four years, he \nhas greatly improved himself and changed his life for the better. \nGuideline J - Criminal Conduct \nApplicant\u2019s criminal conduct began while he was in the Army. His extensive \narrest history includes six arrests for Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol (DUI), and \nother related charges and convictions. 1.a. In October 2010, Applicant was charged \nwith underaged drinking. He was found guilty and received an Article 15. 1.b.

Applicant states that his criminal conduct occurred because he \nwas young, immature, and made unwise choices while drinking. (Answer to SOR.) \nIn each of the cases listed above, except for the Spousal Abuse and Child \nEndangerment claim, Applicant was found guilty or pled guilty to the charge against \nhim. He was either sentenced to pay a fine, complete an alcohol course, and a driver\u2019s \nlicense suspension; or he was placed in a military diversion program; and/or ordered to \ncomplete an 18 month Traffic, Alcohol, and Awareness School for multiple offenders. \n(Government Exhibits 4, 5, 6, and 7.) \nGuideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nApplicant has used a variety of illegal drugs while possessing a security \nclearance. In his answer to the SOR, he admitted using cocaine, but denies ever using \nany other illegal drug. (Answer to SOR.)

(Tr. p. 57-69, and \nGovernment Exhibit 3.) 2.a. Medical records from the facility reflect that from 2014 until \nNovember 2018, Applicant used cocaine with varying frequency, including at times \ndaily, while granted access to classified information. 2.b. From 2012 until at least \nSeptember 2018, he used marijuana with varying frequency, while granted access to \nclassified information. 2.c.

Applicant has \nalso on occasion, between 2017 and 2018, shown up late for work under the influence \nof illegal drugs and alcohol. (Government Exhibit 3.) \nGuideline G - Alcohol Consumption \nApplicant\u2019s history of alcohol abuse includes at least six arrests for DUI and one \narrest for Underaged Drinking, that all occurred between 2015 and 2018. Applicant\u2019s \nexcessive alcohol abuse was the reason he was administratively separated from the \nArmy and the reason why he received an \u201cOther than Honorable\u201d discharge. After his \ndischarge from the Army, Applicant continued to abuse alcohol. He enjoyed consuming \nalcohol and would often drink while using illegal drugs. He also abused alcohol while \npossessing a security clearance. Applicant denies ever showing up for work late or \nunder the influence of alcohol. 3.b. However, medical records from the treatment \ncenter indicate that on several occasions between 2017 and 2018, he arrived to work \nunder the influence of alcohol and drugs and on occasion was late for work because of \nthis overindulgence. (Government Exhibit 3.) \n3.c. Following his last arrest for DUI in October 2018, Applicant voluntarily \nentered an Alcohol and Drug treatment program for his addictions. Records from the \ntreatment center indicate that from November 29, 2018 to February 27, 2019, he \nreceived inpatient treatment for 90 days and was diagnosed with Alcohol Use Disorder \n(Severe), among other conditions. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit F, and Government Exhibit 3.) \nAfter completing the inpatient treatment program, he attended the one-year outpatient \ntreatment program and successfully completed it on November 26, 2019. (Applicant\u2019s \nExhibit F.) Applicant stated that he last consumed alcohol on October 16, 2019. (Tr. p. \n53.) He states that he has been sober for the past four years. (Tr. p. 54.) His intent is \nto never drink alcohol again. (Tr. p. 69.) \nGuideline E \u2013 Personal Conduct  \nApplicant has a history of dishonesty. Recently, during his security clearance \nbackground investigation, he has been dishonest and untruthful in response to the \nGovernment\u2019s questions on his security clearance application, in his interrogatories, and \nduring the interviews about his past arrests and illegal drug use while possessing a \nsecurity clearance. \nApplicant admits each of the allegations set forth under this \nguideline, except allegations 4.h., and 4.i. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n4.a.

(Government Exhibit 1.) This was a false response. He failed to \ndisclose that he received an \u201cOther than Honorable Discharge\u201d in December 2016. \n(Government Exhibit 7, and Applicant\u2019s Exhibit F.) \n4.b.

This was a false \nresponse. \nHe failed to disclose his extensive arrest history discussed above. \n(Government Exhibits 4, 5, 6, and 7.) \n4.c. Section 23-Illegal Drugs, of the same security clearance application asked \nthe Applicant if in the last seven years he has illegally used any drugs or controlled \nsubstances?

During the same interview on April 11, 2019, with an investigator for the \nDefense Department, Applicant denied being arrested for DUI in February 2017. Only \nafter being confronted by the investigator did he admit to this arrest. (Government \nExhibit 2.) \n4.h. During an interview on August 9, 2021, with an investigator for the Defense \nDepartment, Applicant stated that he had only used cocaine three times and that he had \nnever used drugs while possessing a security clearance.

He was not truthful in answering \nthis question. In fact, the Applicant\u2019s last use of these illegal drugs is discussed above. \n4.j. On at least five to ten separate occasions between 2016 and 2020, Applicant \ndrove a vehicle while knowing that his driver\u2019s license was suspended or revoked. \n(Government Exhibits 4, 5, 6 and 7.) \nApplicant was not truthful when he answered the questions on his security \nclearance application in Sections 22 and 23 discussed above. \nHe should have \nanswered \u201cYes.\u201d He was also not truthful during his interview with the investigator in \nApril 2019, or in his interrogatories in January 2022. Applicant\u2019s deliberate attempt to \ndeceive the Government is unacceptable and shows immaturity, irresponsibility, and \npoor judgment. \nRegarding his history of alcohol and drug abuse, Applicant states that while in \nthe military, he did not receive the help he needed for his addiction. (Tr. p. 67.) Since \ncompleting his inpatient and outpatient treatment programs, he has learned \nmechanisms for self-control. \nHe has also attended Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) \nmeetings, and has been receiving counseling from the VA Substance Abuse program \nthat has been helpful. He states that he now avoids the triggers that have caused him \nto abuse alcohol and drugs in the past. (Tr. p. 56.) He believes he is a changed man. \nIn August 2020, he received full custody of his children and is a very active and involved \nfather who participates in their lives and extracurricular activities. (Tr. p. 58.) He states \nthat he no longer associates with people who abuse alcohol and illegal drugs. His \ngirlfriend who has been with him since 2015, is not a drug user, and has been very \nsupportive in his sobriety. (Tr. pp. 73-74.) \nApplicant\u2019s performance appraisals for the periods from May 1, 2020, through \nApril 30, 2022, reflect ratings of \u201cmeets expectations\u201d and \u201cexceeds expectations\u201d in \nevery category.

(Applicant\u2019s \nExhibit F.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence that \nestablishes controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \n\u201capplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, \nand has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance \ndecision.\u201d \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline J - Criminal Conduct  \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual\u2019s judgement, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matter of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless \nof whether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted or \nconvicted. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 31 contains conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. Neither of the conditions are applicable. \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, \nrestitution, compliance with the terms of parole or probation, job \ntraining or higher education, good employment record, or constructive \ncommunity involvement. \nApplicant\u2019s extensive criminal record aggravated by his alcohol dependence \ndemonstrates poor judgment, immaturity and a total disregard for the law. Applicant\u2019s \nmisconduct was extreme, outrageous, and inexcusable. His most recent conviction was \nin October 2018, a little over four years ago. However, he has not established that he is \nsufficiently reliable and trustworthy to access classified information. His many violations \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nof the law give rise to serious concerns about his judgment, reliability and \ntrustworthiness, both because of the nature of the offenses, and the circumstances \nsurrounding the offenses. The before-mentioned disqualifying conditions have been \nestablished and are not mitigated. \nGuideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse is set forth at AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 25 contains four conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition);    \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession \nof drug paraphernalia;    \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional \n(e.g.., physician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical \nsocial worker) of substance use disorder; and \n(f) Any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 26 contains conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. None of the conditions are applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthis problem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, \nbut not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;  \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and  \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility. \nNone of the mitigating conditions are applicable. Although Applicant\u2019s illegal \ndrug use last occurred in 2018, and Applicant states that his drug abuse has stopped, \nhe used a variety of illegal drugs while possessing a security clearance, in total \ndisregard for DoD policy, procedure and Federal law. He also lied about his drug use \non his security clearance application. This shows immaturity, and an attempt to hide \ninformation from the Government. In fact, at the hearing he claims that he has only \nused cocaine and no other illegal drug, when in fact his medical records show that he \nhas used a variety of illegal drugs. This raises questions as to whether he has actually \nstopped his illegal drug use. He has not shown the requisite good judgment, reliability \nand trustworthiness necessary to be eligible for access to classified information. \nGuideline G - Alcohol Consumption \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Alcohol Consumption is set out \nin AG \u00b6 21: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 22 contains seven conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying. Four conditions may apply: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder; \n(b)  alcohol-related incidents at work, such as reporting for work or duty in \nan intoxicated or impaired condition, drinking on the job, or jeopardizing \nthe welfare and safety of others, regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed with alcohol use disorder;  \n  \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder; and \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional \n(e.g.., physician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical \nsocial worker) pf alcohol use disorder. \nApplicant\u2019s long history of excessive alcohol abuse and dependence raises the \nabove security concerns. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 23 contains conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns: \n(b) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nor does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, \ntrustworthiness or judgement;  \n(c) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations; \n(d) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment and relapse, and is making \nsatisfactory progress in a treatment program; and  \n(e) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and \nestablished pattern of modified consumption or abstinence in \naccordance with treatment recommendations. \nHis extensive history of alcohol dependence, coupled with his illegal drug use fail \nto establish mitigation. Applicant\u2019s extensive history of alcohol consumption reflects \nquestionable judgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness. \nGuideline E- Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for Personal Conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 16. Three are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) \ndeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts \nfrom \nany \npersonnel \nsecurity \nquestionnaire, \npersonal \nhistory \nstatement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine \nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine \nnational security eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary \nresponsibilities;  \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information concerning relevant facts to an employer, \ninvestigator, security official, competent medical or mental health \nprofessional involved in making a recommendation relevant to a \nnational security eligibility determination, or other official government \nrepresentative; and \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may \nnot properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nThere are conditions mitigating security concerns under AG \u00b6 17. However, \nnone of them are applicable here. \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a \nperson with professional responsibilities for advising or instructing the \nindividual specifically concerning security processes.  Upon being \nmade aware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the \ninformation, the individual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is \nunlikely to recur. \nApplicant lied to the Government on his security clearance application, in his \ninterrogatories, and during his interviews with the DoD investigators about his criminal \nhistory, misconduct in the military, and his illegal drug use. He deliberately failed to \ndisclose any derogatory information until he was confronted with it by the investigator. \nOn the security clearance application, he simply lied by answering, \u201cNO,\u201d to the \nquestions, when he knew he should be answering \u201cYes\u201d. This raises serious questions \nabout his credibility. Applicant has not demonstrated that he can be trusted. In totality, \nhis conduct still shows a high degree of immaturity and poor judgment. None of the \nmitigating conditions are applicable here. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) \nthe nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances \nsurrounding \nthe \nconduct, \nto \ninclude \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of \nthe conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of \nthe conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the \npotential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) \nthe likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines J, H, G and E, in my whole-person analysis. Based upon the facts and \nanalysis set forth above, Applicant has failed to provide sufficient evidence to \ndemonstrate that he meets the qualifications for a security clearance. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the Criminal Conduct, Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse, Alcohol Consumption, and Personal Conduct security concerns. \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.i. \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a. through 2.f. \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline G: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 3.a. through 3.c. \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 4, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 4.a. through 4.j. \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted his security clearance application (SCA) on June 17, 2021. \nOn January 14, 2022, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (DCSA CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging \nsecurity concerns under Guideline F, financial considerations. The DCSA CAF acted \nunder Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense (DOD) Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated in \nSecurity Executive Agent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines \n(December 10, 2016). \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant submitted an answer (Answer) to the SOR on February 8, 2022 and \nelected a decision on the written record by an administrative judge of the Defense Office \nof Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). On September 29, 2022, Department Counsel \nsubmitted the Government\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM), including documents \nidentified as Items 1 through 4. DOHA sent the FORM to Applicant on September 30, \n2022, who received the FORM on October 11, 2022. He was afforded 30 days after \nreceiving the FORM to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or \nmitigation. Applicant did not respond to the FORM. The SOR and the Answer (Items 1S \nand 1A, respectively) are the pleadings in the case. Items 2 through 4 are admitted without \nobjection. The case was assigned to me on January 26, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nAfter a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I  make \nthe following findings of fact:  \nApplicant is 41\n  years \n \nold,  married  (December  2017), and  has three sons, ages \n21, 15, and 7. He is a high school graduate and completed one year of college. Since \nDecember 2018, he has worked for a defense contractor. (Item 2.)  \nThe SOR alleged six delinquent debts totaling approximately $25,000. (Item 1S.) \nApplicant admitted those allegations, without comments or explanations. (Item 1A.)  \nDuring his July 20, 2021 Personal Subject Interview (PSI), he was asked about the \nSOR debts. For each debt, he explained that he just \u201cgot behind.\u201d Similarly, for each debt, \nhe intended to contact the creditor and set up a payment plan by late 2021. As of the PSI, \nhowever, he had not yet contacted his creditors. He attributed his financial difficulties to \nliving and working in State A, that has a very high cost-of-living. To reduce his expenses, \nafter living in State A since 2001, in June 2019 he moved to State B, which he believed \nwould reduce his living expenses. (Items 2 and 3.) He submitted no documents \nevidencing any contacts with his creditors or payment plans.  \nApplicant has 14 accounts that are reported PAYS AS AGREED. The six SOR \ndebts were assigned to collections between 2013 and 2016, and they remain in \ncollections today. (Item 4.)  \nLaw and Policies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are \nflexible rules of law that apply together with common sense and the general factors of the \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwhole-person concept. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, then the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . ..\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security decision.  \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to Guideline F for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nGuideline F notes conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 19. \nThe following condition is applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe SOR debts are established by Applicant\u2019s admissions and the Government\u2019s \ncredit report. Although the record has only one credit report (July 2021), the six SOR \ndebts were assigned to collections between 2013 and 2016, and they remain in \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncollections today. Notwithstanding Applicant\u2019s 14 accounts that are current, the record \nshows a history of not meeting financial obligations. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and19(c) apply. \nGuideline F also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay  \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nI have considered mitigating condition AG \u00b6 20(a). The six SOR debts were \nassigned to collections between 2013 and 2016, which is quite some time ago. But \nthey remain in collections today. They are recurring debts. Applicant\u2019s SOR debts \nare not mitigated by AG \u00b6 20(a). \nI have also considered mitigating condition AG \u00b6 20(d). Applicant has \nexpressed his intention to contact his SOR creditors and establish payment plans. \nHe has not, however, shown any evidence of such contacts or payment plans. The \nAppeals Board has routinely held that it is reasonable to expect applicants to \nproduce documentation supporting their efforts to resolve debts. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 20-00615 at 2 (Jun. 7, 2021). Applicant has not satisfied that basic \nrequirement. His debts are not mitigated by AG \u00b6 20(d). \nThe Whole-Person Concept \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole-person concept. AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and (d)(1)-(9) (explaining the \n\u201cwhole-person\u201d concept and factors). In my analysis above, I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions and the whole-person concept in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. \nApplicant leaves me with questions about his eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For these reasons, I conclude that Applicant did not mitigate the security \nconcerns arising under Guideline F, financial considerations. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n      Subparagraphs 1.a. \u2013 f.:  \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.

Prior to the \nissuance of the SOR, he claimed that he had not had any issues related to his security \nclearance. (Tr. 46-50, 66-67, 93-94; GE 1, 8; AE A, B) \nIn the SOR, the Government alleged Applicant\u2019s five delinquent debts totaling \napproximately $75,000 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.e). These delinquencies consist of \nfederal student loans (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.d) and a small credit-card balance (SOR \u00b6 \n1.e). He admitted the SOR allegations with additional comments. His admissions are \nadopted as findings of fact. The SOR allegations are established through his \nadmissions and the Government\u2019s credit reports. (SOR; Answer, GE 2-6) \nThe delinquent federal student loans totaling about $75,000 listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \nthrough 1.d are being resolved. Applicant opened these student loans in about 2011 to \nfinance his master\u2019s degree classes. He defaulted on his student loans because of a \n2013 increase in his child support obligation from about $250 to about $1,800 per month \nfor his two children from his first marriage. (Tr. 50-56, 65, 67-68, 72-82, 93-94; Answer; \nGE 1-8; AE H-K) \nIn 2013, when Applicant knew he might have financial difficulties, the Department \nof Education (DOE) granted his request for a three-year deferment of his student loan \npayments. He became delinquent on these loans in about May 2016 when his \ndeferment period ended. He acknowledged that he knew he was delinquent in May \n2016. Sometime in early 2017, he contacted the DOE and entered a payment \narrangement to have $500 per month directly debited from his debit card. Later in 2017, \nthis debit card became invalid, but he did not update his form of payment with the DOE, \nso he defaulted on his payment arrangement. He did not update his payment \ninformation because he could not afford the $500 payments at that time. (Tr. 50-56, 65, \n67-68, 72-82, 97; Answer; GE 1-8; AE H-K) \nBeginning in March 2020, all federal student loans were placed in deferment \nstatus because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Applicant defaulted on his student loans \nprior to their placement in this deferment status. Applicant provided documentary \nevidence that, in March 2023, he entered into a Fresh Start agreement with the DOE \nwhereby his student loans were removed from a default status, placed back into good \nstanding, and transferred to a loan service provider. He did not attempt to resolve these \nstudent loans between 2017 and March 2023.

Credit reports corroborate that the student loan accounts are current. He claimed \nhe has since made arrangement with his loan service provider to pay $720 per month \nbeginning in October 2023. He made his first payment to his loan service provider in the \namount of $1,200 ahead of schedule on April 24, 2023. He claimed he will set up \nautomatic withdrawals to make these payments each month, but he cannot do so until \nhis monthly payments are scheduled to begin. (Tr. 50-56, 65, 67-68, 72-82, 93-94, 97; \nAnswer; GE 1-8; AE H-K) \nThe delinquent credit card in the amount of $162 alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e has not \nbeen resolved. Applicant claimed that he believes his first spouse opened this account \nwithout his consent at the tail end of his marriage to her. He claimed that in March 2023, \nhe called the creditor to try to resolve the account, but they could not find it in their \nsystem. He acknowledged that the risk of losing his security clearance factored into his \ndecision to attempt to resolve this debt. He has taken no other action to resolve this \naccount. The credit reports reflect that this account was opened in 2003 (four years \nbefore his divorce from his first wife). This account appears on the August 2020, \nOctober 2020, and March 2021 credit reports. It does not appear on the December \n2021 or March 2023 credit reports. The March 2021 credit report reflects a May 2014 \nlast activity date for this account, so the account may have aged off the December 2021 \nand March 2023 credit reports. He testified that he should have been consistently \nchecking his credit reports so he would have known about this account. He claimed that \nhe now regularly checks his credit reports. He claimed that he can afford to pay off the \naccount and he would have done so if the creditor could locate the account. (Tr. 60-62, \n83-86, 98; Answer; GE 2-4, 7, 8) \nApplicant testified that when he realized his first marriage was ending and that he \nmight have financial issues, he downsized his home and traded in his car for one that \nwas less expensive. He acknowledged that he made a mistake in not communicating \nhis financial issues with the student loan service provider or the DOE. He also testified \nthat he realizes that he should have immediately tried to make a payment arrangement \non his student loans instead of ignoring them. His child support obligation ended in May \n2022, freeing up about $1,800 in monthly income. He claims that he has enough money \nto pay all his bills and he will pay them. The March 2023 credit report does not reflect \nany delinquent debts. He provided a written monthly budget that reflects a monthly \nsurplus of $1,354. His budget does not reflect his student loan payments or the \napproximately $400 per month he provides to his ageing parents, which will significantly \nreduce his surplus. Despite his omission of these significant, regular expenses, he \ntestified that he has over a $1,000 surplus at the end of each month. (Tr. 51-60, 62-63, \n68-72, 90-92; Answer; GE 6; AE E-G) \nApplicant and his spouse have a savings account with a balance of about \n$90,000. However, most of the money in this account is his wife\u2019s, and he and his wife \nhave declined to use that money to pay his individual expenses in the past. He has \nbeen contributing about $200 per month to this joint savings account since about \nAugust 2022. For several months, this $200 monthly amount went directly towards a car \npayment that was titled in his wife\u2019s name.

While he was in default on his student loans, he took several international \nvacations that he claimed that his wife paid for with her money. He claimed that he \nnever asked his wife to help him pay his delinquencies because they were his debts. He \nhas not undergone any financial counseling but claims he is open to doing so. (Tr. 51-\n60, 62-63, 68-72, 87-92, 94-96; Answer; GE 6; AE E-G) \nApplicant\u2019s former supervisor testified that Applicant did well at work while he \nwas reporting to her. She provided him a performance award for his work and claimed \nhe is trustworthy, a good person, and an asset to their employer. A colleague of his \ntestified that he shows integrity, accountability, and a strong work ethic. The colleague \nalso noted that he is an asset to their employer. She claimed that she is aware that he \nhad financial issues after his divorce, but that he has recovered from those issues. She \nthinks highly of him and his family. Both his former supervisor and his colleague opined \nthat he should have a security clearance. He has received positive performance \nreviews, promotions, and performance awards at work. (Tr. 32-45, 48-49; AE C, D) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant\u2019s federal student loans totaling about $75,000 were in default beginning \nin 2016. A security clearance represents an obligation to the Federal Government for \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe protection of national secrets. Accordingly, failure to honor other obligations to the \nGovernment has a direct bearing on an applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability \nto protect classified information. ISCR Case No. 14-03358 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2015). \nWhile his student loans were no longer considered delinquent in March 2020 because \nof the COVID-19 deferment, that action does not excuse previously delinquent student \nloans such as these. See ISCR Case No. 20-01527 at 2 (App. Bd. June 7, 2021). \nApplicant also has an unresolved credit card with a small balance that has been \ndelinquent since about 2014. The above listed conditions are made applicable by SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b, thereby shifting the burden to Applicant to provide evidence in \nmitigation. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nBeginning in March 2020, Applicant\u2019s student loans were in a deferment status \nbecause of the pandemic. However, he defaulted on these loans prior to this deferment. \nWhen student loans are automatically placed in a deferment status after they are in \ndefault, Applicant\u2019s past inactions are not excused in the context of security clearance \neligibility. Despite being relieved of his $1,800 child support obligations nearly a year \nago, he took his first voluntary action to resolve his student loans only two months ago. \nHe made his first attempt to resolve his still unresolved credit card two months ago. \nWhile his written monthly budget shows a surplus, that budget is inaccurate because it \ndoes not consider significant expenses. Given their history of not paying Applicant\u2019s \ndelinquent expenses with their joint income, despite the large amount of money in their \njoint savings account, I do not consider that money to be a safety net for Applicant. His \nfinancial issues occurred recently. He has not established a track record of financial \nresponsibility. He has not provided sufficient evidence that the behavior that led to his \nfinancial issues is unlikely to recur.

These conditions were largely beyond his control. For AG \u00b6 \n20(b) to be applicable, he must also provide sufficient evidence that he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances. He has not done so. Instead of asking his wife for \nhelp with his financial issues, he took expensive international vacations that his wife \nfunded. Despite having about $1,800 per month in income freed up beginning in May \n2022, instead of addressing his SOR debts, he used his income to pay off his wife\u2019s car \nand then to contribute to a joint savings account that was already well funded. He did \nnot attempt to contact the DOE between 2017 and March 2023. He did not attempt to \ncontact the creditor for the credit card between 2014 and March 2023. Despite believing \nthat his ex-wife may have opened the account without his consent, he did not dispute \nthe account with the creditor or the credit reporting agencies. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not \napply. \nApplicant claimed that the timing of the actions he took to address his SOR debts \nwas based upon having the available income. However, the approximately 10-month \ndelay between the end of his child support obligations and his resolution attempts \nundermine this premise. His financial contributions towards his wife\u2019s vehicle and their \njoint savings account also detract from this claim. He acknowledged that his desire to \nprotect his security clearance motivated him to take the steps he did to address the \nSOR debts, and he waited until well after the SOR was issued. An applicant who begins \nto resolve security concerns only after having been placed on notice that his or her \nclearance is in jeopardy may lack the judgment and willingness to follow rules and \nregulations when his or her personal interests are not threatened. See, e.g., ISCR Case \nNo. 17-04110 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 26, 2019). These considerations undermine his ability \nto show that he acted in good faith to resolve the SOR debts. AG \u00b6 20(d) does not \napply. \nApplicant testified that he does not believe he owes the credit-card account \nbecause he assumes his ex-wife opened it without his consent. This possible fraud is a \nreasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of this account. However, he has not \nprovided evidence of actions he took to resolve the dispute. He did not provide evidence \nthat he confronted his ex-wife about whether she opened the account in his name. He \ndid not dispute the account with the creditor or the credit reporting agencies. He did not \nprovide evidence that he contacted the police or filed a police report. AG \u00b6 20(e) does \nnot apply. He has not provided sufficient mitigating evidence. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I have also considered \nApplicant\u2019s honorable military service, his positive character evidence, good job \nperformance, and the number of years he has held a security clearance without \nadditional security concerns. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his Answer, Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.j with no further explanations. His admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and evidence submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is 70 years old, married and has two adult children. He grew up in India and served in the United Kingdom Merchant Navy from about 1973 through 1982. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in the United States in 1983 and became a United States citizen in 1991. He started with his current employer as a port engineer in January 2021 and has since been promoted to a managerial position.

After a thorough and careful \nreview of the pleadings and evidence submitted, I make the following additional findings \nof fact. \nApplicant is 70 years old, married and has two adult children. He grew up in India \nand served in the United Kingdom Merchant Navy from about 1973 through 1982. He \nearned a bachelor\u2019s degree in the United States in 1983 and became a United States \ncitizen in 1991. He started with his current employer as a port engineer in January 2021 \nand has since been promoted to a managerial position. (GX 1-2; Tr. 23) \nIn his March 2021 SCA, Applicant disclosed about $415,000 in delinquent federal \nincome tax debt for tax years (TY) 2015, 2016, 2018 and 2019. He also disclosed being \ndelinquent for the deficiency balance on a mortgage after he sold the property in \nNovember 2020 for less than the mortgage value of about $1,460,000. (GX 1) \nIn his April 2021 interview with a security clearance background investigator, \nApplicant estimated that his federal income tax debt had increased to $500,000 for TYs \n2015, 2016, 2018 and 2019. He also disclosed $73,500 in State income tax debt for \nTYs 2016 through 2019 as well as about $25,000 in delinquent property taxes. He \nfurther clarified that he owed about $185,000 for the deficiency balance on the \nmortgage. (GX 2) \nApplicant explained that from about 1990 through 2009, he worked in the United \nStates for a large shipbuilder that was based overseas. In about 2004-2005, he became \nthe CEO of a newly formed subsidiary of that company in the United States. His salary \nas CEO was $346,000 plus annual bonuses of up to $120,000. He described this work \nas lucrative, but very stressful. During this time, he also purchased a minority share in \ntwo local hotels and earned an annual dividend of up to $200,000. (GX 1-2; Tr. 19-24, \n35-37). \nIn 2008, Applicant borrowed substantial funds to build a nearly $2,000,000 \n\u201cdream home\u201d (Home B).

Later that year, the housing market collapsed, and Home B became \nworth substantially less than the purchase price. (GX 1-2; Tr. 25-30) \nDespite the uncertain economic times, Applicant resigned from his job in 2009, \nbelieving he could earn a comparable salary as a consultant. However, the economic \nslowdown scaled back work in his field and he struggled to maintain a consistent \nincome. He also stopped receiving dividends from his hotel investment. (GX 1-2; \nTr. 25-27) \nFrom 2010 through early 2014, Applicant\u2019s intermittent consulting work earned \nhim about $100,000 annually. However, it was not enough to maintain his financial \ncommitments. During this period, he depleted his savings and sold his wife\u2019s jewelry. He \nalso tried to sell Home B, but the property was worth less than what he owed on the \nmortgage and he was unable to get the lender to agree to a short sale. (GX 1-2; \nTr. 27-30) \nApplicant made several early withdrawals from his 401k retirement account in \norder to pay his mortgage and bills. He filed his tax returns on time with the assistance \nof an accountant, but failed to pay all taxes or the penalties due for his 401K \nwithdrawals. Applicant began accruing delinquent tax debt in 2011 and was assessed \nunderpayment penalties from 2011 through 2014 that he was unable to address at the \ntime. (GX 1-2; Tr. 21-27) \nFrom late 2014 through early 2019, Applicant worked as a consultant for his \nformer employer, the shipbuilder. He primarily worked overseas and earned \napproximately $200,000 annually. With this income, Applicant paid much of his \ndelinquent tax debt for TYs 2011 through 2014. (GX 1-2; Tr. 21-22, 30) \nHowever, while resolving one tax problem, Applicant created another. Because \nhe was a consultant, and not a company employee, his former employer did not \nwithhold income taxes from his pay. Although Applicant continued to timely file his tax \nreturns from 2015 through 2019, he repeatedly failed to fully pay taxes when due. \n(GX 1-2; Tr. 22, 30-32) \nIn early 2019, Applicant\u2019s consultancy work for his former employer ended and \nhe once again struggled to secure new work. He stopped making any payments on his \ndelinquent taxes at that time. In 2020, his financial difficulties were further exacerbated \nwhen business slowed because of closures related to the COVID-19 pandemic. \n(GX 1-2; Tr. 22-25, 35-38) \nIn November 2020, Applicant sold Home B at a loss and moved back into his \npreviously rented Home A. Since starting with his current employer in January 2021, he \nhas maintained a steady income and currently earns $139,000 annually. Additionally, \nsince he is now a W-2 employee, a substantial portion of his annual tax obligations are \nwithheld by his employer.

Applicant admitted \neach allegation and the delinquent taxes are reflected in an April 2021 IRS account \nsummary. The evidence provided does not show comprehensive detail of Applicant\u2019s \ntax account activities for TYs 2015 through 2019. However, it does reflect a number of \npayments that he made to the IRS. In 2016, he paid about $40,000 that was applied \ntoward tax debts for TYs 2012 and 2013. In 2017, he paid about $78,000 that was \napplied toward tax debts for TYs 2012 and 2016, as well as an estimated payment for \nTY 2017. In 2018, he paid about $202,000 that was applied toward tax debts for TYs \n2012, 2014 and 2017, as well as an estimated payment for TY 2018. In 2019, he paid \nabout $36,000 that was applied toward tax debts for TYs 2012 and 2013. (GX 1-3; \nAX C) \nFrom January through March 2020, Applicant made monthly payments of $580 \ntoward his federal tax debt, payments that were applied toward TY 2015. He stopped \nmaking payments in March 2020 because the COVID-19 pandemic and economic \nslowdown affected his ability to pay. He made no payments until July 2021. From then \nthrough January 2022, he made monthly payments of $520 that were also applied \ntoward TY 2015. In February 2022, he made a $20,176 payment for TY 2020. In \nDecember 2022, he made a $22,000 payment for TY 2021. However, from January \n2023 through the hearing in June 2023, he did not issue any payments to the IRS \nbeyond his employer\u2019s W-2 withholdings. (GX 2-3; AX C; Tr. 32-34) \nAt hearing, Applicant explained that he still owed about $10,000 for TY 2021 that \nrelated to income from his hotel investment. In total, Applicant estimated he currently \nowes about $450,000 in delinquent federal taxes. He hired a tax attorney in September \n2022 to assist in communicating with the IRS and setting up a payment plan for all of his \ndelinquent tax years. However, as of the hearing, no payment plan had been \nestablished. Instead, he was considering communicating with the IRS directly. In his \npost-hearing statement, he explained that he now had monthly disposable income of \nabout $2,000 and reiterated his intent to approach the IRS in the near future and \nestablish a payment plan. (AX A; Tr. 23, 34-35, 65-70) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e-1.h: delinquent State taxes for TY 2016 ($20,385), TY 2017 \n($21,685), TY 2018 ($22,045), and TY 2019 ($9,352). Applicant admitted each \nallegation and State tax account records reflect that he entered into a payment plan in \nMay 2019, but defaulted on that plan in October 2019. Thereafter, the debt transferred \nto a collection agency. In June 2021, he initiated monthly payments of $200 through the \ncollection agency. (GX 2, 4; Tr. 40-41) \nAn April 2022 statement from the collection agency showed that Applicant owed \nthe State about $88,160 for TYs 2016 through 2019.

(GX 1-2, 6-8; AX F; Tr. 43) \nOutside of the accounts alleged in the SOR, Applicant has no additional \ndelinquent debts. He submitted a budget reflecting that, after paying his obligations, he \nmaintains a net remainder of about $2,300 per month. Although he listed State and \nproperty taxes in this budget, he did not include a payment for his delinquent federal tax \nobligations. (GX 7-8; AX B) \nApplicant described himself as an upstanding, loyal and proud citizen. He stated \nhe maintained a strong work ethic and would continue to strive toward overcoming the \nfinancial hardships he experienced and resolving his tax issues. (AX A; Tr. 75-76) \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard \nindicates that security determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \n484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988) \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \n\u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on \nmere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \nThe financial security concern is broader than the possibility that an individual \nmight knowingly compromise classified information to raise money.

An individual who is financially irresponsible may also \nbe irresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \nThe adjudicative guideline notes three conditions that could raise security \nconcerns under AG \u00b6 19 and are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence reflect that he failed to pay federal and \nState income taxes due, that his property taxes are delinquent and that he is past-due \nfor the deficiency balance on a mortgage account. All of the above disqualifying \nconditions apply. \nThere are five pertinent conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties:  \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSince 2008, Applicant has experienced challenging financial circumstances that \nwere both beyond and within his control. He was directly impacted by the housing \nmarket crash in 2008 and the subsequent difficult economic conditions. Over a decade \nlater, he was further impacted by the COVID-19 shutdowns. Some consideration is also \ngiven to his inconsistent income resulting from his consulting work. However, Applicant \nchose to leave a lucrative position in 2009 in the midst of difficult economic conditions. \nFrom 2011 through 2014, he also chose to repeatedly withdraw 401k funds, but not pay \nthe accompanying taxes and penalties when due. While he is credited with later paying \nthese taxes, he did so by not fully paying his tax obligations for TY 2015 through 2019. \nSince he timely filed his tax returns each year, he was fully aware of his tax obligations, \nyet allowed the problem to escalate. Now, with penalties and interest, he owes about \n$450,000 in delinquent federal taxes. \nIn 2020 and 2021, Applicant twice attempted and failed to maintain a payment \nplan with the IRS. He hired a tax attorney in September 2022 to assist in communicating \nwith the IRS and made his last tax payment in December 2022 that was specifically for \nTY 2021. Yet, at hearing, no payment plan had been established and he presented no \ntimeline for the resolution of his federal tax debt. Instead, his tax problem expanded, as \nhe also now owes an additional $10,000 for TY 2021. While Applicant\u2019s tax debt for \nTY 2021 is not alleged in the SOR, it shows further unresolved tax delinquencies and \nundercuts assertions of mitigation since his tax problems are ongoing. \nAfter the hearing, Applicant submitted a budget that reflected a net remainder of \nover $2,000 per month. He affirmed his intent to communicate with the IRS and to use \nthese funds to begin another payment plan. However, outside of his W-2 tax \nwithholdings, he did not show the issuance of any federal tax payments since \nDecember 2022. \nNone of the AG \u00b6 20 mitigating conditions is fully applicable to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.d. \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent federal taxes are long-standing, ongoing, and cast doubt on his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. He has not provided sufficient \nevidence that he acted responsibly under the circumstances or initiated and adhered to \na good-faith effort to repay this debt. He has not offered a clear timeline for resolution \nand he has not established that the problem is under control. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b), 20(d) and 20(g) are applicable to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e - 1.h. The root causes \nof Applicant\u2019s State tax issues are similar to those of his federal tax issues. However, he \nhas demonstrated more commitment to repaying his State tax debt. He made payments \nunder a payment plan with the State from May to October 2019. In June 2021, he \nestablished a monthly payment plan of $200 with a collection agency on behalf of the \nState. In May 2022, payments increased to $250 per month. He has budgeted for and \nmaintained payments under this plan for over two years. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), and 20(d) are applicable to SOR \u00b6 1.i. Applicant failed to fully \npay his property taxes on Home A from 2017 through 2021. This occurred at a time \nwhen he primarily worked overseas and was also trying to sell Home B.

A \nJune 2023 account statement from the locality confirmed that the delinquent taxes were \npaid. Although he still owes a small amount of additional taxes for 2023, he has acted \nresponsibly and resolved this SOR debt. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b) and 20(d) are applicable to SOR \u00b6 1.j. Applicant purchased \nHome B when he was experiencing better financial circumstances. As his financial \ndifficulties increased, he endeavored to maintain the mortgage until he eventually sold \nHome B in 2020 for a substantial loss and less than the mortgage amount. He then \nmaintained regular communication with the lender and reached a settlement in January \n2021. He has since budgeted for and maintained monthly payments on this debt. He \nhas taken responsible action under the circumstances \nAfter experiencing variable periods of financial difficulties, Applicant has made \nsignificant progress in resolving several of his delinquent debts. However, those efforts \ndo not fully mitigate the ongoing financial security concerns arising from his federal tax \nissues. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant initially experienced financial difficulties from 2008 through 2014 \nbecause of the 2008 financial crisis and his struggles to maintain consistent work as a \nconsultant. He took several early withdrawals from his 401k retirement account, but \nthen failed to pay the associated taxes, penalties and interest when required.

However, he also continually \nfailed to pay income taxes when due. He traded one tax problem for another. \nApplicant then experienced further financial difficulties with the loss of his \nconsulting work in 2019 and the economic difficulties that occurred with the Covid-19 \npandemic in 2020. Since starting with his current employer, he has maintained a \nconsistent income and has resolved or is resolving several of his outstanding debts. I \nfound his desire to address his financial concerns sincere. However, his statements and \nactions, to date, are insufficient to establish good-faith, responsible efforts to resolve his \nsubstantial federal tax debt. The record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts \nas to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nnot mitigated the security concerns raised by his significant ongoing federal tax debt. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.e-1.j: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant a security clearance.

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on April 16, 2019. On April 1, \n2022, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) sent her a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline F. The CAF \nacted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by the and the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated in Security Executive Agent Directive 4, National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines (December 10, 2016). \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on April 22, 2022, and requested a decision on the \nwritten record without a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written \ncase on September 27, 2022. The Government\u2019s submission included amendments to \n\n \n2 \n \nthe SOR. On October 18, 2022, a complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) \nwas sent to Applicant, who was given an opportunity to file objections and submit material \nto refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government\u2019s evidence. She received the FORM on \nOctober 26, 2022. The record does not reflect a response to the FORM. Department \nCounsel submitted a revised submission on December 16, 2022, deleting the \namendments to the SOR. The record does not reflect when the revised submission was \nreceived by Applicant, but she responded on January 17, 2023. Her response consisted \nof a three-page cover letter and six pages of a credit report dated January 17, 2023. I \nmarked her response as Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AX) A, and admitted it in evidence without \nobjection. The case was assigned to me on February 23, 2023.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, she admitted all the allegations except SOR \u00b6 \n1.f. Her admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 60-year-old human-resource manager employed by a defense \ncontractor since March 2017. She married in August 1983, divorced in March 1993, and \nmarried in May 2005. She has two adult children and two adult stepchildren. She received \na bachelor\u2019s degree in May 1986 and a master\u2019s degree in May 2008. She has been \nemployed steadily since about February 2015. She received a security clearance in \nNovember 2019. (GX 5) \n \n \nThe SOR alleges a Chapter 13 bankruptcy (SOR \u00b6 1.a), a failure to timely file a \nfederal income tax return for 2017 and pay the taxes due (SOR \u00b6 1.b), and six delinquent \ndebts totaling about $10,000 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c-1.h). The bankruptcy filing is reflected in court \nrecords (FORM Item 7), and the delinquent debts are reflected in credit reports from June \n2021 and May 2020. (FORM Items 8 and 9) \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s SCA, she disclosed that she engaged a tax preparer to prepare and \nfile her federal income tax 2017 tax return, but the tax preparer failed to file it. Applicant \nstated that she was unaware that the return had not been filed until she received a letter \nfrom the IRS. She stated that the return was filed in February 2019, and that she was \nmaking monthly payments on the tax debt. (FORM Item 3 at 41) When she was \ninterviewed by a security investigator in August 2021, she stated that the debt had been \nsatisfied through a payment plan and diversion of tax refunds. (FORM Item 4 at 10) In \nresponse to DOHA interrogatories on January 10, 2022, she submitted IRS tax transcripts \nreflecting that all tax returns for 2017 through 2020 had been filed, an installment \nagreement was established in April 2019, six payments were made in May through \nNovember 2019, and her tax debt was satisfied. (FORM Item 4 at 17-23) \n \nApplicant filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition in December 2019. The delinquent \ndebts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c-1.h were included in the bankruptcy. Her case was dismissed \nin August 2020 for failure to make payments on the bankruptcy plan. (FORM Item 7) \nWhen she was interviewed by a security investigator in August 2021, she stated that she \nexpected that the bankruptcy plan would require payments of about $876. However, when \n\n \n3 \n \nthe plan was finalized, it required payments of $1,523. She told the investigator that, after \nmaking two or three payments, she found that she had insufficient income for her living \nexpenses. After she missed two payments, she decided to negotiate directly with her \ncreditors. (FORM Item 4 at 9) \n \n \nWhen Applicant was interviewed by the security investigator, she had not \ncontacted any of the creditors alleged in the SOR. (FORM Item 4 at 10-11) She told the \ninvestigator that she delayed contacting her creditors after the bankruptcy was dismissed, \nbecause she waited to see if they would contact her. She knew that she could not afford \nto pay all her creditors at the same time. (GX 4 at 12) She attributed her financial problems \nto overextending herself to help her children pay their bills. (GX 4 at 9) \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s response to the January 2022 interrogatories, she submitted \nevidence that she had resolved three debts not alleged in the SOR. (FORM Item 4 at 24-\n26) In April 2022, after she received the SOR, she paid the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, \n1.g, and 1.h. In May 2022, she settled the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e. In June 2022, she \nsettled the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d and paid the debt alleged in \u00b6 1.f. (FORM Item 2 at \n4-12; FORM Response at 4-9)  \n \n \nDuring the security interview, Applicant disclosed that she had traveled on cruises \nin 2014 with her husband, in 2015 with friends, in 2017 with her husband, and 2019 with \nher husband. (GX 4 at 8) She also disclosed to the investigator that she traded in an older \nluxury car for a newer two-year-old luxury car after her older car began to have \nmechanical problems. The trade-in value of her old car was sufficient to pay off the loan \non that car. Her monthly car payments on the newer car are $735. (GX 4 at 9) \n \nIn her response to the FORM, she asserted that her foreign travel did not contribute \nto her financial problems. (FORM Response at 2) She and her husband keep their \nincomes separate, and they have agreed which one will pay joint expenses such as \nhousing, vehicles, and vehicle maintenance. Her husband paid for all the cruises except \none. \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \n\n \n4 \n \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016).   \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, the evidence in the FORM, and Applicant\u2019s response to \nthe FORM establish the following disqualifying conditions under this guideline: \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; \n \nAG \u00b6 19(b): unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \nAG \u00b6 19(f): failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax as required. \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially relevant:  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n\n \n6 \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts were numerous, recent, \nand were not incurred under circumstances making recurrence unlikely. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not established. The failure of Applicant\u2019s tax preparer to file the \n2017 tax returns was a condition largely beyond her control, but she did not act \nresponsibly. She allowed two years to pass without monitoring her tax preparer or \notherwise ensuring that the tax returns were filed, and she did not react until she was \ncontacted by the IRS.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is established. Applicant would have been required by the bankruptcy \ncourt to receive financial counseling. Even though Applicant failed to comply with the \nbankruptcy plan, her financial situation is now under control. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is established for the tax debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b. Applicant started \nresolving the past-due income tax returns and tax debt before she submitted her SCA. \nBy the time she was interviewed by a security investigator in August 2021, she had \nresolved the past-due returns and the tax debt.  \n \n \nHowever, this mitigating condition is not established for the other debts alleged in \nthe SOR. She did not take any action to resolve these debts until she received the SOR. \nEvidence of past irresponsibility is not mitigated by payment of debts only under pressure \nof qualifying for a security clearance. Applicants who begin to address their security-\nsignificant conduct only when their personal interests are at stake may be lacking in \njudgment and reliability. ISCR Case No. 16-01211 (App. Bd. May 30, 2018). A security \nclearance adjudication is an evaluation of an individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. It is not a debt-collection procedure. ISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. \nJun. 21, 2010.) Even if an applicant has paid his or her debts, an administrative judge \nmay still consider the circumstances underlying the debts for what they may reveal about \nthe applicant\u2019s eligibility for a clearance. ISCR Case No. 14-02394 (App. Bd. Aug. 17, \n2015.) \n \nAG \u00b6 20(g) is established. Applicant has filed the past-due federal income tax \nreturn and paid the amount due. While Applicant should have been more diligent in \n\n \n7 \n \nmonitoring the performance of her tax preparer, she resolved the tax issue shortly after \nshe was notified by the IRS and before she received the SOR.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Because Applicant requested a \ndetermination on the record without a hearing, I had no opportunity to evaluate her \ncredibility and sincerity based on demeanor. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. \nBd. Jul. 23, 2003). After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under \nGuideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by her delinquent debts. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.c-1.h: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the\nUnited States to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nClearance is denied. \n \n \n \n \n \nLeRoy F.

This allegation \nis found for Applicant. \n2.c. ~ 2.d. All of Applicant siblings were born in either Russia or the Republic of \nGeorgia. They immigrated to the United States as children, with their parents in 1991. \nAll are now U.S. citizens, except for the eldest brother who is a dual national with \nRussia. All of Applicant\u2019s siblings, to include his eldest brother, live in the United States. \nThe eldest brother is a handyman who \u201cfixes trailers and sells them.\u201d (TR at page 32 \nline 8~10, at page 36 line 18 to page 37 line 7, at page 45 lines 7~14, and at page 37 \nline 17 to page 39 line 9.) These allegations are found for Applicant. \nAdministrative Notice \nAs Applicant no longer has a Filipina fianc\u00e9, I only take administrative notice of \nthe following facts about Russia: It is a highly centralized authoritarian political system \ndominated by its president. Russia has violated Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty and territorial \nintegrity in 2014 and again in 2022. Russia is a serious threat to our national security. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative \njudge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \nnational security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall \nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \nAnalysis \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations \nApplicant has significant past-due indebtedness. \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 including: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts \nAlthough Applicant attributes much of his financial problems to his divorce, they \nare ongoing. He is only addressing one of his numerous, admitted past-due debts. \nApplicant has not demonstrated that future financial problems are unlikely. Mitigation \nunder AG \u00b6 20 has not been established. Financial Considerations is found against \nApplicant. \nGuideline B - Foreign Influence \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in \nAG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. Three are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; and \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \nApplicant had a Pilipino fianc\u00e9, and family members born outside of the United \nStates. The evidence is sufficient to raise these disqualifying conditions. \nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered all \nof the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 including: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAll of Applicant\u2019s family members are residents of the United States. All of his \nsiblings, except for his eldest brother, are only citizens of the United States. The eldest \nbrother is a dual national, who is self-employed, and has lived in the United States since \n1991. Mitigation under AG \u00b6 8 has been established. Foreign Influence is found for \nApplicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines F and B in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with \nquestions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nFor all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the Financial \nConsiderations security concerns. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a~1.m: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.n. and 1.o: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline B: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a~2.f: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

He has been \nemployed in a cleared position as an engineer with his current employer or its \npredecessor since July 2013.

They separated in 2014 and \ndivorced in August 2018. He remarried in September 2018. He has three adult children, \nand an adult stepson. (Item 2) \nThe SOR alleges several years of unfiled state and Federal income tax returns, \nabout $100,000 in past-due Federal income taxes, and several charged off consumer \ndebts, totaling about $37,000. Applicant admitted all the allegations in the SOR and \noffered no explanation or subsequent evidence.

In his July 2020 background \ninterview, and then later in interrogatory responses, he acknowledged additional unfiled \nstate and Federal returns, now encompassing TY 2014-2020. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i, 1.n) \nIn April 2021, Applicant hired a tax relief service (Service). By contract, the Service \nwas to provide him with recommendations regarding his tax compliance. Applicant did not \nprovide any additional evidence detailing what services were ultimately provided. (Item 3) \nIRS account transcripts dated March 2022 reflect that the IRS prepared substitute \ntax returns for TY 2014-2018.

(Item 4) \nApplicant admitted that he failed to file his state tax returns for tax years 2014-\n2020. (SOR \u00b6 1.n) He provided no evidence to show that those returns have since been \nfiled or what his outstanding state tax liability is, if any.

He later disclosed that he thought it was a way to be vindictive \ntowards his first wife. (Item 4) \nThe remainder of Applicant\u2019s debts in the SOR involve charged-off accounts with \nprivate creditors, mostly banks. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a ($11,225), 1.b ($7,390), 1.c ($5,797), 1.d \n($4,793) and 1.f ($3,358) are credit-card accounts and loans with a credit union.

(Items 3-7) \nSOR \u00b6 1.e ($3,408) is a charged-off credit-card account. During his interview, \nApplicant stated his belief that the account was paid off. However, there is no evidence \nin the record of a payment. The debt is unresolved. (Items 3-6) \nSOR \u00b6 1.g ($1,271) is a charged-off credit-card account. During his interview, \nApplicant was unsure whether he owed any amount on this account. The debt is reflected \nin Applicant\u2019s credit reports and it is unresolved. (Items 3-6) \nSOR \u00b6 1.h ($440) is a charged-off credit-card account. During his interview, \nApplicant stated his belief that the account was paid off. However, there is no evidence \nin the record of a payment. The debt is unresolved. (Items 3-6) \nDuring his interview, Applicant explained that most of his financial struggles were \nthe result of his separation and divorce. During this period, he experienced financial strain \nwhile attempting to pay for rent, a mortgage, alimony, child support and legal fees. He \nstated he was now able to keep up with his finances and was taking steps to repay his \ndebts. Applicant said he intends on keeping up with all of his debts going forward. \n(Items 4, 6) \nApplicant has an annual salary of $100,000 in addition to military retirement and \ndisability benefits. He estimates that he maintains a monthly net remainder of $2,780. \nApplicant also contributes to a 401k retirement plan with an estimated balance of \n$40,000-$50,000.

As the \nSupreme Court held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nThe adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nThe financial security concern is broader than the possibility that an individual \nmight knowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money. It \nencompasses concerns about an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities \nessential to protecting classified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible \nmay also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding \nclassified information. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nIn ISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016) (emphasis added), the \nDOHA appeal board detailed the concern about applicants who fail to file their tax returns \nas follows: \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established governmental rules and systems. Voluntary \ncompliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting \n[sensitive] information. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, \n2002). As we have noted in the past, a [trustworthiness] adjudication is not \ndirected at collecting debts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No, 07-08049 at 5 (App. \nBd. Jul. 22, 2008). By the same token, neither is it directed towards inducing \nan applicant to file tax returns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating \nan applicant\u2019s judgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails repeatedly to \nfulfill his or her legal obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of \ngood judgment and reliability required of those granted access to [sensitive] \ninformation. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2015); See Cafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, \n284 F.2d 173, 183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). \nApplicant failed to timely file his Federal income tax returns for six years, 2014-\n2018 and 2020. The IRS filed substitute returns for many of these years and calculated\nthat he owes $106,154 in past-due Federal income taxes. Applicant also failed to file his\nstate tax returns for 2014-2020. Applicant\u2019s charged-off consumer debts in the SOR are\nestablished by the credit reports in the record and his admissions. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c),\nand 19(f) all apply.\n \n \n \n \n \nAccordingly, the burden shifts to Applicant to mitigate the security concerns raised \nby the above financial considerations. The adjudicative guideline includes five conditions \nin AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security concerns arising from Applicant\u2019s financial \ndifficulties: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;\n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n6 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s extensive past-due Federal tax debts and consumer debts remain \nongoing and unresolved. He has not established that his tax issues or debts are due to \ncircumstances that are unlikely to recur or no longer cast doubt on his judgment, \ntrustworthiness, and reliability. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \nApplicant experienced significant financial stress in relation to his marital \nseparation and divorce. AG \u00b6 20(b) therefore has some application. However, Applicant \nchose to stop timely filing and paying his tax obligations in 2015 and he continued to not \ntimely file or pay his tax obligations after the divorce. While these circumstances may \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhave contributed to Applicant\u2019s financial delinquencies, they do not mitigate or extenuate \nhis failure to fulfill his legal obligations to timely file his state and Federal income tax \nreturns and pay taxes when due. Applicant has not established a track record of steady \npayments on either his past-due taxes or other delinquent debts to warrant full mitigation \nunder AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) or 20(d). \nApplicant hired a tax relief service in April 2021 to assist him with his tax issues. \nHowever, he subsequently failed to file his 2020 tax return and did not provide sufficient \nevidence to establish that his past-due taxes or other delinquent debts are being resolved \nand are under control. AG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply. \nApplicant failed to timely file his 2014-2018 and 2020 Federal income tax returns \non time as required. He failed to timely file his 2014-2020 state income tax returns on time \nas required. Instead, the IRS filed substitute returns for 2014-2018. The tax return for \n2020 remains unfiled. Except for TY 2019, Applicant has made essentially no effort to file \nhis state and Federal tax returns in a timely, responsible manner. Applicant has over \n$100,000 in past-due Federal tax debt and has not established an installment agreement \nwith the IRS, let alone established compliance with such an arrangement. AG \u00b6 20(g) \ndoes not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-\nperson analysis. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case.

However, what started as a \nvindictive act of financial sabotage during a period of separation with his first wife turned \ninto a long and ongoing record of tax problems. His tax issues are entirely self-created, \nbut might have been resolvable with some due diligence after his divorce. Applicant\u2019s \ndemonstrated pattern of unwillingness to comply with his legal obligations raises serious \nsecurity concerns. Additionally, he has numerous old and unresolved past-due debts and \nhas yet to implement a reasonable plan to address them. Overall, the record evidence \nleaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance. I conclude that Applicant did not provide sufficient evidence to mitigate \nthe financial security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.n: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.

In his answer, Applicant admits each of the allegations under this \nguideline. \nApplicant was unemployed from August to October 2020. He had various odd \njobs between 2013 and 2020. He has no prior security clearances. \nIn April 2009, Applicant was cited by Fort Rucker Military Police for possession of \nmarijuana in the second degree. There are no further details concerning this citation. \nIn about March 2017, while employed for a city as a government worker, \nApplicant was terminated from his employment for testing positive for marijuana. In \nFebruary 2017, he consumed a brownie containing marijuana with a friend. \n(Government Exhibit 4.) He stated that he took a random drug test two weeks later and \ntested positive for marijuana. Applicant\u2019s employment records reveal that Applicant was \nterminated for violating the drug policy which prohibits the use of illegal drugs. He was \nalso most likely under the influence of marijuana while on the job, as he was observed \ndriving a John Deer gator into traffic, and was observed having slurred speech and not \nbeing able to balance or stand.

This was a false answer. Applicant failed to \ndisclose that he was fired from his employment for testing positive for marijuana. \nApplicant\u2019s employee records from the city confirm this fact.  (Government Exhibit 5.) \nDuring an interview with an authorized investigator working for the U.S. \nDepartment of Defense on January 4, 2021, Applicant was asked if he had used any \nillegal drugs. He initially unequivocally denied any drug involvement. Applicant stated \nthat he has never used illegal drugs in his life; never been involved in illegal drugs; and \ndoes not associate with those that do use illegal drugs. (Government Exhibit 4, at \npg.13.) Only after he was confronted by the investigator about the information revealed \nduring his investigation involving drug use, did Applicant admit that he had used \nmarijuana in 2017. \nDuring that same interview with the investigator on January 4, 2021, Applicant \nwas asked about his involvement with possession of marijuana at Fort Rucker in April \n2009. Only when confronted, Applicant stated that he was questioned about a jacket \nthat was found to have marijuana paraphernalia. He stated that when questioned about \nit by the military police, he denied that the jacket was his and that he was released \nwithout being charged, when in fact, Applicant was cited for possession of marijuana. \nDuring another interview with the investigator on January 13, 2021, Applicant \nwas questioned about his termination from his employment in March 2017. Applicant \nstated that he \u201cleft for a better job,\u201d when in fact he was terminated for failing a drug \ntest. (Government Exhibit 4, at pg. 14.) Applicant stated that he ate a marijuana \nbrownie about two weeks before being given a random drug test and that he was not \nimpaired when he returned to work. This was obviously false. Applicant was tested for \ndrug abuse because he displayed abnormal or erratic behavior consistent with drugs or \nalcohol while at work. Applicant\u2019s employment records indicate that his supervisor \nobserved abnormal and erratic behavior associated with drug use. The physical signs \nand symptoms noted were slurred speech, unsteady gait, dilated pupils, blood shot or \nwatery eyes, and the odor of marijuana. (Government Exhibit 5.) \nApplicant deliberately falsified his security clearance application dated November \n11, 2020; and provided false information to the investigator during personal interviews \non January 4, 2021; and January 13, 2021, in an effort to conceal his illegal drug use \nand the adverse impact it has had on his work history. It was only when he was \nconfronted with adverse information from the investigator did he provide truthful \nanswers to the Government. \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant incurred delinquent debt totaling in excess of \napproximately $25,650. He admits the three delinquent debts with some explanation. \nApplicant\u2019s credit report dated September 28, 2022, confirms these debts. \n(Government Exhibits 6.) \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n           \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n          \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe following debts are of security concern: \n1.a.

The debt remains \nowing. \n1.b. Applicant is indebted to a creditor for an account that was charged off in the \napproximate amount of $1,978. \nThere is no evidence of a payment history or \ndocumentation showing that he has taken steps to resolve the debt.

There is no evidence of a payment \nhistory or documentation showing that he has taken steps to resolve the debt. The debt \nremains owing. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for the personal conduct guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, \ninvestigator, security official, competent medical or mental health \nprofessional involved in making a recommendation relevant to a national \nsecurity \neligibility \ndetermination, \nor \nother \nofficial \ngovernment \nrepresentative; and \n5 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n(c) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicting that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nThis includes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations. \nOn a number of occasions, Applicant deliberately lied to the Government in \nresponse to questions about his illegal drug involvement, and the impact it has had on \nhis work history both on his security clearance application dated November 11, 2020, \nand during his interviews with the DoD investigator on January 4, 2021, and January 13, \n2021. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I have \nconsidered each of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 below: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a \nperson with professional responsibilities for advising or instructing the \nindividual specifically concerning security processes. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activities was unwitting, \nhas ceased, or occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon \nthe individual's reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations. \nNone of the mitigating conditions are applicable. \nApplicant lied to the \nGovernment about his illegal drug involvement and the impact it has had on his work \nhistory on his security clearance application dated November 11, 2020, and during his \ninterviews on January 4, 2021, and January 13, 2021. \nApplicant\u2019s duty and \nresponsibility is to ensure that the information he provided to the Government is \naccurate and truthful to the best of his ability. Applicant was clearly dishonest. There is \nno excuse for his dishonesty that calls his character into question. \nApplicant\u2019s \ndeliberate falsifications and continuing disingenuous answers preclude a finding of good \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. To be entrusted with the privilege of holding a \nsecurity clearance, one is expected to be honest and truthful at all times, and to know \nand understand the rules and regulations that apply to them, and to always abide by \nthose rules. \nUnder the particular facts of this case, Applicant falls short of this \nrequirement and has not demonstrated this awareness. By failing to provide truthful \nanswers on the security clearance application, and during his personal interviews, he \nhas shown that he cannot be trusted. Applicant does not meet the qualifications for \naccess to classified information. Accordingly, the personal conduct security concern \nhas not been mitigated.  This guideline is found against Applicant. \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. One is potentially applicable in this case: \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nApplicant has incurred debt that he has been unable to pay. The evidence is \nsufficient to raise the above disqualifying condition. \nThe following mitigating conditions under Financial Considerations are potentially \napplicable under AG \u00b6 20: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g. loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nApplicant remains excessively indebted. \nHis credit report confirms this \nindebtedness. He has not made a good-faith effort to resolve his debts. In fact, he has \nsubmitted nothing in mitigation. \nAccordingly, the financial consideration security \nconcern has not been mitigated. This guideline is found against Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Applicant has not been honest, candid \nor truthful on his security clearance application and during interviews with the DoD \ninvestigators regarding his illegal drug involvement. \nHe also remains delinquently \nindebted in the amount in excess of $25,000. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I conclude Applicant has not \nmitigated the Personal Conduct and Financial Considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.g.  \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a. through 2.c.  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information \nis denied. \nDarlene Lokey Anderson \nAdministrative Judge \n9 \n",
