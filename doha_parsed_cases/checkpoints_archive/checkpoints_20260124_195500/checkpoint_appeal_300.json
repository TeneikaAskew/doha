Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro se\n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On May\n6, 2019, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing. \nOn February 24, 2020, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Paul J. Mason denied Applicant\u2019s\nrequest for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal:  whether the Judge erred in his findings and\nconclusions and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. \nConsistent with the following, we affirm.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact\nApplicant, who is in his 40s, is employed in a position supporting a Federal agency.  He has\nearned a bachelor\u2019s degree, served on active duty in the military, and received an honorable\ndischarge.  He is married with a minor child.  He has held a security clearance since the mid-90s. \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant had two delinquent credit card accounts totaling about\n$29,000.  He admitted both allegations with explanations.  Unemployment contributed to his\nfinancial problems.  He experienced periods of unemployment when temporary jobs ended.  One of\nhis jobs ended by mutual agreement after he received notice of unsatisfactory performance.  In\nanother job, he was asked to do work that he did not know how to do and that employment ended\nwith his unanticipated release.  \nApplicant had intended for the statute of limitations to run on both debts so that they would\nbecome uncollectible but changed his mind when he received the SOR.  In his SOR Response, he\nnoted that he received financial advice from both his facility security officer (FSO) and a financial\nadvisor, and he negotiated settlements for each debt.  This was the first time that he documents\ncontacting the creditors since he learned of the delinquent status of the debts in 2014.  He began\nmaking regular payments on them in 2019, and both debts are scheduled to be paid in May 2020. \nHe does not utilize a written budget but rather keep track of his finances mentally.  \nApplicant owes the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for delinquent taxes that are not alleged\nin the SOR.  Part of this indebtedness was the result of Applicant not reporting taxable income as\na 1099 employee in 2013 and 2014.  The other part is the result of Applicant making an erroneous\nnotation on his 2018 W-2 Form indicating he was exempt from Federal taxes for the year.  The\ncombined total of his Federal tax debt is about $19,000.  He indicated that he has been making\nregular payments on the earlier tax indebtedness since 2014 but only provided documentation\nshowing payments to the IRS since October 2018.  In May 2019, his monthly IRS payments\nincreased from $300 to $500 to account for the 2018 delinquency.   His state tax delinquency for\n2013 and 2014 has been resolved though periodic payments.  The Judge indicated that he would\naddress the IRS tax issues in his whole-person analysis.      \n2\n\nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis\nApplicant has a history of not meeting his financial obligations.   He took no documented\naction to resolve the two delinquent credit card debts until after he received the SOR.   He\nexperienced periods of unemployment that were beyond his control but did not document responsible\naction under the circumstances.  During the period in question, he took three vacations outside the\nUnited States.   \u201cThe only financial counseling Applicant received was in May 2019, when the FSO\nmade recommendations about how to negotiate and settle debts.  Applicant provided no information\non the advice the financial adviser provided to repair his credit.\u201d  Decision at 7.  He merits only\npartial credit for making good-faith efforts to resolve the debts because he initially planned to let\nthem become uncollectible through the running of the statute of limitations.  \nDiscussion\nIn his appeal brief, Applicant makes arguments based on assertions that are not contained in\nthe record.  Such assertions constitute new evidence.  The Appeal Board is prohibited from\nconsidering new evidence on appeal.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.\nApplicant challenges some of the Judge\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions.  We examine\nchallenged findings to see if they are supported by substantial evidence, i.e., \u201csuch relevant evidence\nas a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary\nevidence in the same record.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 16-04094 at 2 (App.\nBd. Apr. 20, 2018).  From our review of the record, the Judge\u2019s material findings and conclusions\nof a security concern are based on substantial evidence or constitute reasonable inferences that could\nbe drawn from the evidence.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-02225 at 2-3(App. Bd. Jun. 25, 2019). \nApplicant argues, for example, the Judge\u2019s erred in concluding he failed to present credible\nevidence of financial counseling by pointing to statements in his SOR Response that reflect he\nreceived such counseling.  We note the Judge made findings that Applicant consulted with a\nfinancial advisor.  In his SOR Response, Applicant noted a financial advisor instructed him about\ndownloading his credit report, reviewing it, and contacting the creditor of the two debts to negotiate\nrepayment.  Additionally, he mentioned talking to another financial advisor who focused on how to\nnegotiate with the creditor but also made suggestions on how to repair his credit after the debts were\nresolved.  The Judge apparently was not convinced this evidence was sufficient to merit full credit\nunder Adjudicative Guideline (AG) \u00b6 20(c)  \u2013 \u201cthe individual has received or is receiving financial\ncounseling for the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit\ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under\ncontrol.\u201d  Directive, Encl 2, App. A \u00b6 20(c).  The Judge concluded, \u201cApplicant receives negligible\nmitigation under AG \u00b6 20(c).\u201d  Decision at 7.  We cannot say this conclusion was erroneous.  In\ngeneral, Applicant has failed to identify any error that would likely have an impact on the outcome\nof the case.    See, e.g., ISCR Case No 11-15184 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 25, 2013) (an error is harmless\nif it did not likely affect the outcome of the case).  \n3\n\nApplicant further states, \u201cThe Administrative Judge and Department Counsel attempted to\nbring forth issues with the Applicant\u2019s history with Federal Taxes but the Applicant made immediate\narrangements with the IRS after each tax year filing, and had no issues with those debts in a way that\nthey should not be looked upon unfavorably towards the Applicants [sic] security standing.\u201d  Appeal\nBrief at 2.  To the extent that Applicant is challenging the Judge\u2019s consideration of his non-alleged\ntax issues, we do not find that contention persuasive.  It is well established that a Judge may consider\nunfavorable non-alleged matters for certain limited purposes, such as (a) in assessing an applicant\u2019s\ncredibility; (b) in evaluating an applicant\u2019s evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed\ncircumstances; (c) in considering whether the applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation;\nand (d) in applying the whole-person concept.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-07369 at 3 (App. Bd.\nAug. 16, 2017).   We find no error in the Judge\u2019s consideration of Applicant\u2019s tax issues in his\nwhole-person assessment.   \nThe balance of Applicant\u2019s arguments amount to a disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing\nof the evidence.  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence or an ability\nto argue for a different interpretation of the evidence is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\nweighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary\nto law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 18-02581 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 14, 2020). \nApplicant has failed to establish the Judge committed any harmful errors.  The Judge\nexamined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision.  The\ndecision is sustainable on this record.  \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted only\nwhen \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d  Department of the Navy v.\nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).

Department Counsel requested a hearing.  On March 31, 2020, after the hearing,\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Elizabeth M. Matchinski\ndenied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6\nE3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge erred in her findings of fact\nand whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  The Judge\u2019s\nfavorable findings on four Guideline F allegations and one Guideline E allegation were not raised\nas an issue on appeal.  Consistent with the following, we affirm.\nThe Judge found against Applicant on three delinquent debts totaling about $20,800.  The\nlargest of those debts (over $19,500) was incurred when Applicant prematurely terminated an\napartment lease.  The smaller debts involved accounts from a telecommunication company\n(approximately $770) and a cable company (approximately $450).  The Judge also found against\nApplicant on an allegation asserting he received nonjudicial punishment in 2006 for fraud, forgery,\nmaking a false statement, impersonation, and unauthorized wearing of a military uniform.\nIn his appeal brief, Applicant challenges the Judge\u2019s unfavorable finding on the nonjudicial\npunishment allegation and denies having engaged in any fraudulent activity.   He asserts:\n[The Judge] also improperly applied the mitigating factors to [Applicant\u2019s] personal\nconduct allegation, whereas [Applicant] stated at his hearing that he told his Battalion\nCommander, that he was guilty of wrongfully driving a vehicle in Korea and that he\nwrongfully wore a rank earlier than he should.  At the non-judicial Article 15 hearing,\n[Applicant] was advised to plead guilty to obtain a better sentence.  [Applicant]\nlacked life experiences during the time of his misconduct fourteen (14) years ago, and\n[Applicant] did not fully appreciate the adjudication process.  [Applicant] provided\nsupporting letters of recommendation at the hearing, and he has shown no recidivism\nwithin the last fourteen (14) years, which [the Judge] made no mention of in her\ndecision.  Therefore, the Administrative Judge failed to consider all aspects of\n[Applicant\u2019s] Whole Person Concept and other mitigating factors, making the\ndecision in this case erroneous. [Appeal Brief at 6, omitting a footnote.]     \nIn her Analysis, the Judge addressed the nonjudicial punishment allegation by stating:\n. . . . Applicant\u2019s misconduct in 2006 while serving on active duty triggers\nconsideration of mitigating conditions under AG [Adjudicative Guideline] \u00b6 17.  AG \n\u00b6 17(c) applies because of the passage of almost 14 years since the misconduct.  AG\n\u00b6 17(c) provides:\n2\n\n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the\nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on\nthe individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\nYet, despite the passage of so much time, Applicant has not shown that he\nfully accepts responsibility for that behavior.  He denies any fraudulent activity, even\nthough the Commander\u2019s report of disciplinary action (GE 7) indicates he pled\n\u201cguilty\u201d to all five of the offenses, including forgery, fraud, and making a false\nstatement.  Instead of showing the reform that could have triggered AG \u00b6 17(d) (\u201cthe \nindividual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to change the\nbehavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or\nfactors that contributed to untrustworthy, unreliable, [or] other inappropriate\nbehavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur\u201d), Applicant would have the\nGovernment believe that it involved only driving a private vehicle, which he needed\nfor warfighter training, and that his unauthorized wearing of sergeant rank was only\n\u201cpartially wrong\u201d because his LES [Leave and Earnings Statement] reflected his rank\nas E-5.  His current lack of full candor about his misconduct in 2006 causes lingering\ndoubt about his personal conduct.  For the reasons noted, the personal conduct\nconcerns are not fully mitigated.  [Decision at 17.]\nBased on our review of the record, we conclude that GE 7 supports the Judge\u2019s conclusion that\nApplicant pled guilty at the nonjudicial punishment proceeding to five offenses, including forgery,\nfraud, and making a false statement.  To the extent that Applicant is contending that the Judge made\nno mention of the letters of recommendation he submitted at the hearing, this contention is not\naccurate.  The Judge made findings regarding Applicant\u2019s character reference letters.  See Decision\nat 4.  Applicant has failed to show the Judge erred in making any findings of fact or in reaching any\nconclusions regarding the nonjudicial punishment allegation. \nRegarding the cable company debt for about $450, Applicant asserts that a $400 payoff\nconfirmation in Exhibit E shows that he paid this debt to the successor company of the alleged\ncreditor.  We are unable to locate in Exhibit E the $400 payoff confirmation that Applicant is\nreferencing.  Applicant testified that he disputed this debt and received documentation that the\naccount was closed.   A document from a collection agency in Exhibit E reflects \u201cyour account [from\na different cable company] has been closed by this office and returned to your creditor\u201d and \u201cShould\nyou wish to confirm the deletion, we recommend checking back with the bureaus in approximately\nthirty (30) days.\u201d  At the hearing, a discussion between the Judge and the parties ensued about\nwhether the documents in Exhibit E addressed the alleged cable company debt or an unalleged debt. \nTr. at 67-74.  This discussion ended with the Judge saying she would \u201cmake findings based on the\nevidence I have in the record.\u201d  Id. at 74.  In her decision, the Judge concluded that Applicant\nprovided no proof the alleged cable company debt was resolved, noting that he failed to show the\ndebt referenced in Exhibit E is the alleged debt.  Applicant has failed to show the Judge erred in \nreaching that conclusion.        \n3\n\nApplicant also contends the Judge did not consider or properly weigh all the relevant\nevidence.  For example, he argues the Judge did not give appropriate weight to various\ncircumstances beyond his control\u2014such as his loss of employment, divorce, and advice from a\ndivorce attorney to not make payments on any debts until a marital settlement agreement was\nreached\u2014and she did not properly consider his efforts in working with debt collection companies\nto reach settlement agreements.  He further asserts that he has accepted responsibility for his actions\nthat resulted in him receiving nonjudicial punishment and, the absence of any further wrongdoing,\nshows he has learned from his past mistakes.  These arguments, however, are neither enough to rebut\nthe presumption that the Judge considered all of the record evidence nor sufficient to show that the\nJudge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 15-01717 at 4 (App. Bd. Jul. 3, 2017).  We give due consideration to the Hearing\nOffice cases that Applicant has cited, but they are neither binding precedent on the Appeal Board nor\nsufficient to undermine the Judge\u2019s decision.  Id.  We further conclude the Judge considered the\ntotality of the evidence, in compliance with the whole-person analysis requirements.  See Directive,\nEncl. 2 App. A \u00b6 2(a) and (d). \nThe Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the\ndecision.

In 2014, anticipating that Applicant\u2019s wife\nwould soon be laid off from her job, the couple sold one of their two houses.  In mid-2015,\nApplicant\u2019s wife was indeed laid off.  The couple sought and received a loan modification for their\nhouse and have not missed payments since then.\nHowever, Applicant has not paid off his delinquent credit card debt, which amounts to a little\nover $39,000.  The cards became delinquent in mid-2016.  Applicant hired a debt resolution\ncompany to assist in paying off his obligations.  However, the company he hired was sued by the\nFederal Trade Commission for deceptive practices\u2013apparently, the company was not forwarding\npayments to creditors.  The company\u2019s assets were placed in receivership, and Applicant had not\nreceived any return of his payments as of the close of the record.\nIn mid-2018, Applicant\u2019s wife was approved for disability benefits.  She received a lump-\nsum payment of about $45,000 and began receiving monthly payments of about $1,600 soon\nthereafter.  Applicant and his wife currently have about $41,000 in savings and usually have a\nminimum of about $500 left over each month.  Applicant entered into a settlement agreement with\none of the creditors but did not provide evidence of any payments.  He did not make contact with his\nother creditors because he believed that he could not make payments toward resolving the debts.\nDespite attempting to reduce expenses, Applicant and his wife spent about $7,200 for four\ntrips to the Carribean between 2015 and 2019.  During the time that they were using cash advances\nfrom their credit cards to make mortgage payments, they also leased luxury vehicles.  He has started\nworking with a law firm to address his debts but did not provide evidence that any payments or\npayment plans had been completed.\nApplicant has received numerous awards for \u201cexemplary work performance.\u201d  Decision at\n4.  He received favorable performance reviews for 2013 through 2018.  \n2\n\nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis\nThe Judge cited to evidence that Applicant\u2019s financial problems pre-dated his wife\u2019s layoff,\ninsofar as he had already been drawing on his credit card accounts to make mortgage payments. \nAlthough he and his wife have about $41,000 in savings, they have been unwilling to use these funds\nto pay down debts.  The Judge concluded that Applicant had behaved reasonably by seeking and\nreceiving a loan modification and by making payments to a debt resolution company.  However, he\nfound that Applicant had provided no evidence of debt payment since mid-2017.  \nIn the whole-person analysis, the Judge noted Applicant\u2019s having held a clearance for many\nyears without incident or concern.  He also cited to Applicant\u2019s excellent work record.  However,\nhe concluded that Applicant\u2019s inaction regarding his delinquent debts raised concerns about his\njudgment that his evidence has failed to resolve.\nDiscussion\nApplicant contends that the Judge erred in finding that he and his wife had a joint savings\naccount.  At the hearing, Applicant asked his wife, whom he had called as a witness, \u201chow much we\nhave in our savings account at this point,\u201d to which she replied, \u201cIn our savings account right now,\naround $41,000 I believe.\u201d  Tr. at 104.  The challenged finding constitutes a reasonable inference\nfrom the evidence.  Even if there were some error here, it did not likely affect the overall outcome\nof the case.  Therefore, any such error was harmless.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 18-02581 at 3 (App.\nBd. Jan. 14, 2020).   The Judge\u2019s material findings are based upon substantial evidence.\nApplicant notes the disqualifying conditions that the Judge applied and cites to evidence that\nhe believes demonstrates that these conditions have not been satisfied.  We construe his argument\nto mean that the Judge erred in concluding that his circumstances raised security concerns.  The\nJudge\u2019s findings about Applicant\u2019s ongoing, significant delinquent debt support his conclusion that\nApplicant\u2019s circumstances raise security concerns.  Debts that have remained unpaid over a course\nof years can properly be characterized as a history of delinquent debt.  See Directive, Encl. 2, App.\nA \u00b6 19(c).  See also ISCR Case No. 17-03146 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 31, 2018).  Moreover, the Directive\npresumes a nexus or connection between admitted or proved circumstances under any of the\nGuidelines and an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a clearance.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 18-02581 at 4. \nApplicant has not rebutted the presumption of nexus in this case.    \nApplicant cites to various pieces of evidence that he believes supports his case for mitigation. \nApplicant\u2019s arguments are not enough to rebut the presumption that the Judge considered all of the\nevidence in the record, nor are they sufficient to show that the Judge weighed the evidence in a\nmanner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 18-02872 at 3\n(App. Bd. Jan. 15, 2020).    \nThe record supports a conclusion that the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated\na satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found\nand the choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

A supervisor and coworkers submitted reference letters vouching for his honesty,\ntrustworthiness, and integrity. \n2\n\nThe Judge\u2019s Pertinent Analysis\nMitigating Condition 20(g), i.e., the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate\ntax authority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those arrangements, was\nestablished, but that does not end the inquiry.  \u201c[Applicant] did not abandon his three-year rule until\nhe was interviewed by a security investigator in July 2018 and realized that his security clearance\nwas in jeopardy.  His belated action in an effort to protect his security clearance \u2018does not reflect the\nvoluntary compliance of rules and regulations expected of someone entrusted with the nations\nsecrets.\u2019\u201d  Decision at 6, quoting from ISCR Case No. 14-05794 at 7 (App. Bd. Jul. 7, 2016).\n\u201c[Applicant] admitted that his failure to timely file his returns was due to procrastination and a\nlackadaisical attitude about his tax obligations.  He may be a conscientious employee and a careful \nmanager of his personal finances, but he has offered no excuse other than procrastination for failing\nto carry out his basic duty as a citizen to timely file his tax returns.\u201d  Id.    \nDiscussion\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant challenges a number of the Judge\u2019s findings of fact.  We examine a Judge\u2019s\nchallenged findings to determine if they are supported by substantial evidence, that is, \u201csuch relevant\nevidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the\ncontrary evidence in the same record.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-02145\nat 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 10, 2018).  None of Applicant\u2019s challenges to the Judge\u2019s findings merit relief. \nWe note that some of his challenges to the findings essentially amount to disagreements with the\nJudge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, which is discussed separately below. \n \nApplicant challenges, for example, the Judge\u2019s finding that Applicant was \u201clackadaisical\u201d\nin meeting his tax filing obligations.  He argues that his admission to being lackadaisical was taken\nout of context.  During his opening statement, Applicant stated, \u201cThe primary point that I hope to\ndemonstrate in his hearing is that my past, admittedly lackadaisical attitude toward my tax filing\nobligations, in no way reflect on my ability, trustworthiness, and reliability to protect classified\ninformation.\u201d  Tr. at 16-17.  He contends the Judge only restated his admission about being\nlackadaisical without explaining the mitigating context in which it was offered.  He also indicated\nthat he made a similar statement during his closing argument and cites to the Chief Judge\u2019s\nPreheaing Guidance for DOHA Industrial Security Clearance (ISCR) Hearings and Trustworthiness\n(ADP) Hearings for the proposition that an opening statement is not evidence.  We do not find these\narguments persuasive.  The Judge\u2019s finding at issue is not misleading, but rather is a reasonable\nreiteration or interpretation of the record evidence.  In his SOR Response, Applicant referenced his\n\u201cpast lackadaisical attitude toward timely tax filing\u201d and described his conduct as \u201cprocrastination.\u201d \nSOR Response at 2 and 6.  During cross-examination, he further acknowledged his statement to an\ninvestigator that his tax filing delinquencies were due to procrastination was as accurate summary\nof the interview.  Tr. at 53.  See also Government Exhibit 2, Applicant\u2019s response to interrogatories\n3\n\nthat includes his background interview.  The Judge\u2019s finding that Applicant was lackadaisical in\nfiling his tax returns is supported by substantial evidence.  \n Applicant also challenges the Judge\u2019s finding that he never requested an additional extension\nbeyond the automatic six-month extension.  He argues this finding was an unfair characterization\nof his statements because it erroneously implies he had the option to request another extension that\nhe neglected to execute. We do not find this finding misleading.  In this regard, it merits noting that\na Judge's decision is not measured against a standard of perfection, and there is no requirement that\na Judge discuss each and every piece of evidence in his or her decision.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No.\n12-01500 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 25, 2015).  Within the parameters that a Judge must base his or her\nfindings of fact on substantial evidence, comply with the requirements of Executive Order 10865 and\nthe Directive, and draw conclusions that are not arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law, he or she\nhas broad latitude and discretion in how to write a decision.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.  In this case, the\nJudge\u2019s decision as written is sustainable.  \nApplicant further challenges the Judge\u2019s finding that he has two children living at home when\nhe testified he and his wife live alone and challenges the finding that his wife receives a pension. \nApplicant acknowledges that these errors have no direct bearing on the case.  We agree.  These errors\nare harmless because they do not likely affect the outcome of the case.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 11-\n15184 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 25, 2013).  Applicant also asserts these errors are indicative of a trend.  He\nargues, for example, the former error \u201ccreates concern regarding the thoroughness and familiarity\nof [the Judge\u2019s] review of the record, and an ensuing concern that other evidence in the record was\nnot fairly reviewed and considered prior to arriving at the unfavorable decision.\u201d  Appeal Brief at\n1.  We do not find this argument persuasive.  Applicant\u2019s arguments in his appeal brief fail to rebut\nthe presumption that the Judge considered all the evidence in the record.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No.\n19-00520 at 2 (App. Bd. Feb. 7, 2020).  Notably, Applicant admitted the significant facts pertaining\nto his tax filing deficiencies in his SOR Response and his testimony.  From our review of the record,\nthe Judge\u2019s material findings or conclusions of a security concern are supported by substantial\nevidence or constitute reasonable inferences that could be drawn from the evidence.  See, e.g., ISCR\nCase No. 18-02581 at 3 (Jan. 14, 2020).  \nNexus\nApplicant claims there is no nexus between his tax filing deficiencies and how he performs\nhis security clearance responsibilities.  The Directive, however, presumes there is a nexus or rational\nconnection between proven circumstances under any of its guidelines and an applicant\u2019s security\neligibility.  Direct or objective evidence of nexus is not required.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-00520\nat 2.  Moreover, Guideline F recognizes that applicants who do not act responsibly in the handing\nof their finances, such as filing tax returns when due, may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or\nnegligent in handling and safeguarding classified information.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 16-04112\nat 3-4 (App. Bd. May 28, 2019).  This assignment of error lacks merit. \nWeighing of the Evidence\n4\n\nApplicant makes various arguments challenging the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence.  In\ndoing so, he asserts the Judge did not properly consider key evidence.  For example, he argues that\nhe is not a security risk, that his tax filing deficiencies were an anomaly based on a lack of\nunderstanding of the security clearance implications, that the Judge erred in finding that he did not\nconsider the impact of his tax filing deficiencies until he underwent a background interview, and that\nthe Judge\u2019s findings and conclusions understate the mitigating evidence, including his character\nreferences.  Such arguments do not demonstrate harmful error.  The presence of some mitigating\nevidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.  As the\ntrier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable\nevidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  A party\u2019s disagreement with the\nJudge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence,\nis not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner\nthat is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-08684 at 2 (App. Bd.\nNov. 22, 2017).  We find no error in the Judge\u2019s analysis of the mitigating evidence or in his whole-\nperson assessment. \nBias\nApplicant contends the \u201cnumerous instances of factual error, unfair and unfavorable\nmischaracterizations, and errors with regard to consideration of the mitigating conditions as well as\nof the whole person assessment, which in whole lead to an unfair, partial, unfounded conclusion\nregarding my trustworthiness to hold a security clearance.\u201d  Appeal Brief at 1.  He also contends that\nJudge\u2019s \u201cerror of omission in considering very favorable evidence continues a trend raising a concern\nfor the fairness and impartiality of the decision.\u201d  Id. at 5.  We do not find these arguments\npersuasive.  There is a rebuttable presumption that a Judge is impartial and unbiased, and a party\nseeking to overcome that presumption has a heavy burden of persuasion.  See, e. g., ISCR Case No.\n15-03162 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 25, 2017).  Applicant has failed to identify any errors or evidence,\neither individually or cumulatively, that would persuade a reasonable, disinterested person to\nquestion the fairness and impartiality of the Judge.  This issue is resolved adversely to Applicant.\n  \nConclusion\n Applicant\u2019s appeal brief fails to establish the Judge committed any harmful error.  The Judge\nexamined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision.  The\ndecision is sustainable on this record. A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal\nobligations, such as complying with tax return filing requirements, does not demonstrate the high\ndegree of good judgment and reliability required of those granted access to classified information. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-08782 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 5, 2017).  \u201cThe general standard is that a\nclearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d \nDepartment of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).

Consistent with the following, we remand.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis\nApplicant\u2019s SOR alleges six delinquent student loans, eight delinquent consumer accounts,\nand a medical bill that has been placed in collection.  The student loans became delinquent in 2017\nand the others between late 2012 and late 2018.  In addition to those listed in the SOR, Applicant\nalso has about 20 more student loans that have gone into collection and three vehicle loans.  The\nJudge stated that he would consider the non-alleged debts on the issue of mitigation.  Applicant\nattributed her financial problems to a $20,000 reduction in pay in 2015.  She presented evidence that\nshe had resolved some of her debts.  She also submitted a student loan rehabilitation agreement,\nthough she provided no documentary evidence that she had made payments under it.  She provided\nno evidence of monthly income or expenses or whether she had received financial counseling.  \nThe Judge noted that many of Applicant\u2019s SOR debts became delinquent prior to her\nreduction in pay.

Applicant\nrequested a decision on the written record.  On January 6, 2020, after considering the record, Defense\nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Gina L. Marine denied Applicant\u2019s\nrequest for a trustworthiness designation.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and\nE3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether he was denied due process and\nwhether the Judge\u2019s decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the\nfollowing, we affirm.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis\nApplicant is married and has four minor children.  The SOR alleges that he has four\ndelinquent student loans totaling about $54,000 and a delinquent credit card debt of about $780.  In\nhis response to the SOR, he admitted the four student loan debts but denied the credit card debt.  In\nhis response to Department Counsel\u2019s File of Relevant Material (FORM), he acknowledged the\ncredit card debt remained delinquent, noted he set up a repayment plan for it in which he would\nmake monthly payments of $25, but failed to provide proof of those payments.  His FORM response\nalso indicated that he made numerous attempts to resolve his student loan debts but struggled making\npayments due to providing for a family of six.\nIn her analysis, the Judge stated:\nApplicant has substantial delinquent debts that remain unresolved, including \nfederal student loans, despite being steadily employed full time since April 2010.  He \nfailed to establish that his financial situation resulted from circumstances beyond his\ncontrol or that he acted responsibly to address his delinquent debts.  He did not\nprovide proof that he made any of the alleged payments towards his debts.  He is\ncredited with negotiating a payment plan to resolve the credit-card debt alleged in\nSOR \u00b6 1.e.  However, he did not demonstrate that he initiated good-faith efforts to\nrepay or otherwise resolve his student-loan debts.  Thus, in light of the record before\nme, I cannot conclude that Applicant has mitigated the Guideline F concerns at this\ntime. [Decision at 5.]\nDiscussion\nIn his appeal brief, Applicant submitted matters from outside the record.  In general, we\ncannot consider new evidence on appeal.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.  However, we have previously\nconsidered new evidence insofar as it bears upon the questions of due process and jurisdiction.  See,\ne.g., ADP Case No. 14-05412 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 15, 2015).\n2\n\nApplicant essentially asserts that he was denied due process because he was not granted\nadequate time to submit documentary evidence in response to the FORM.  The record reflects that\nApplicant was sent a copy of the FORM on both September 17, 2019, and October 16, 2019, and was\nadvised to make any objections and to submit any additional matters for the Judge\u2019s consideration\nwithin 30 days of receipt of that document.  In his appeal brief, he states that the FORM was not\ngiven to him until December 19, 2019, and provides a signed receipt reflecting he received it on that\ndate.  The record, however, contains a receipt that Applicant signed reflecting he received the FORM\non October 28, 2019.  The record also contains Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM:  an undated letter\nin which he submitted seven documents.  One of those documents, the repayment plan for the credit\ncard debt, is dated October, 29, 2019.  His FORM response does not contain a request that he be\ngranted additional time in order to submit more matters.  On December 2, 2019, Department Counsel\nindicated that she had no objection to the matters Applicant submitted in his FORM response.  In\nher Decision, the Judge noted that Applicant timely responded to the FORM and admitted into\nevidence the documents he submitted as Applicant Exhibits A through G.\n  \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.7 provides that an applicant shall have 30 days from receipt of the FORM\nin which to submit a documentary response.  A review of the entire record discloses no basis to\nconclude that Applicant was denied the rights afforded him under the Directive or that he was not\nprovided an adequate opportunity to respond to the FORM.  We resolve Applicant\u2019s denial of due\nprocess assertion adversely to him.\nApplicant\u2019s remaining arguments amount to a disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the\nevidence.  These arguments are largely based on new evidence that, as noted above, we cannot\nconsider.  He  argues that, prior to his current financial problems, he actively addressed his debts and\nlived within his means.  He contends that his alleged debts do not cast doubt on his current reliability\nand good judgment because they occurred so long ago and under circumstances that are unlikely to\nrecur.  Overall, his arguments are not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence in\na manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ADP Case No. 19-02087 at 3\n(App. Bd. Feb. 12, 2020).\n    \nThe Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the\ndecision.  The decision is sustainable on this record.  The standard applicable to trustworthiness\ncases is that set forth in Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) regarding\nsecurity clearances: such a determination \u201c. . . may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the\ninterests of the national security.\u2019\u201d  See, e.g., ADP Case No. 19-02087 at 3.

He was given a good prognosis and was advised not\nto drink and drive in the future.  He decided to abstain permanently from alcohol consumption and\nmaintained that commitment for over three years.  \nIn early 2018, he consumed alcohol at a party and then went to a bar with friends.  He was\nstopped by the police while driving home.  He was convicted of reckless driving and breathalyser\nrefusal, and his driver\u2019s licence was suspended for three years.  Knowing that the reckless driving\nconviction could lead to his employment termination, he agreed to resign from his position to keep\nhis employment record clean.  \nApplicant has abstained from alcohol consumption since his 2018 incident.  He and his wife\nno longer have alcohol in their house.  He has received extensive counseling and does not believe\nhis has an alcohol problem.  He \u201cmaintains that he has never driven a vehicle under the influence of\nalcohol[.]\u201d  Decision at 3.  He signed a letter of intent not to return to drinking.  A counselor has\nassessed him as not being in need of treatment.\n2\n\nApplicant has been arrested four times for alcohol-related offenses within eight years. \nAlthough the first incident resulted in a dismissal of the charge, the other incidents resulted in him\nparticipating in alternative disposition programs and being convicted of refusing a breathalyser.  His\ndriver\u2019s license remains suspended.  The security concerns arising from his arrests are partially\nmitigated due to the passage of time.  His previous attempt at abstinence lasted about three years. \nIt is too early to conclude that he has established a clear pattern of abstinence or that his alcohol\nproblems are unlikely to recur.  More time is needed for him to establish current reliability and good\njudgment. \n \nDiscussion\nIn his appeal brief, Applicant does not challenge any of the Judge\u2019s specific findings of fact.\nRather, he contends the Judge failed to adhere to Executive Order 10865 and the Directive by not\nconsidering all of the evidence and the Judge failed to properly apply the mitigating conditions and\nwhole-person concept.  In making those arguments, he assets that the Judge did not give proper\nweight to certain evidence, including his signed statement of intent to abstain from alcohol, his\nvoluntary wearing of a device that monitors alcohol consumption, his participation in alcohol\ncounseling, and the amount of time that has elapsed since he last consumed alcohol.  He also\nchallenges the Judge\u2019s conclusion that more time is required for him to demonstrate reform and\nrehabilitation.  His arguments, however, are neither sufficient to rebut the presumption that the Judge\nconsidered all of the evidence in the record nor enough to show that the Judge weighed the evidence\nin a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-02488\nat 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 30, 2018). \n \nWe gave due consideration to the Hearing Office cases that Applicant has cited in support\nof his arguments, but they are neither binding precedent on the Appeal Board nor sufficient to\nundermine the Judge\u2019s decision.  Id. at 3-4.  The cited cases are easily distinguishable from the\npresent case.  Moreover, the Appeal Board recently reversed one of the three Hearing Office cases\nthat Applicant cited in support of his arguments.  See ISCR Case No. 19-00381 (App. Bd. Aug. 10,\n2020).  We further conclude the Judge considered the totality of the evidence in compliance with the\nwhole-person analysis requirements.  See Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and 2(d). \nApplicant has failed to establish that the Judge committed any harmful error.  The Judge\nexamined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nCheryle Bernard-Shaw, Esq.\n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On May\n31, 2019, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing. \nOn February 26, 2020, after the hearing, Administrative Judge John Bayard Glendon denied\nApplicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28\nand E3.1.30. \nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge was biased against her,\nwhether the Judge erred in his findings of fact, and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following discussion, we affirm the\nJudge\u2019s decision.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact\nApplicant, who is in her 60s, has worked for a Government contractor for about 17 years and\nhas held a security clearance for about 12 years.  She has earned a master\u2019s degree.  She is divorced\nwith no children.  \nIn her SOR Response, Applicant admitted she had not filed her Federal and state income tax\nreturns for 2012 through 2017.  At the time of hearing, these tax returns remained unfiled.  She also\nhad not filed her 2018 Federal and state tax returns, which was not alleged in the SOR and would\nonly be considered in applying the mitigating conditions.  She attributed some of her tax filing\ndeficiencies to Internal Revenue Service (IRS) audits of her 2010 and 2011 Federal tax returns.  The\naudits were concluded in 2016 and disallowed some of Applicant\u2019s tax deductions for those years. \nApplicant claimed she paid the taxes for 2010, but an exhibit reflected she had an outstanding\nbalance of about $2000 that was \u201ccurrently not collectable.\u201d  Decision at 3.  She admitted she owed\nabout $16,000 for 2011 and claimed she was paying that debt, but an exhibit reflected the last\npayment was in April 2016.  In early 2019, her 2011 Federal tax debt was listed as uncollectible. \nApplicant provided other explanations for delays in filing her tax returns, including problems with\na mortgage lender seeking to foreclosure on her house, mold in her house, roof leaks, and flooding\nin her garage.  She lived at other locations while contractors repaired recurring mold problems.     \n  \nA week or two before the hearing, Applicant hired a tax advisor who testified the delinquent\ntax returns would be filed in early February 2020.  The tax advisor indicated the IRS told her the\nFederal tax returns for 2012 and 2013 did not need to be filed.  Home contractors were helping\nApplicant in removing boxes of financial records from her home so that they could be provided to\nher tax advisor.   After the hearing, Applicant did not provide proof that the delinquent Federal tax\nreturns were filed or explain the lack of such evidence.  She did provide the first pages of state tax\nreturns for 2014 through 2017, which do not show that they were filed or whether she owes any state\ntaxes for those years.  Neither Applicant nor her tax advisor made any representation that these\n2\n\nreturns have been filed.  Moreover, she did not provide an explanation for the missing state tax\nreturns for 2012 and 2013.  She did provide a document from the state tax authorities that her state\ntaxes for 2014 through 2018 were paid.    \nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis\nApplicant\u2019s admission, her testimony, and the documentary evidence establish a history of\nnot meeting her financial obligations and a failure to file her Federal and state tax returns as required. \nHer excuses for failing to file her tax returns as required were not sufficient to persuade the Judge\nthat they were the actual causes for those deficiencies.  She receives some credit for hiring a tax\nprofessional days before the hearing.  Her actions continue to cast doubt on her reliability,\ntrustworthiness, and good judgment.  \nDiscussion\nApplicant asserts the Judge was biased against her.  She raises two issues regarding bias. \nFirst, she contends the Judge demonstrated bias when he admonished her twice to \u201cTell the truth\u201d\nand \u201cdid not admonish anyone else to tell the truth to the same degree that he admonished the\nApplicant.\u201d  Appeal Brief at 3.  In this regard, she also argues, \u201cBias in courtrooms and various\njudicial settings is a serious problem that affects the ability of African Americans to receive a fair\nresult in a courtroom/hearing room setting.\u201d  Id.  It merits noting the first admonition she cites is the\nstandard advisement given to all applicants and witnesses pursuant to Directive \u00b6 E3.1.18, and the\nonly other witness to testify at the hearing was her tax advisor.  The second cited admonition\noccurred when Applicant was about to commence her testimony, and repeating the warning at that\nstage of the proceeding is also customary.  In any event, there is no evidence to support the\nsuggestion that race was a consideration in this case.  Second, Applicant contends the Judge\u2019s\nassistance to Department Counsel at the hearing, while offering Applicant no assistance, shows an\nappearance of bias.  This latter assertion involved the Judge asking Department Counsel at the\nhearing whether she wished to amend SOR \u00b6 1.c to conform to the evidence.  SOR \u00b6 1.c alleged:\nc.  The Internal Revenue Service selected your federal income tax returns for tax\nyears 2010 and 2011 for audit.  As of the date of this Statement of Reasons, the taxes\nfor these years remain unresolved.\nAs a result of the Judge\u2019s question, Department Counsel made a motion to delete the second sentence\nof that allegation.  In his decision, the Judge indicated that he granted her motion.  This amendment\nto the SOR inured to Applicant\u2019s benefit because it removed any tax indebtedness from\nconsideration in applying the disqualifying conditions.  Although the Judge was authorized under\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.17 to amend that SOR allegation on his own motion to conform to the evidence of\nApplicant\u2019s currently uncollectible taxes for 2010 and 2011, he did not do so and eventually\nconcluded that Disqualifying Condition 19(a) \u2013 inability to satisfy debt \u2013 did not apply \u201cbecause\n3\n\nthere is no SOR allegation that Applicant had a tax debt or that she was unable to satisfy it.\u201d \nDecision at 6.  Based on the circumstances presented in this case, Applicant has failed to show the\nJudge committed any error by merely asking if Department Counsel intended to amend the SOR to\nconform to the evidence. \n    \nThere is a rebuttable presumption that a Judge is impartial and unbiased, and a party seeking\nto overcome that presumption has a heavy burden of persuasion.  See, e. g., ISCR Case No. 18-02722\nat 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 30, 2020).  Bias is not demonstrated merely because the Judge made adverse\nfindings or reached unfavorable conclusions.  Id.  Our review of the record reveals nothing that\nwould persuade a reasonable person that the Judge lacked the requisite impartiality.  Id.  Applicant\nhas failed to meet her heavy burden of persuasion on this issue.  \n \nApplicant raises the issue of ineffective assistance of counsel.  She argues that her hearing\ncounsel did not meet with her in advance of the proceeding and failed to prepare her to testify.  She\nalso states her hearing counsel did not make appropriate objections to questions that could have been\ndamaging to her case.  She believes her hearing counsel\u2019s actions compromised her ability to receive\na fair hearing.  However, the ineffective assistance of counsel doctrine is not applicable in a DOHA\nproceeding.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-07941 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2018).  None of her\narguments are sufficient to establish either that she was denied any due process rights under the\nDirective or that she was denied a fair hearing. \nApplicant claims the Judge erred in finding she did not provide proof of filing her Federal\nand state tax returns for 2012 through 2017.  She asserts that she provided receipts showing such\nfilings in her post-hearing submission.  Based on our review of Applicant\u2019s post-hearing submission,\nwe conclude the Judge\u2019s finding that Applicant provided no proof of filing her Federal tax returns\nfor 2012 through 2017 is sustainable.   Applicant also appears to argue the state tax authorities\nadvised her that she was no longer required to file tax returns for 2012 and 2013; however, that claim\nconstitutes new evidence that we cannot consider.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.  In her post-hearing\nsubmission, she provided the first pages of her state tax returns for 2014 through 2017, which were\nstamped \u201cSD FEB 07 2020 REC\u2019D.\u201d   Who or what entity received these state tax returns is not clear\nfrom the stamps, but the stamps could possibly reflect receipt by an office of the state taxing\nauthority.  While the Judge may have erred in failing to address the significance of those stamps, this\nwas a harmless error because it did not likely affect the outcome of the case.  See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo 11-15184 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 25, 2013).  Applicant\u2019s Federal tax filing deficiencies, standing\nalone, are a sufficient basis for denying her security clearance eligibility.  Also, Applicant appeals\nthe \u201csynopsis\u201d at the beginning of the Judge\u2019s decision for not citing evidence she presented in her\npost-hearing submission.  The paragraph in question is merely a summary or digest of the opinion\nas a whole.  Even if it were error for the synopsis to have omitted citation to specific evidence, the\nBoard has held such error is normally harmless.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No.  06-23384 at 2 (App. Bd.\nNov. 23, 2007).\nApplicant also disagrees with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence.  For example, she\ncontends that the Judge failed to address adequately her extenuating circumstances and failed to\napply the whole-person factors.  Her arguments are not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed\n4\n\nthe evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No.\n15-08684 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 22, 2017). \nApplicant has failed to establish the Judge committed any harmful errors.  The Judge\nexamined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro se\n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On June\n7, 2019, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a decision\non the written record.  On December 30, 2019, after considering the record, Defense Office of\nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Robert Robinson Gales denied Applicant\u2019s\nrequest for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following discussion, we affirm the\nJudge\u2019s decision.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis\nApplicant, who is in her 60s, is an employee of a defense contractor. She has earned a\nmaster\u2019s degree.  She is divorced with children.  She was granted a security clearance in the 1990s. \nWith the exception of occupying a two-month temporary position, she was unemployed for over a\nyear in 2013-2014.  Her unemployment was impacted by a Government sequestration and shutdown. \nShe \u201cattributed her financial problems to being a single mother; living in a one-income household;\nher period of unemployment, her father\u2019s illness and death . . . ; her son\u2019s college needs, and her\ndaughter was almost ready to attend college.\u201d  Decision at 3.\n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant has 20 delinquent debts totaling about $50,000.  Applicant\nasserted that she either paid, is paying, or will soon start paying the delinquent debts.  In her SOR\nResponse, Applicant provided a spreadsheet that appeared to reflect numerous financial transactions\nbetween June 2016 and February 2018.  She claimed that she engaged a company to assist her in\nresolving the debts but that relationship ended in February 2017. The Judge indicated that the\n\u201cspreadsheet is essentially useless.\u201d  Decision at 5.  He noted that, without any comments or\nexplanations from Applicant, it is nearly impossible to determine if any of the alleged accounts were\nresolved or were being resolved.  Applicant also disputed, failed to address, or provided no\ninformation regarding some debts.  In general, her contentions about the debts were not corroborated\nby documentary evidence.  A Government exhibit, however, reflected that three of the alleged\naccounts were resolved.  A senior management official at her company praised Applicant\u2019s work\nethic and expertise. This official and others also lauded her character and judgment.   \nApplicant incurred delinquent debts \u201cand essentially ignored them until July 2015.\u201d  Decision\nat 9.  The efforts that she and a debt resolution company took to settle the debts between July 2015\nand February 2017 are unclear.  Her efforts after that point are also unclear.  There is little\ndocumentary evidence to show Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts have been addressed.  Absent \ncorroboration, her claims about the actions she has taken are insufficient to mitigate the resulting\nsecurity concerns.  She also indicated that she intends to resolve the remaining debts but failed to\n2\n\nprovide supporting documentation.  Overall, the evidence leaves doubts about her eligibility and\nsuitability for a security clearance.\nDiscussion\nApplicant\u2019s appeal brief contains assertions and documents that are not contained in the\nrecord.  Based on that new evidence, she argues various debts have been resolved or are being\nresolved.  However, we are prohibited from considering new evidence in reviewing appeals. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.29. \nIn her appeal brief, Applicant argues that she is not a security threat.  In this regard, we note\nthat the Federal Government is not required to wait until an applicant has mishandled or failed to\nsafeguard classified information before it can deny or revoke the applicant\u2019s access to such\ninformation.  Even if an applicant has never engaged in a security violation, the Government still can\nconsider whether an applicant\u2019s conduct or circumstances raise security concerns.  See, e.g., ISCR\nCase No.  01-06266 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 23, 2002).  Applicant\u2019s remaining arguments amount to a\ndisagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence.  For example, she argues that she has\nstrived to pay all of her debts in a timely manner.  Her arguments, however, are not sufficient to\nshow that the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to\nlaw.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-00257 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 7, 2017). \n Applicant\u2019s appeal brief failed to establish that the Judge committed any harmful error.  The\nJudge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision. \nThe decision is sustainable on this record.  \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted\nonly when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d  Department of the Navy\nv.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro se\n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On June\n7, 2018, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse)\nof Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a decision on the written record.  On October 4, 2019, after considering the record,\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Robert Robinson Gales\ndenied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6\nE3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in his findings of\nfact and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. \nConsistent with the following, we affirm.\nThe SOR alleged that Applicant used marijuana with varying frequency from about late 2010\nto mid-2016 and that he used that substance from about early 2011 to mid-2016 while holding a\nsecurity clearance.  Applicant admitted both allegations with comments.   \nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact\nApplicant, who is in his mid-30s, has been working for a defense contractor since early 2011. \nHe is married with two children.  He received an honorable discharge after serving in the military\nfor about six years.  In 2008, he was granted a security clearance that has remained active.    \nIn late 2010, Applicant \u201ccommenced what he called a \u2018minor level of participation\u2019 as well\nas \u2018limited and infrequent\u2019 use of marijuana[.]\u201d Decision at 2.  This use occurred during a vacation\nor at social gatherings.  He claimed that he never purchased marijuana, carried it anywhere, or used\nit while performing his professional responsibilities.  He never failed a drug screening test.  He\nvoluntarily reported his marijuana use when he completed a security clearance application in 2017. \nAt some point, he decided that he neither had the time nor desire to continue using marijuana.\n\u201cApplicant denied knowing the significance of using any illegal drug while granted access\nto classified information, and he contends that his marijuana use while holding his security clearance\nwas done \u2018in ignorance.\u2019\u201d  Decision at 3, quoting from Applicant\u2019s File of Relevant Material\n(FORM) Response.   He is now aware of its significance.  He submitted a letter of intent to refrain\nfrom all drug involvement and acknowledged that future use would result in an automatic revocation\nof his security clearance.  He claims he has ended his relationships with drug-using friends and\nrelatives.  No evidence of drug counseling or treatment was provided.\nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis \nApplicant\u2019s professed level of marijuana use constitutes drug involvement.  Vacations or\nsocial events are not a valid excuse to use illegal drugs.  His claim that he was ignorant of the\nsignificance of using marijuana while holding a security clearance cannot be given much weight. \n2\n\nUse of marijuana while holding a security clearance is highly significant.  No documentation,\nincluding character statements, support his claim that he has ended relationships with drug-using\nfriends or relative.     \n\u201cWith a cavalier attitude towards laws, rules, and regulations spanning over five years,\nApplicant periodically used marijuana while holding a security clearance.  Despite knowing that such\nuse was prohibited by both the Government and his employer, he claimed ignorance of the\nsignificance of doing so while holding a security clearance.\u201d  Decision at 6.  Applicant\u2019s actions,\ndespite a period of abstinence of a little over three years, continue to cast doubt on his current\nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgement. \nDiscussion\nApplicant contends the Judge erred in his findings of fact.  When a Judge\u2019s findings are\nchallenged, we examine them to see if they are supported by substantial evidence, i.e., \u201csuch relevant\nevidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the\ncontrary evidence in the same record.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 16-04094\nat 2 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2018).  Applicant argues that he did not make the statement that his \nmarijuana use was a \u201cminor level of participation\u201d but rather asserts that statement came from\ninvestigators who interviewed him.   \nIn the FORM, Department Counsel advised Applicant that he could comment on whether his\nsummarized background interview accurately reflected the information he provided to the\ninvestigators and that he could make any corrections, additions, deletions and updates necessary to\nmake the summary accurate.  In submitting his response to the FORM, Applicant did not indicate\nthat the \u201cminor level of participation\u201d statement was inaccurate or make any correction to it.  From\nour review of the record, the Judge\u2019s challenged finding was based on substantial evidence or\nconstitutes a reasonable inference that could be drawn from the evidence.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No.\n17-02225 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 25, 2019). \nApplicant next contends the Judge\u2019s finding that his marijuana use while holding a security\nclearance was done \u201cin ignorance\u201d is not representative of the statement he provided.  This\ncontention does not merit any relief.  In responding to the FORM, Applicant stated, \u201cI would like\nto clarify, that while the use did occur while in possession of a security clearance, the added offense\ndescribed in Guideline H, paragraph 25(f) was committed in ignorance.\u201d  In his appeal brief, he\nasserts that he knew his actions were unlawful but was not aware that use while holding a security\nclearance was more egregious than mere drug abuse.  He argues the Judge misrepresented his\nstatement by suggesting that he lacked the ability to discern right from wrong.  We do not interpret\nthe Judge\u2019s finding in the manner that Applicant contends.  Applicant has failed to establish that the\nJudge committed any harmful error in making this finding. \n3\n\nApplicant also contends the Judge mis-characterized his character.  For example, he takes\nexception to the Judge\u2019s conclusion that he possesses a cavalier attitude towards the law as well as,\nin his view, the Judge\u2019s implication that he was using vacations and social events as an excuse to use\nillegal drugs.  Applicant further argues that he has proven his honesty, reliability, and trustworthiness\nthrough his military and defense contractor services; that he is remorseful for his transgressions; and\nthat he is committed to abstinence.  His arguments fail to establish that the Judge either drew\nconclusions or weighed the evidence in a manner that was  arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.32.3.  \n   \nNoting the Judge\u2019s comment about the lack of character references, Applicant states that he\nchose not to present character references because he believed that his previously provided character\nreferences would be questioned.  He is most likely referring to the character references he listed in\nhis security clearance application.  His belief that Judge would question those character references\nwas incorrect.  The FORM advised Applicant that, if he did not file objections or submit additional\nmatters in response to that document, his case would be assigned to a Judge \u201cfor a determination\nbased solely on this FORM.\u201d  [Emphasis added.]  FORM at 3.  If Applicant wanted the Judge to\nconsider character references, it was his obligation to provide that information to him.  We also note\nthat a DOHA Judge has no authority to interview individuals or serve as an investigator in a case,\nwhich would be inconsistent with his or her duty of impartiality.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 16-03709\nat 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 2, 2018).\nAdditionally, Applicant states that he \u201cincorrectly assumed that [he] would be afforded the\nopportunity to provide additional evidence, in the event that [his] initial responses to the SOR and\nFORM were insufficient or inconclusive.\u201d  Applicant neither asserts nor does the record evidence\nestablish that he was misled in any way in making his forum choice or led to believe he would be\nprovided an additional opportunity beyond his FORM response to submit evidence.  As noted above,\nhe was informed that the Judge\u2019s decision would be based solely on the FORM and his response to\nit.  Applicant has not established that a due process violation occurred in the processing of his case. \n \nThe Judge examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the\ndecision.  The decision is sustainable on this record.  \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may\nbe granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d  Department\nof the Navy v.

Applicant requested a decision on the written record.  On November 18, 2019, after\nconsidering the record, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge\nCarol G. Ricciardello denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed\npursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in finding that his\nomissions from his security clearance application (SCA) were deliberate and whether the Judge\u2019s\nadverse decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we\naffirm.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact\nApplicant\u2019s SOR alleged that he had ten delinquent consumer debts, a medical debt, and\neight delinquent student loans.  The total amount of Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts was about $79,000. \nHe attributed his financial problems to four months of unemployment, medical expenses, and a\ndivorce.  He has made some payments toward satisfying the student loans and has entered into a\nrehabilitation plan for them.  The Judge noted, however, that these debts became delinquent in 2014\nbut Applicant did not begin to address them until 2019.  Applicant has been working with a debt\nresolution company that successfully disputed two of  the SOR debts.  He claims that he inherited\nsome money from his father which he will use to pay off his debts, although he did not state the\nactual amount.  \nWhen he completed his SCA, Applicant did not disclose any of his delinquent debts. \nApplicant admitted with an explanation in his SOR Response that he answered \u201cno\u201d to the question\nregarding financial problems.  In his Response to the File of Relevant Material (FORM), Applicant\nstated that he thought the interviewer was asking about his ability to pay his current bills.  Applicant\nacknowledged that he knew about the majority of his debts and did not know why he answered the\nSCA question as he did.  He stated that he had been rushed to complete the SCA.  \nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis\nThe Judge entered favorable findings about the two debts that had been removed from\nApplicant\u2019s credit report.  She arrived at the opposite conclusion regarding the remainder, on the\nground that Applicant had not demonstrated resolution of any of them.  She noted his payments\ntoward his student loans.  However, she also noted that he did not begin to address them until after\nhis security clearance interview, which placed him on notice that his clearance was in jeopardy. \nThough noting circumstances beyond Applicant\u2019s control that affected his debts, she concluded that\nhe had not demonstrated responsible action in regard to them.\n2\n\nConcerning the SCA omissions alleged under Guideline E, the Judge cited to Applicant\u2019s\nexplanation that he had been rushed and made an honest mistake.  She stated, however, that\nApplicant had answered other questions on the SCA in some detail, and she cited to his initial denial\nof financial problems during his interview, finding Applicant\u2019s explanation that he misunderstood\nthe investigator\u2019s question to be lacking in credibility.  She found that Applicant had deliberately\nomitted material information from his SCA and that he had made no good-faith effort to correct the\nomissions before he was confronted with them.\nDiscussion\nApplicant\u2019s appeal brief includes information from outside the record, which we cannot\nconsider.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.  Applicant denies that his SCA omissions were deliberate, arguing\nthat there were multiple windows open on his computer screen at the time he completed his SCA and\nthat he became confused.  When an applicant denies that a false statement was intentional, the Judge\nshould evaluate his mens rea in light of the entirety of the record evidence.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No.\n14-04226 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). \nThe explanation Applicant provided in his appeal brief, in addition to being new evidence,\nis different from, if not inconsistent with, his FORM Response described above and with his Answer\nto the SOR, in which he stated simply that his denials of financial problems were \u201cnot what I\nexpected to answer.\u201d  We note the Judge\u2019s finding that Applicant apparently took care elsewhere in\nthe SCA to provide detailed information.  We also note evidence that Applicant attended college and\nthat he has prior experience in completing an SCA.  All in all, the challenged finding is supported\nby substantial evidence and is sustainable.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 18-01564 at 3 (App. Bd. May\n30, 2019).\nApplicant cites to favorable evidence, such as his efforts at paying his student loans and his\nrehabilitation program for the loans; his having hired a debt resolution company; his successful\ndispute of two debts; his explanation for his initial denial to the interviewer of financial problems,\nand his having held a clearance for many years without incident or concern.  These were all matters\nthat the Judge was required to consider, along with all the other evidence in the record.  However,\na Judge is not expected explicitly to discuss all aspects of an applicant\u2019s record, which would be an\nimpossibility.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 16-02243 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 30, 2018).  Applicant\u2019s\narguments on appeal are not enough to rebut the presumption that the Judge considered all of the\nevidence in the record, nor are they enough to show that the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner\nthat was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 18-01482 at 2 (App. Bd.\nSep. 6, 2019).       \nThe record supports a conclusion that the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated\na satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found\nand the choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

The Judge\u2019s favorable findings under Guideline E are not\nat issue in this appeal.  Consistent with the following, we affirm.\nApplicant owes about $64,000 in delinquent debts.  He attributed his financial problems to\nseveral things:  a two-year period in which his wife was stationed overseas; a year and a half of\nunemployment while caring for his ill father; and to medical treatment.   In his security clearance\napplication, Applicant disclosed unemployment during all of 2017 as well, although he later stated\nthat he had been self-employed during that time.  Applicant disclosed that he was homeless for about\nthree months in 2017.  He has a tentative payment plan but is waiting on the result of his clearance\nadjudication before implementing it.  Applicant submitted information from a credit management\ncompany and an enrollment letter from a financial education company.  His financial statement\nshows a negative balance of nearly $1,300.  In January 2020 his salary was increased to $80,000, and\nhe receives income from two investment properties.  Applicant served in the military, deploying\nabroad in support of U.S. military objectives.  His employer describes him as trustworthy, honest,\nand loyal.  \nThe Judge characterized Applicant\u2019s presentation as promises to pay off debts in the future,\nwhich he found insufficient to mitigate the concerns addressed in the SOR.  He stated that Applicant\nhad not demonstrated reasonable efforts to pay his debts and that there is insufficient evidence that\nhis financial problems will be resolved in the near future.  The Judge cited to Applicant\u2019s military\nservice, his employment history, his delinquent debts, and the circumstances underlying them.  He\nultimately concluded that Applicant had not met his burden of persuasion to mitigation.\nApplicant cites to various pieces of record evidence which, he contends, the Judge did not\nconsider or that he mis-weighed, including his period of homelessness, his unemployment, his care\nfor his father, his tentative payment plan, etc.  The Judge made findings about the things that\nApplicant has mentioned and explicitly addressed at least some of them in his Analysis.

Foreman denied Applicant\u2019s request for a\nsecurity clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nThe SOR alleged that Applicant had filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection four times \nbetween April 2014 and January 2017.  The petitions were dismissed each time.  The SOR also\nalleged eight delinquent debts.  The Judge found in Applicant\u2019s favor regarding five of the debts and\nentered adverse findings for the remaining allegations.  \nApplicant\u2019s brief raises an issue of due process.  In presenting his argument, Applicant makes\nassertions from outside the record.  Normally, we are not permitted to consider new evidence. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.29.  However, we will consider new evidence insofar as it pertains to threshold\nissues such as jurisdiction or due process.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No.  18-01764 at 1-2 (App. Bd. Jun.\n4, 2019).  \nApplicant contends that he requested additional time in which to respond to the File of\nRelevant Material (FORM).  He states that he advised the Judge that he needed extra time in which\nto obtain documentary evidence because he was deployed overseas.  There is nothing in the file to\ncorroborate Applicant\u2019s assertion.  The record shows that he received the FORM on October 23,\n2019.  However, it contains no evidence of any response by Applicant.  In his Reply Brief, Counsel\nstates that he is aware of no such request for extension, and the Decision itself states simply that\nApplicant did not respond to the FORM.\nAlthough we give due consideration to Applicant\u2019s brief, in the past we have held it\nreasonable for applicants to corroborate their claims to have sent to the Judge evidence that did not\nmake it into the record.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-02109 at 2 (App. Bd. Mar. 6, 2019).

Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.  \nApplicant indicates that losing her job will have a negative impact on her financial situation. \nHowever, the impact of an unfavorable decision on an applicant is not a relevant consideration in\ndetermining his or her eligibility for a trustworthiness designation.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On June\n11, 2019, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E\n(Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended)\n(Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On October 25, 2019, after the hearing, Administrative\nJudge Noreen A. Lynch denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed\npursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.  The Judge\u2019s favorable Guideline E findings have not\nbeen raised as an issue on appeal and are not discussed below.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge erred in her findings of fact\nor conclusions and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. \nConsistent with the following, we affirm.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact  \nApplicant, who is in her late 40s, has been working for Federal contractors since 1993.  She\nis divorced and has no children.  She has held a security clearance for over 25 years.  \nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleged seven delinquent debts totaling about $46,000.  She\ndenied four of those allegations, claiming she had no knowledge of the denied accounts before\nreceiving the SOR.  In 2013, Applicant was unemployed for about nine months when she cared for\nher ailing father who is now deceased.  In 2018, her fianc\u00e9 passed away and she had to pay the\nfuneral expenses.  They had lived together for about ten years, and he handled all of the finances and\nbills.  She acknowledged that they went through a financial hardship after he retired and that she had\nnot been diligent.    \nAt the time of the hearing, none of the debts were paid or in payment plans.  She noted that\nshe received credit counseling and was working on a debt consolidation plan but presented no\nevidence.  In her post-hearing submission, she indicated that she contacted all of the creditors and\nplanned to send monthly payments to settle some of the debts.  She provided documentation showing\none debt was canceled and she received an offer to settle another debt.  She also indicated that she\ncould not obtain information on a debt because the collection company had no record of her and she\npaid $60 on a medical debt.  She did not provide any proof of payments.\nApplicant\u2019s annual income is between $100,000 to $110,000.  She has about $8,000 in an\nIRA account.  She purchased a 2017 luxury car and has a $700 monthly car payment.  \u201cShe has plans\nto pay her debts, but none of them have been resolved or are in a permanent payment plan.  She\npresented no documentation of any payment plans or receipts for payments.  She appeared somewhat\nvague and confused about the debts.\u201d [Decision at 3.]      \n2\n\nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis\nAlthough Applicant experienced circumstances beyond her control, she did not act\nresponsibly.  She earns a good salary but does not seem to have a handle on her financial situation. \nShe provided no evidence of payments or payment arrangements.  After the hearing, she provided\ndocuments to show she is beginning to contact creditors to resolve the debts, but she has not initiated\nany plans.  Promises to pay debts in the future are not sufficient.  She has not met her burden to\nmitigate the security concerns.   \nDiscussion\nApplicant challenges a number of the Judge\u2019s findings and conclusions.  For example,\nApplicant contends that the Judge erred by concluding \u201c[s]he has not done anything to resolve any\nof the accounts.  She has not received financial counseling.  There is no evidence of payments and\npayment plans.\u201d  Appeal Brief at 1, quoting Decision at 8.  In support of her argument, Applicant\npoints to post-hearing submission that she prepared summarizing her actions to contact creditors and\nestablish payment plans.  This statement also reflects that she has sought the assistance of a debt\nconsolidation company to help resolve some of the alleged debts.  Given that this statement\nconstitutes evidence of her actions to resolve the debts, including the establishment of payment\nplans, the Judge\u2019s conclusions quoted above, as well as some other similar conclusions, are not\naccurate.  These errors, however, are harmless because they did not likely affect the outcome of the\ncase.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No 11-15184 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 25, 2013).  In this regard, the Appeal\nBoard has previously noted that it is reasonable to expect that an applicant should present\ncorroborating documentation of actions taken to resolve debts.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-07062\nat 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 21, 2017).  The evidence that Applicant presented generally lacks such\ncorroborating documentation.  Moreover, as the Judge noted Applicant\u2019s case in mitigation primarily\namounts to a promise to pay the debts in the future, which we have previously stated, is not a\nsubstitute for a track record of paying debts in a timely manner and otherwise acting in a financially\nresponsible manner.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-04565 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 18, 2015).   The Judge\u2019s\nconclusion that Applicant failed to meet her burden to mitigate the security concerns arising from\nher debts is sustainable.\n    \nIn furtherance of her challenge to the Judge\u2019s conclusion that she has not done anything to\nresolve the delinquent debts, Applicant also points to a credit report (Government Exhibit 3)\nclaiming it shows she disputed three of the alleged debts.   For one of these debts, a charged-off debt\nfor about $7,400, the credit report does not reflect that it was disputed and, at the hearing, Applicant\nadmitted she was responsible for it.  Tr. at 62-63.    For the remaining two debts, the credit report \nreflects that Applicant disputed them; however, she admitted she was responsible for both of those\ndebts at the hearing.  Tr. at 61 and 67-68.  This assignment of error does not merit any relief. \nIn her brief, Applicant also challenges the Judge\u2019s finding that she purchased a 2017 luxury\ncar.  In doing so, she notes, for example, the car is a 2016 model.  However, at the hearing, she\nidentified it as a 2017 model.  Tr. at 69.   From our review of the evidence, the Judge\u2019s findings\nregarding the car are based on substantial evidence or constitute reasonable inferences that could be\n3\n\ndrawn from the evidence.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-02225 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 25, 2019). \nApplicant also notes that the Judge erred in finding she has worked for Federal contractors since\n1993.  She notes that she worked for the Federal Government from about 2008 to 2013.  Tr. at 13.\nThis discrepancy regarding her prior employment is a harmless error.   See, e.g., ISCR Case No 11-\n15184 at 3.  \n \nApplicant further argues that she has worked diligently since her fianc\u00e9 passed away to take\nresponsibility for her finances and resolve her debts.  These  arguments are not sufficient to establish\nthat the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-00650 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 27, 2016). \nThe Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the\ndecision.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro se\n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On June\n26, 2019, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) of Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  On October 17, 2019, Department Counsel\namended the SOR by adding an allegation under Guideline H (Drug Involvement and Substance\nMisuse).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On January 28, 2020, after the hearing, Defense Office of\nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Darlene D. Lokey Anderson denied\nApplicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28\nand E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge was biased against him\nand whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  The Judge\u2019s\nfavorable findings under Guideline B were not raised as an issue on appeal.  Consistent with the\nfollowing, we affirm.\nThe Judge found against Applicant on the Guideline H allegation that asserted he used\nmarijuana with varying frequency from about February 2017 to February 2018 while being granted\naccess to classified information.  In his response to the SOR, he admitted that allegation.  Although\nhe was aware that marijuana use was prohibited under Federal law, he obtained a doctor\u2019s\nprescription for its use after a knee injury.  \u201cHe did not report his marijuana use on his [December\n2017] security clearance application because he did not see it as an issue.\u201d  Decision at 3.  He\nsubmitted a Statement of Intent to refrain from marijuana use in the future.  His manager, coworkers,\nand friends attest to his good character and recommend him for a security clearance.  The Judge\nconcluded that none of the Guideline H mitigating conditions fully applied.    \nIn his appeal brief, Applicant essentially contends that the Judge was biased against him.  He \nargues that, while the Judge was overall very professional and courteous, she \u201cdemonstrated anger\nin her retorts and on the record interrupted the Applicant while attempting to speak on 7 separate\noccasions.\u201d  Appeal Brief at 2-3.  He also noted the Judge was ready to close the hearing before\nproviding him an opportunity to make a closing statement.  There is a rebuttable presumption that\na Judge is impartial and unbiased, and a party seeking to overcome that presumption has a heavy\nburden of persuasion.  See, e. g., ISCR Case No. 18-02722 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 30, 2020).  We have\nexamined the Decision in light of the record as a whole and find nothing that would likely convince\na reasonable person that the Judge lacked the requisite impartiality.  Applicant has not met his heavy\nburden of persuasion on this issue. \nApplicant also contends that the Judge did not consider or properly weigh all relevant\nevidence.  For example, he argues that the Judge overlooked his character evidence, his special\nknowledge that is critical to the Government, and his Statement of Intent to refrain from using\nmarijuana in the future.  He also highlights evidence that supports favorable findings on whole-\nperson factors.  His arguments, however, are neither enough to rebut the presumption that the Judge\nconsidered all of the record evidence nor sufficient to show that the Judge weighed the evidence in\na manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-02488 at\n3 (App. Bd. Aug. 30, 2018).  Furthermore, the value of an applicant's expertise to a defense\n2\n\ncontractor is not a relevant or material consideration in determining his or her suitability for a\nsecurity clearance.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 7 (App. Bd. Jun. 4, 2001).  Applicant has\nfailed to establish that the Judge committed harmful error in her analysis of the evidence, including\nher  whole-person assessment. \nThe Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the\ndecision.

Since then, he has returned to Sudan to visit family despite the\nrisk.\nApplicant\u2019s sibling, sibling-in-law, half-sibling, and cousin are citizens and residents of\nSudan.  His sibling and sibling-in-law held high-level positions in the Sudanese Government before\na military coup in 2019.  Applicant admitted that his sibling could be in danger for previous\ninvolvement with the Sudanese Government.  His half-sibling lives in a dangerous part of the\ncountry.  He communicates with his half-sibling sporadically, and they met on one of his most recent\ntrips there.  He has weekly communication with his cousin who is a law enforcement officer.   \nIn 1993, Sudan was designated a State Sponsor of Terrorism.  In 2002, the U.S. Embassy in\nSudan reopened after being closed for about six years.  In 2003 and 2011, Sudan experienced\nconflicts that displaced millions of people and resulted in thousands of deaths.  Although fighting\nhas largely subsided, low-level violence continues largely due to the weak rule of law.  Since 2007,\nUnited Nations and African Union forces have jointly conducted peacekeeping operations in Darfur,\nand those forces have been the targets of armed groups.  In 2019, a military coup overthrew the\nrepublican government.  A national state of emergency is in effect across Sudan.  Human rights\nabuses, such as arbitrary killings and detentions, have been reported.   The U.S. State Department\nhas issued a \u201cdo not travel\u201d warning for Sudan.    \nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis\nNoting that Applicant maintains frequent and regular contact with his family members in\nSudan, particularly his sibling and cousin, the Judge found that Disqualifying Conditions 7(a) and\n2\n\n(b)1 apply to his circumstances.  In her mitigation analysis, the Judge concluded that Applicant had\nstrong and longstanding ties to the United States.  Even though his sibling and sibling-in-law may\nbe held accountable in Sudan for their involvement with the previous regime, Applicant would\nsupport such an inquiry.  All of Applicant\u2019s assets are in the United States.  Applicant\u2019s oath of\nallegiance to the United States and his candor throughout the security clearance process are sufficient\nto mitigate the security concerns raised by his family contacts in Sudan.     \nDiscussion\nThere is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.  See\nDorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  The\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate admitted or\nproven facts.  The applicant has the burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable decision. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15.  The standard applicable in security clearance decisions \u201cis that a clearance may\nbe granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of\nthe Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for\nnational security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  Directive, Encl. 2,\nApp. A \u00b6 2(b).  \nIn deciding whether the Judge\u2019s rulings or conclusions are erroneous, we will review the\nJudge\u2019s decision to determine whether:  it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate\na satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts found\nand the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of judgment; it fails\nto consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary\nto the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference of\nopinion.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-02563 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 28, 2015).\nIn foreign influence cases, the nature of the foreign government involved, its human rights\nrecord, and the presence of terrorist activity are important considerations that provide context for the\nother record evidence and must be brought to bear on the Judge\u2019s ultimate conclusions in the case. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 16-04056 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Sep. 6, 2018) and Directive, Encl. 2, App. A\n\u00b6 6.  Department Counsel notes the Judge stated, \u201can applicant with familial or other connections\nto a hostile foreign country faces a heavy burden in mitigating security concerns raised by such\nforeign ties.\u201d  Decision at 8.  Department Counsel points out the burden placed on an applicant who\nhas close family members in a hostile country is a \u201cvery heavy burden\u201d and argues the Judge did not\napply that standard.  Much of Department Counsel\u2019s argument is based on the conditions that exist\nin Sudan.  In ISCR Case No. 19-01689 at 3 (App. Bd. Jun. 8, 2020), we stated that application of the\n\u201cvery heavy burden\u201d mitigation standard is not based on the conditions in a foreign country but\n1  Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and (b): \u201ccontact . . . with a foreign family member . . . who is a citizen of\nor resident in a foreign country, if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement,\nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion;\u201d and \u201cconnections to a foreign person . . . that create a potential conflict of interest\nbetween the individual\u2019s obligation to protect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire\nto help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information or technology[.]\u201d\n3\n\ninstead on whether that country has interests or policies that are adverse to U.S. interests or that it\nhas taken actions that threaten U.S. national security.  We recognize Sudanese Government has\nrecently changed and conclude that a determination of whether the \u201cvery heavy burden\u201d applies in\nthis case is not needed to resolve the issues before us.  \nDepartment Counsel contends that the Judge failed to apply properly the mitigating\nconditions.  He argues the Judge\u2019s analysis \u201cwas generic and did not specifically discuss individual\nfacts as they might apply to a particular Mitigating Condition.\u201d  Appeal Brief at 12.  We find this\nargument to be persuasive.  A Judge is presumed to have considered all of the evidence in the record. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 18-01482 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 6, 2019).  A Judge also has wide latitude in\nwriting a decision and is not expected to discuss every piece of record evidence.  See, e.g., ISCR\nCase No. 16-02243 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 30, 2018).  However, a Judge cannot ignore, disregard, or\nfail to discuss record evidence that a reasonable person could expect to be taken into account in\nreaching a fair and reasoned decision.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-02903 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 9,\n2017).\nDepartment Counsel argues that Applicant\u2019s foreign family members\u2019 activities and status\nwere important factors to be considered in the mitigation analysis.  We agree.   Applicant\u2019s sibling\nand sibling-in-law served in high-level governmental positions in the former regime.  Applicant\nacknowledged that these relatives \u201cmay be held accountable for their past involvement with the\ncorrupt [former] government.\u201d   Decision at 8.  In the past, we have recognized that an applicant\u2019s\nties, either directly or through a family member, to persons of high rank in a foreign government or\nmilitary are of particular concern, insofar as it is foreseeable that through an association with such\npersons the applicant could come to the attention of those interested in acquiring U.S. protected\ninformation.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01979 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 31, 2019)(citing other cases\ninvolving applicants with high-level foreign governmental relatives or contacts).  Given the facts in\nthis case, it is foreseeable that Applicant\u2019s sibling and sibling-in-law could become a means through\nwhich a foreign person, group, or government could attempt to exert pressure on him.  Department\nCounsel persuasively argues that there is no way gauge how Applicant would react to threats of\nviolence against his family members.  The Judge erred in failing to analyze the security significance\narising from the former status and activities of these family members.   \nDepartment Counsel challenges the Judge conclusions that Applicant\u2019s \u201cclosest family, life,\nand assets are in the United States\u201d and he has \u201cstrong and longstanding ties to the United States.\u201d \nDecision at 8.  Department Counsel effectively argues the Judge erred in failing to analyze  evidence\nas well as the lack of evidence that undermines those conclusions, such as:\na.  Applicant had been in the United States for about 10 years and a citizen for about five\nyears.  Decision at 3.\nb.  Applicant\u2019s wife and minor children are temporarily living in an African country with her\nfamily.  His children will attend school there.  He indicated his plan was for them to return in the\nsummer of 2020 unless he got a job outside the United States for a year or two because to leave them\nalone in the United States was not an option.  Tr. at 72-75, 77-79.\n4\n\nc.  No evidence was offered establishing that Applicant has other significant relationships\nor ties in the United States.  Appeal Brief at 16.  \nd.  During a background interview, Applicant stated that he did not intend to renounce his\nSudanese citizenship because he hoped to help the Sudanese people in an ambassador-type role and\nassist with positive change in that country.  GE 4 at 14.  At the hearing, he testified that he still\nintended to serve is such a role and stated, \u201c[b]ut Sudan, of course, is my motherland country.  So,\nI have the moral obligation to defend the rights, especially the Darfurian people who have been\noppressed for a long time.\u201d  Tr. at 59.\ne.  Applicant does not own a house in the United States.  While he has a bank account in the\nUnited States, he did not disclose its balance.  Besides working for ride-sharing companies, he has\nhad part-time employment in the United States.  He describes his financial situation  as \u201cI\u2019m not that\nvery steady.\u201d  Tr. at 13, 71-72.\nf.  At one point, Applicant testified that it was a possibility he could retire in Sudan as a U.S.\ncitizen promoting human rights.  Tr. at 70-71.  At another point, he stated that he did not believe\nretiring in Sudan would be an option.  Tr. at 77.\nDepartment Counsel challenges the Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant\u2019s contact or\ncommunication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that there is little likelihood it could\ncreate foreign influence or exploitation.  Department Counsel argues that the Judge contradicted this\nconclusion when she earlier stated, \u201cthat Applicant did not rebut the legal presumption of close\nfamilial bonds or ties to his family in Sudan.\u201d  Appeal Brief at 18, quoting from Decision at 7.\nDepartment Counsel convincingly argues that the evidence of Applicant\u2019s frequent and regular\ncontact with his sibling and cousin, as well as the presumptive ties of affection or obligation to his\nsibling-in-law, was sufficient to refute the challenged conclusion. \nApplicant has been a target of the former regime in Sudan.  In the past, the Sudanese\nGovernment had him arrested and detained in another country.  While Applicant has traveled to\nSudan in recent years, he did not travel there in 2019 to visit a dying parent because he would be in\ndanger.  On that occasion, family members advised him that they did not \u201cwant to have two tragedies\nat the same time.\u201d  Tr. at 85.  Given that this event occurred recently, it is reasonable to conclude that\ndanger has not ceased.  Moreover, when that danger may cease is unknown.  There is no evidence\nin the record to confirm that Applicant would not travel there while that danger continues to exist. \nThe Judge failed to address the obvious risk of foreign exploitation that would arise if Applicant\ntraveled to Sudan before the danger ceased.\n    \nConsidering the security concerns present in this case, the record evidence is not sufficient\nto demonstrate that Applicant\u2019s relationships and loyalties in the U.S. would necessarily outweigh\nhis sense of loyalty or obligation to his relatives in Sudan.  Application of the guidelines is not a\ncomment on an applicant\u2019s patriotism but merely an acknowledgment that people may act in\nunpredictable ways when faced with choices that could be important to a loved-one, such as a family\n5\n\nmember.  As stated above, any doubt concerning security clearance eligibility must be resolved in\nfavor of the national security. \nBased on our review of the record, we conclude that the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary and\ncapricious because it fails to articulate a rational connection between the facts found and the choice\nmade, fails to consider important aspects of the case, and runs contrary to the weight of the record\nevidence.  Furthermore, we conclude that the record evidence, viewed as a whole, is not sufficient\nto mitigate the Government\u2019s security concerns under the Egan standard.  The decision is not\nsustainable.\n6\n\nOrder\nThe Decision is REVERSED.        \nSigned: Michael Ra\u2019anan               \nMichael Ra\u2019anan\nAdministrative Judge\nChairperson, Appeal Board\nSigned: James E.

The record evidence does not\ndescribe Afghanistan as a hostile country.  Department Counsel cites no prior Appeal Board\ndecision in which we concluded Afghanistan was a hostile country.  Her arguments for\napplication of the \u201cvery heavy burden\u201d mitigation standard are based on conditions in that\ncountry \u2013 such as terrorism, unrest, and instability \u2013 as opposed to any actions taken by the\nAfghan Government.  Department Counsel has failed show that the Afghan Government\u2019s\ninterests are adverse to U.S. interests or that it has established policies or taken actions that\nthreaten U.S. national security.

Corrales, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro se\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On\nAugust 29, 2019, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) of Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a decision on the\nwritten record.  On February 26, 2020, after considering the record, Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge John Bayard Glendon granted Applicant\u2019s request for a\nsecurity clearance.  Department Counsel appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nDepartment Counsel raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in his\napplication of a mitigating condition and in his whole-person analysis.  Consistent with the following\ndiscussion, we affirm the Judge\u2019s decision.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact\nApplicant, who is in his late 30s, was born in Afghanistan.  He graduated from high school\nin Pakistan after his family relocated there as refugees.  About 11 years ago, he met a woman online\nwho was born in Afghanistan and held U.S. citizenship.  They married a year later in Pakistan.  His\nwife had three adult children who held dual U.S. and Afghan citizenship.  One child lived in\nAfghanistan and the other two in the United States.  After his marriage, Applicant returned to\nAfghanistan and applied for a U.S. visa as the spouse of a citizen.  He entered the U.S. in late 2013. \nIn 2014, his attempt to enlist in the U.S. military was unsuccessful due to his failure of the vocational\naptitude test.  He and his wife separated in early 2017.  He became a U.S. citizen in early 2018.  He\nand his wife divorced later that year.  He began his current employment in 2018.\nApplicant\u2019s mother and three of his siblings are citizens and residents of Afghanistan.  Those\nsiblings are married and have children.  His father is deceased.  He has weekly telephone contact\nwith his mother and one sibling and monthly or quarterly telephone contact with the other two\nsiblings.  He has provided his mother about $200 per month as support.  In 2016 and 2018, he visited\nhis family in Afghanistan.  He possesses U.S. and Afghan passports.  In a counterintelligence\nscreening interview, he indicated that he did not intend to renounce his Afghan citizenship so that\nhe could travel there without the need for applying for a visa.   Applicant also has a friend who is \nin the Afghan military.  He has monthly contact with this friend and does not discuss work with him. \n\u201cIn his June 2018 Interview, Applicant reportedly said that if he worked for the U.S.\nGovernment in Afghanistan, he would be concerned about the safety of his mother and one of his\nthree sisters in Afghanistan.  He planned to deal with this concern by keeping work there a secret. \n2\n\nHe also stated, however, that if his family was ever threatened, he would not betray his country.  He\nfurther stated that he would never betray the U.S. or Afghanistan.\u201d  Decision at 3.  In his SOR\nResponse, Applicant stated his answer to a question during a security screening about his allegiance\nto Afghanistan was misunderstood.  He indicated that the security and national interest of the United\nStates are his priority and his allegiance to Afghanistan is just due to it being his country of birth,\nnoting his future belongs in the United States.\nA U.S. Air Force captain indicated that Applicant has \u201cthe highest level of moral\ncharacter[,]\u201d is a \u201cvery trustworthy American[,]\u201d and put himself at personal risk in physically\nescorting the remains of deceased coalition forces to a safe area after an attack.  Decision at 4.  Other\nU.S. and foreign  military personnel commend Applicant for his loyalty, character, and performance\nof duties.  Two U.S. military members co-wrote a memorandum stating, \u201cI trust [Applicant] with my\nlife on every mission; his action in supporting the United States is a testament to his loyalty to our\nnation.\u201d  Id.\nThe Taliban and other extremist groups are active throughout Afghanistan and present a\nserious challenge to the government.  Due to terrorism, crime, civil unrest, and armed conflict, the\nU.S. State Department advises the security situation in Afghanistan is extremely unstable and the\nthreat to U.S. citizens is critical.  This country also experiences widespread disregard for the law and\nhuman rights abuses without effective government action to curtail them.  \nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis\nApplicant\u2019s family and personal ties establish a heightened risk of foreign exploitation,\ninducement, etc., and a potential conflict of interest between his obligation to protect classified\ninformation and his desire to help foreign individuals.  Mitigating Condition 8(b)1 was established. \nApplicant has made a significant contribution to U.S. national security in a dangerous war zone. \n\u201cHis actions constitute important evidence that his ties and sense of obligation to the United States\nare sufficiently strong that he can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S.\u201d \nDecision at 8, citing various Appeal Board decisions for that proposition.  \nDiscussion\nThere is no presumption of error below, and the appealing party has the burden of raising and\ndemonstrating factual or legal error by the Administrative Judge.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 00-0339\nat 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 22, 2001).  In this case, Department Counsel has not challenged any of the\nJudge\u2019s findings of fact.  Instead, her appeal brief contends that the Judge erred in his application\nof  Mitigating Condition 8(b) and in his whole-person assessment.\n1  Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6 8(b) states, \u201cthere is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense\nof loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, government, or country is so minimal, or the\nindividual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the individual can be\nexpected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest[.]\u201d\n3\n\nThe Judge concluded that Applicant\u2019s contacts in Afghanistan present a heightened risk and\nanalyzed the case accordingly.  However, Department Counsel argues that the conditions in\nAfghanistan are hostile to U.S. national security interests and, therefore, Applicant should have a\n\u201cvery heavy burden\u201d placed on him to mitigate the resulting foreign influence security concerns.  See \nISCR Case No. 17-04208 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 7, 2019) as an example of the application of the \u201cvery\nheavy burden\u201d mitigation standard in a case involving a hostile country.  The record evidence does\nnot describe Afghanistan as a hostile country.  Department Counsel cites no prior Appeal Board\ndecision in which we concluded Afghanistan was a hostile country.  Her arguments for application\nof the \u201cvery heavy burden\u201d mitigation standard are based on conditions in that country \u2013 such as\nterrorism, unrest, and instability \u2013 as opposed to any actions taken by the Afghan Government. \nDepartment Counsel has failed show that the Afghan Government\u2019s interests are adverse to U.S.\ninterests or that it has established policies or taken actions that threaten U.S. national security.  She\nhas not cited any evidence showing that Afghanistan is involved in any form of espionage against\nthe United States.  To the contrary, Department Counsel notes in her appeal brief that Afghanistan\nhas had a democratic government since 2004.  Appeal Brief at 5.  Additionally, the U.S. State\nDepartment Country Reports on Terrorism 2018 states that Afghan Government cooperates with the\nUnited States in bilateral counterterrorism efforts.  Hearing Exhibit I.  We conclude the Judge\ncommitted no error by not applying the \u201cvery heavy burden\u201d mitigation standard in this case. \nThe remainder of Department Counsel\u2019s arguments amount to a disagreement with the\nJudge\u2019s weighing of the evidence.  She raises concerns about some of Applicant\u2019s purported\nstatements reflected in a report of a military counterintelligence security screening conducted in mid-\n2018.  During that screening, he reportedly stated that he had equal allegiance with Afghanistan and\nthe United States, that he would never betray the U.S. or Afghanistan, that he had concerns about\nthe safety of his family members living in Afghanistan, and that his position supporting U.S. forces\nin Afghanistan could endanger his family.  FORM Item 4 at 2, 8, and 11.  Department Counsel\nargues these statements are evidence of a \u201cdivided allegiance\u201d that create foreign influence security\nconcerns.2  Quoting from Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6 6. She further argues:\nIt was only after receiving the SOR that Applicant did an about-face and claimed that\none of his expressions of dual allegiance was a misunderstanding.  At no point, to\n2  An individual\u2019s feeling toward a foreign country, of course, can raise Guideline B security concerns.  In the\npast, for example, we have stated:\nFor purposes of Guideline B, it does not matter whether an applicant is at risk because the applicant: \n(1) may be influenced through favorable feelings toward the government or regime of a foreign nation;\n(2) may be influenced through favorable feelings toward the people (including the applicant\u2019s\nrelatives) and culture of a foreign nation; (3) may be influenced through a desire to avoid harm to, or\nto gain the benefit for, his relatives in a foreign nation; or (4) some combination or variation of such\nconcerns.  See, e.g. ISCR Case No. 99-0511 (December 19, 2000) at pp. 10-11 (foreign influence\nissues are not limited to situations involving coercive means of influence; rather, they can include\nsituations where an applicant may be vulnerable to noncoercive means of influence).\nISCR Case No. 99-0601 at 6 (App. Bd. Jan. 30, 2001). \n4\n\ninclude in his response to the FORM, did Applicant suggest that the second statement\nalso was the result of a misunderstanding.  Nevertheless, relying exclusively on\nApplicant\u2019s self-serving response to the SOR, the Administrative Judge perfunctorily \nfound that Applicant\u2019s statement that his allegiance to Afghanistan is equal to the\nU.S. was the \u2018result of a misunderstanding during [a counterintelligence screening] \ninterview.\u2019  In so finding, the Judge failed to explain how he reached this conclusion,\nnor did he acknowledge and analyze the significance of his lack of ties in the United\nStates.  [Appeal Brief at 12.]  \nThese arguments are not persuasive.  The Judge essentially addressed these issues.  He made\nfindings about Applicant\u2019s purported statements during the counterintelligence security screening\nas well as Applicant\u2019s claim in responding to the SOR that the statement alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e3 was\na misunderstanding and that \u201cthe United States was his priority.\u201d  Regarding Department Counsel\u2019s\ncontention that Applicant made an \u201cabout-face\u201d claim in his SOR Response, there no evidence that\nApplicant was aware of the purported statement in \u00b6 1.e until he received the SOR or that he even\nhad the opportunity to review the counterintelligence security screening report after it was prepared\nuntil he received the FORM.  Further, although Department Counsel mentions a second statement\nin her argument, only one of Applicant\u2019s statements was alleged in the SOR, which is most likely\nthe reason why he only addressed that statement.  In the decision, the Judge concluded, \u201cGiven\nApplicant\u2019s clarifying explanation in his Answer, the facts surrounding this allegation [SOR \u00b6 1.e]\ndo not give rise to a security concern under Guideline B.\u201d  Decision at 7.  On appeal, this conclusion\nis reviewed to determine whether it was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.32.3.  Based on our review of the record, we cannot conclude the Judge erred in reaching that\nconclusion.  In this regard, we also note that Department Counsel does not specifically address that,\nafter Applicant\u2019s military counterintelligence security screening, he was permitted to begin his\ncurrent employment with U.S. and coalition forces in Afghanistan in the fall of 2018.  FORM Item\n4.  It is reasonable to infer that the counterintelligence screening authorities would have precluded\nApplicant from assuming that employment if they concluded any force protection or related security\nconcerns arose from his statements during that screening. \n The Judge concluded that the certain SOR allegations established disqualifying conditions\nand relied solely on Mitigating Condition 8(b) to conclude the resulting security concerns were\nmitigated.  Department Counsel argues that the Judge erred in applying that mitigating condition\nbecause he failed to adequately address Applicant\u2019s purported dual allegiance (discussed above) and\nhis minimal contacts in the United States.  In his analysis of Mitigation Condition 8(b), the Judge \nfocused on Applicant\u2019s support of U.S. and coalition forces in Afghanistan, including his conduct\nin the face of danger.  As we have previously stated, credible, independent evidence of conduct under\ndangerous, high-risk circumstances that significantly contributes to national security is a relevant\nfactor to consider in Guideline B cases.   See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-25928 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Apr.\n9, 2008), citing other Appeal Board decisions supporting that proposition.  Such conduct lends\n3  SOR \u00b6 1.e stated, \u201cDuring a counterintelligence screening conducted in June 2018, when asked \u201cIs there any\ncountry that you have allegiance over the US?\u201d you answered, \u201cAfghanistan is equal in allegiance.\u201d\n5\n\ncredibility to an applicant\u2019s claim that he or she can be relied upon to recognize, resist, and report\nany attempts at coercion or exploitation.  Id.  Likewise, such conduct could constitute important\nevidence that an applicant\u2019s ties and sense of obligation to the U.S. are sufficiently strong to\nconclude he or she could be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S.  Id.  In\nthis case, we find no reason to conclude the Judge erred in his weighing of the evidence pertaining\nto Mitigating Condition 8(b).   \nIn general, Department Counsel has not rebutted the presumption that the Judge considered\nall the evidence in the record, nor has she shown the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that\nwas arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to the evidence.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-00303 at 3 (App.\nBd. Jan. 29, 2018).  Department Counsel has not established that the Judge committed any harmful\nerror.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro se\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On June\n28, 2019, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of Department of\n\nDefense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a decision\non the written record.  On March 10, 2020, after considering the record, Administrative Judge Eric\nH. Borgstrom denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we affirm.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis\nApplicant, who is in her 50s, works for a defense contractor.  She is married and has two\nadult children.  The SOR alleged that she has four delinquent debts, which consist of three student\nloans and a credit card account.  In responding to the SOR, Applicant admitted the three student\nloans and disputed the credit card account.   \nApplicant cosigned the three student loans so that her eldest child could attend college\nbetween 2006 and 2012.  In 2013 and 2014, the three student loans, totaling about $66,000, were\nplaced for collection.  In a background interview, she indicated her eldest child was responsible for \nrepayment of those student loans, noted she received no communications from the creditor, and\nstated she had no intent to take further action regarding them.  She was taking action to resolve other\nnon-alleged student loans.   Applicant\u2019s credit report reflects she had a credit card account that was\nplaced for collection for over $900.  She initially denied owing this account and suggested it may\nbe a fraudulent or incorrect entry on her credit report.   She latter indicated she contacted the creditor\nand received a balance owed, but provided no further information about the charges on the account\nor documents showing efforts to resolve it. \nApplicant attributed her financial problems to period of unemployment, underemployment,\nher health problems, and a serious injury her youngest son sustained in an automobile accident that\nrequires significant medical care.  Her budget reflects a net monthly remainder between $600 and\n$700, after deducting payments of over $500 toward the alleged student loans and $800 for\nentertainment and hobbies.  She submitted no documentation showing payments were made to\nresolve the three alleged student loans.  Her clients and coworkers praise her character and work\nperformance.  She experienced conditions beyond her control that contributed to her financial\nproblems.  However, she has refused to take responsibility for three student loans that she cosigned. \nAt one point, she indicated that she would not repay those loans.  She provided no documentation\nof her efforts to resolve them.  \u201cNotwithstanding the significant hardship and emotional toll\nsurrounding her son\u2019s vehicle accident, Applicant has not demonstrated that she has acted in a\nfinancially-responsible manner to address and resolve the delinquent accounts alleged in the SOR.\u201d \nDecision at 6.   \nDiscussion  \n2\n\nIn her appeal brief, Applicant states, \u201cI did not have an in person interview, none of my\nreferences were contacted, and the government [contractors] I worked for . . . 23 months were never\ninterviewed.  I believe if that had been done, the result would have been favorable.\u201d  Appeal Brief\nat 1.  Of note, she underwent a background interview with an investigator in November 2018.  File\nof Relevant Material (FORM) Item 5.  She is most likely referring to a hearing when she states she\ndid not have an in-person interview.  \nWhen she received the SOR, Applicant was provided a copy of the Directive and a form that\nadvised she could request a hearing or have her case decided on the written record.  Applicant chose\nthe latter option.  Department Counsel later prepared the FORM that was mailed to Applicant in\nOctober 2019.  The cover letter accompanying the FORM stated:\n[Department Counsel] has been assigned to present the Government\u2019s case\nand has prepared a [FORM] which will be submitted to an Administrative Judge to\nmake the determination in your case.  Before the FORM is sent to the Administrative\nJudge, you have an opportunity to review it, make any objections, and submit any\nadditional material you like the Administrative Judge to consider.   . . .  If you do not\nfile any objections or submit any additional information within 30 days of receipt of\nhis letter, your case will be assigned to an Administrative Judge for a determination\nbased solely upon the enclosed FORM.  [Emphasis added.]\nNeither the Judge nor Department Counsel have a duty to present mitigating evidence or to serve as\nan applicant\u2019s investigator.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-03062 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 11, 2015).  If\nApplicant wanted the Judge to consider additional matters, the burden was on her to present them. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15.  If she misunderstood the nature of her forum choice, the nature of the\nproceeding, or the responsibilities of the Judge or Department Counsel, the blame cannot fairly be\nplaced on DOHA or other DoD officials.  Applicant\u2019s assertions fail to establish that she was denied\nthe due process afforded her under the Directive.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-04472 at 3 (App. Bd.\nFeb. 9, 2017).  On the other hand, if Applicant is contending that she was denied due process because\nher clearance interview was conducted telephonically, we have no authority to rule on how security\nofficials conduct investigations.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-04186 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Oct. 28, 2015). \nApplicant highlights facts supporting the whole-person factors and argues she should be\ngranted a security clearance.    The presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the\nJudge to make a favorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh\nthe evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable\nevidence, or vice versa.  A party\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an\nability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the\nJudge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or\ncontrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-00650 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 27, 2016).  Applicant also\npoints out that she is required to have a clearance to work in her job even though she has no access\nto classified information.  Neither the impact of an adverse decision nor an individual\u2019s access to\nclassified material are relevant considerations in determining national security eligibility.  See, e.g.,\n3\n\nISCR Case No. 11-13180 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 21, 2013)(impact of an adverse decision) and  ISCR\nCase No. 18-02728 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 12, 2019)(access to classified information).\n \nApplicant has failed to establish the Judge committed any harmful errors.  The Judge\nexamined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision.  The\ndecision is sustainable on this record.  \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted only\nwhen \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d  Department of the Navy v.\nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro se\n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On July\n9, 2019, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing. \nOn February 20, 2020, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Carol G. Ricciardello denied\nApplicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28\nand E3.1.30. \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant had nine delinquent debts totaling about $27,400.  He denied\nall of the allegations in his SOR Response.  In her decision, the Judge noted that Applicant served\nin the military from 1981 to 1987 and has worked for defense contractors throughout his civilian\ncareer.  He encountered financial problems when he was unemployed for a four-month period in\n2014 and his mother passed away around that same time.  For the past 18 months, he has been\nearning an annual salary of about $120,000.  Before then, he earned about $80,000 annually.  He\nmaintains three residences, one of them belongs to his girlfriend to which he contributes about $3000\nper month and stays there about twice a week.  The Judge found that Applicant testified falsely when\nhe initially denied that one of the alleged debts was his responsibility but later admitted during\nquestioning it was his debt.  She ultimately found against him on all of the allegations.  She\nconcluded that Applicant has not made an effort to repay his delinquent debts, does not intend to pay\nmost of them, and is waiting until some are no longer on his credit report and potentially\nunenforceable due to the statute of limitations. \nAt the outset of his appeal brief, Applicant points out that he has been involved in protecting\nour country for years and takes umbrage that the Government would conclude an individual is\nuntrustworthy to be granted a security clearance because of his or her debts.  We construe this as an\nargument that his circumstances do not raise security concerns.  This argument lacks merit.  It is well\nestablished that financial problems can raise security concerns.  The concern under Guideline F is\nthat delinquent debts may cast doubt upon an applicant\u2019s judgment, self-control, and other\ncharacteristics essential to protecting national security information.     See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-\n06050 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Feb. 28, 2017).  In this case, the Judge\u2019s findings about Applicant\u2019s\ndelinquent debts, viewed in conjunction with his current substantial income, are sufficient to raise\nconcerns about his judgement and self-control, which, in turn, impugn his ability to protect classified\ninformation.  We find no reason to disturb the Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts\nraise disqualifying conditions under Guideline F.  Id.  \nApplicant\u2019s appeal brief raises due process issues.  He first contends that Department\nCounsel told him \u201cin an email before the hearing that these hearings are setup in a way people don\u2019t\nneed an attorney.  One will see real quit [sic] that wasn\u2019t true.  One might not have needed an\nattorney, but it might have kept the yelling down or if I would have at least brought my own\nwitness.\u201d  Appeal Brief at 1.  To the extent he may be contending that Department Counsel misled\nhim about the need to hire an attorney, we do not find that argument persuasive.  First, the email that\nApplicant is referencing is not in the record.  Second, Applicant consulted with and retained an\n2\n\nattorney to assist him in filing his SOR Response.  The attorney submitted Applicant\u2019s SOR\nResponse to the DoD Consolidated Adjudications Facility but did not represent him at the hearing. \nThird, the Judge asked Applicant if he was aware that he could have had an attorney \u201cor someone\nelse to assist\u201d him and he replied in the affirmative.  Tr. at 5-6.  Fourth, there is a rebuttable\npresumption that Federal officials and employees carry out their duties in good faith.  See, e.g, ISCR\nCase No. 03-21329 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 25, 2006).  A party seeking to rebut that presumption has\na heavy burden of persuasion on appeal.  Id.  Applicant has not met that heavy burden of establishing\nthat Department Counsel misled him in any manner. \nA central theme running throughout Applicant\u2019s appeal brief is that he was not provided a\nfair hearing.  This contention has two aspects.  First, he essentially claims the Judge was biased\nagainst him.  He repeatedly asserts that the Judge yelled at him, talked down to him, cut him off, did\nnot listen to him, put words in his mouth, badgered him, and did not read his exhibits before\nbecoming convinced the debts were his responsibility.   He states, \u201c . . . this Judge doesn\u2019t want to\nhear anything I have to say.  I think her mind was made up before I even came into the room . . . .\u201d \nand \u201c . . . I am not sure she has heard anything that I had to say what little it was, if she did hear it,\nshe just ignored it unless it was an answer she could use against me.\u201d  Appeal Brief at 8.  He also\nasserts the Judge teamed up with Department Counsel against him.  The second aspect of\nApplicant\u2019s contention raises another due process issue.  He contends that the Judge did not let him\ntalk at times during the hearing, implying he was not given a fair opportunity to testify.\nBias involves partiality for or against a party, predisposition to decide a case or issue without\nregard to the merits, or other indicia of a lack of impartiality.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 16-03451\nat 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 26, 2017).  There is a rebuttable presumption that a Judge is impartial and\nunbiased, and a party seeking to overcome that presumption has a heavy burden of persuasion.  Id. \nMoreover, \u201cexpressions of impatience, dissatisfaction, annoyance, even anger\u201d do not establish bias. \n\u201cA Judge\u2019s ordinary effort at courtroom administration\u2013even a stern and short-tempered Judge\u2019s\nordinary efforts at courtroom administration\u2013remain immune.\u201d  Liteky, et. al. v. United States, 510\nU.S. 540 at 555-556 (1994).\nWe have examined the entire record and decision, paying particular attention to the transcript\nof the hearing.  We find nothing therein to suggest that the Judge lacked impartiality or that she\nentered the hearing with an inflexible predisposition against Applicant.  She did not impede\nApplicant\u2019s presentation of his evidence, and her questioning appears to have been directed toward\nclarifying the record.  Of note, the Judge permitted Applicant to start testifying without interruption\nuntil he stopped.  Tr. at 23-29.  When he asked the Judge questions about how best to proceed, she\nresponded that he could proceed in any manner that he wanted.  Tr. at 23, 29, and 32.  Department\nCounsel did not begin her cross-examination until Applicant indicated that he had nothing further\nto present.  Tr. at 32.  During her cross-examination, Department Counsel allowed Applicant to\naddress the debts in the order in which wanted when he apparently became confused.  Tr. at 33-34. \nAt the end of the hearing, he was provided multiple opportunities to testify about any other matters\nthat he wished to address.  Tr. at 79, 81-82, and 86.  The transcript does not support Applicant\u2019s\nclaim of bias.  He has neither rebutted the presumption that the Judge was unbiased nor shown that\n3\n\nthe hearing was conducted in a manner the denied him a fair opportunity to testify.  He was provided\nthe due process that the Directive affords him.\nAs a related matter, Applicant notes that he reviewed some of the Judge\u2019s prior decisions and\nargues her decision in his case was \u201ca fill in the blank form letter she has used over and over so no\nwonder she didn\u2019t listen through half of the hearing.  She just had to fill in a few blanks and done. \nNot even an original document.\u201d  Appeal Brief at 8.  This argument is frivolous.  Applicant\u2019s brief \ndoes not identify any of the Judge\u2019s prior decisions that he is referencing.  An review of the decision\ndoes not support his claim.  In this case, the Judge, like other DOHA judges, followed a standard\nformat in drafting her decision.  However, from our review of the 13-page decision, the Judge\nspecifically tailored her findings of fact, analysis, conclusions, and whole-person assessment to the\nrecord evidence in this case.  As required by the Directive, this case was judged on its own merits. \nSee Directive, Encl 2, App. A \u00b6 2(b).  \nApplicant  argues that the evidence was not sufficient to support the Judge\u2019s decision.  In his\nappeal brief, he has made various assertions about his responsibility for the alleged debts, including\ninconsistent statements.  For example, he asserts the Government had no hard evidence to prove any\nof the debts were his responsibility and the credit reports offered into evidence were full of\ninaccuracies.  He notes the alleged debts were incurred more that five years ago and claims he has\nno memory of them.  He states that, when he disputed the debts, he was not convinced they were his\nresponsibility because some of the creditors failed to provide him with credit agreements that he\nsigned.  He also acknowledges, \u201cI have said all 9 of these debts in SOR are mine and I have said all\n9 of these debts in the SOR are not mine.\u201d  Appeal Brief at 12.\nIn her decision, the Judge noted that Applicant disclosed four of the alleged debts in his\nsecurity clearance application (SCA) and discussed others in his background interview.   The Judge\nfound:  \u201cAll of the delinquent debts alleged in the SOR are corroborated by Applicant\u2019s disclosures\nin his SCA; admissions made during his background interview; responses to interrogatories, his SOR\nanswer and exhibits  . . . ; credit reports . . . ; and Applicant\u2019s testimony.\u201d  Decision at 9.   From our\nreview of the record, the Judge\u2019s material findings and conclusions of a security concern are based\non substantial evidence or constitute reasonable inferences that could be drawn from the evidence. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-02225 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 25, 2019). \nIn his appeal brief, Applicant contends that the Judge gave insufficient weight to the\nmitigating evidence and did not consider evidence that he presented.  Based on our review of the\nrecord, his arguments are neither enough to rebut the presumption that the Judge considered all of\nthe evidence in the record nor sufficient to show that the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner\nthat was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-04856 at 2-3 (App.\nBd. Mar. 9, 2017).\nApplicant has failed to establish the Judge committed any harmful errors.  The Judge\nexamined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision.  The\ndecision is sustainable on this record.  \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted only\nwhen \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d  Department of the Navy v.\n4\n\nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).

Mendez, Esq., Deputy Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nLeon J. Schachter, Esq.\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On June\n26, 2019, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\n\ndecision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E\n(Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended)\n(Directive). Applicant requested a hearing.  On June 16, 2020, after the hearing, Defense Office of\nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge John Grattan Metz, Jr., denied Applicant\u2019s\nrequest for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge failed to issue a decision\nin a timely fashion; whether the Judge\u2019s findings of fact contained errors; whether the Judge erred\nby not addressing Applicant\u2019s request for a conditional grant of a clearance in accordance with\nDirective, Encl. 2, App. C; and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was arbitrary, capricious, or\ncontrary to law.  The Judge\u2019s favorable findings under Guideline E are not at issue in this appeal. \nConsistent with the following, we affirm the Judge\u2019s decision.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis\nThe Judge made the following findings pertinent to the issues raised on appeal: Applicant\u2019s\nSOR alleges two delinquent student loan accounts totaling over $238,000.  Applicant incurred these\ndebts while pursuing graduate studies from 1989 until 1995.  Applicant contended that he had made\npayments on these loans when the post-graduate grace period expired in the late 1990s.  However,\nbecause the size of his family grew along with attendant financial responsibilities, Applicant\nobtained deferments.  Although a collection agent began contacting him in 2014, Applicant took no\nsteps to repay.  His own children were by then in college, and he decided to pay their tuition so as\nnot to burden them with loans.  He paid their college expenses through his current income.\nWhen confronted with his delinquent loans during his 2018 clearance interview, Applicant\nstated an intent to make payment arrangements.  However, during a follow-on interview a few\nmonths later, he had not made contact with the creditor.  He finally reached out to the creditor in\nearly 2019 and began the process of rehabilitating the loans.  He entered into a rehabilitation plan\nabout a month later and made the required payments.  By the close of the record, Applicant was\nawaiting the details of a regular repayment plan, which might entail greater monthly payments than\nhe is currently making.  He claims to have the necessary income to pay the more than $237,000 that\nhe still owes on these loans and that, \u201cin a pinch,\u201d his assets are sufficient to resolve the debts in full. \nHis credit reports disclose no other financial problems.  Decision at 2.  \nApplicant submitted character references from two co-workers, a long-time friend, and his\noldest child.  Each of these references describe him as honest and trustworthy, and they all\nrecommend him for a clearance.  However, none of these persons disclosed knowledge of the\ngovernment\u2019s security concerns regarding Applicant\u2019s finances.\nThe Judge concluded that Applicant met none of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.  He\ncharacterized Applicant\u2019s education loans as recent because they are ongoing and stated that they\nwere not due to circumstances unlikely to recur.  He cited to evidence that Applicant prioritized his\nchildren\u2019s educational debts over paying off his own financial obligations, which was a circumstance\nwithin his control.  Applicant has had no financial counseling and his SOR debts are only \u201chalf-way\n2\n\nto being resolved.\u201d  Decision at 4.  Though noting Applicant\u2019s having made rehabilitation payments,\nthe Judge concluded that Applicant had not demonstrated a sufficient track record of debt resolution. \nHe reiterated his finding that none of Applicant\u2019s character references appeared to know about his\nsecurity-significant financial problems.  \nDiscussion\nApplicant argues that the Judge took over six months to issue his decision, which he contends\ndoes not comply with the requirements of Directive \u00b6 E3.1.25 that the Judge \u201cshall make a written\nclearance decision in a timely manner[.]\u201d He contends that had the Judge issued a timely decision,\nthe facts would have been clearer in his mind and he would not have made the other errors raised in\nhis appeal.  However, as Applicant himself notes, the Directive does not define the term \u201ctimely\nmanner.\u201d  Neither does it impose actual time standards on Judges.  Despite his claim that the Judge\nacted through faulty memory, Applicant does not articulate how his rights were actually impaired\nby the  the elapse of time between the hearing and the issuance of the decision.  Furthermore, the\nAppeal Board does not have supervisory authority over other DOHA personnel involved in\nprocessing security clearances.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-04097 at 2 (App. Bd.  Apr. 30, 2019). \nApplicant has not demonstrated that he was denied the due process rights afforded by the Directive. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-09421 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 2, 2018).\nApplicant contends that the Judge\u2019s findings of fact contained misstatements.  Among other\nthings, he takes issue with the Judge\u2019s finding that none of his character references knew about his\nsecurity-significant circumstances.  In fact, none of these references explicitly disclose knowledge\nof Applicant\u2019s delinquent financial loans.  Although it is possible that Applicant\u2019s daughter may\nhave been aware of his problems, given her close relationship to him, it is far from certain that such\nis the case.  After considering the record as a whole, we conclude that the Judge\u2019s material findings\nof security concern are supported by substantial evidence or constitute reasonable inferences that\ncould be drawn from the evidence.  Applicant has cited to no harmful error in the Judge\u2019s findings. \nSee, e.g. ISCR Case No. 18-02581 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 14, 2020). \nAt the close of the hearing, during final argument, Applicant requested that the Judge grant\nhim a conditional clearance in accordance with Directive, Encl. 2, App. C.  Tr. at 96.  Obviously,\nthe Judge did not act favorably upon this request, nor did he address it in his decision.  Applicant\nurges us to remand the case to the Judge for a new decision in which he presents his reasoning for\nnot granting a conditional clearance.  We note the Judge\u2019s analysis, which is consistent with the\nrecord that was before him.  The record evidence\u2013which includes Applicant\u2019s decision not to pay\nhis student loans over a course of years and the nearly $240,000 still owed despite Applicant\u2019s\napparent ability to pay\u2013supports a decision not to grant a conditional clearance.  Applicant has not\narticulated a persuasive reason for us to remand the Decision to the Judge.  On this issue, as well as\nin regard to his challenge to the Judge\u2019s mitigation analysis as a whole, Applicant is merely\nexpressing a disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, which is not enough to show\nthat the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 18-02581 at 4.            \n3\n\nThe Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the\ndecision.  The decision is sustainable on this record.  \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may\nbe granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d  Department\nof the Navy v.

His\narguments regarding the application of the mitigating conditions amount to a disagreement with the\nJudge\u2019s weighing of the evidence and are not sufficient to show that the Judge\u2019s conclusions are\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.

On July\n31, 2019, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On July\n23, 2020, after the hearing, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge\nRobert Tuider granted Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Department Counsel appealed\npursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nDepartment Counsel raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s favorable\ndecision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law because it failed to consider important aspects\nof the case and was unsupported by a reasonable reading of the record evidence as whole.  Consistent\nwith the following, we reverse.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact\nApplicant has held a security clearance since 2010.  The sole SOR allegation asserted that,\nfrom December 2016 to June 2019, Applicant was a member of a motorcycle club (Club A) through\nwhich he associated with persons involved in criminal activity.  Applicant\u2019s state (State A) defined\nClub A as a criminal street gang.  The Federal Government identified Club A as the official support\nclub of another motorcycle club (Club B), which State A defined as an \u201coutlaw motorcycle gang\u201d\n(OMG).  In responding to the SOR, Applicant admitted this allegation with an explanation.\nApplicant and four or five friends formed Club A, which was a local chapter of an existing\nmotorcycle club.  He affiliated with it because he enjoyed riding motorcycles and fraternizing with\nindividuals with the same interests.  At the time he joined Club A, he was not aware that law\nenforcement authorities considered it an OMG.  No evidence was submitted to establish that\nApplicant or any member of his local chapter of Club A engaged in any criminal activity.\nIn June 2018, local law enforcement authorities informed Applicant\u2019s Facility Security\nOfficer (FSO) that Applicant was member of Club A.  During an interview with the FSO, Applicant\nacknowledged being a member of Club A but denied engaging in any criminal activity.  The FSO\nadvised Applicant to disassociate with Club A because his continued membership could adversely\neffect his security clearance eligibility.\nIn May 2019, Applicant underwent a security clearance background interview.  As a result\nof that interview, Applicant had a better understanding of the Government\u2019s concerns arising from\nhis membership in Club A.  He advised the investigator that he needed to resign from Club A.\nIn June 2019, Applicant emailed the FSO advising that he had disassociated himself from\nClub A.  In early July 2019, Applicant\u2019s clearance was suspended, and he was placed on a leave of\nabsence.  The FSO requested that Applicant be allowed to return to work performing duties not\nrequiring a clearance.  The base commander approved that request.  Shortly thereafter, the SOR was\nissued. \n2\n\nAt the hearing, Department Counsel called a witness from a Federal agency who was an\nexpert on OMGs.  The expert witness \u201cprovided extensive testimony about Clubs A and B and\nmotorcycle clubs in general.  [He] did not have any knowledge of criminal activity of Club A in the\nstate where Applicant lived nor did he have any knowledge of Applicant personally being involved\nin any criminal activity.\u201d  [Decision at 4.]\nApplicant submitted character letters from coworkers, friends, and family members.  They\nattested to his dependability and good character.  They also asserted that Applicant was not a security\nrisk. \n  \nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis\nSecurity concerns in this case arise under Adjudicative Guideline (AG) \u00b6 16(d), \u201ccredible\nadverse information that is not explicitly covered under any other guideline and may not be sufficient\nby itself for an adverse determination, but which, when combined with all available information,\nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack\nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that\nthe individual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This includes, but is\nnot limited to, consideration of: (1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior . . . ;\u201d and AG \u00b6 16(g),\n\u201cassociation with persons involved in criminal activity.\u201d\n\u201cApplicant testified credibly that he was not aware that Club A was regarded as an OMG or\none engaged in criminal activity.  However, he was also on notice as of June 2018 that his ongoing \nmembership in Club A was a security concern, yet, at least for the time being, his membership\ncontinued.\u201d  Decision at 7.  While there is evidence that Clubs A and B participated in criminal\nactivity in other states, there is no evidence that Applicant or any members of his local chapter\nengaged in such activity.  It is noteworthy that, after Applicant was placed on a leave of absence, the\nbase commander approved a request for him to return to work performing duties not requiring a\nsecurity clearance.  Applicant\u2019s character evidence also deserves considerable weight.  In light of the\nrecord as a whole, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for\na security clearance.  \nDiscussion\nThere is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.  See\nDorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  The\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate admitted or\nproven facts.  The applicant has the burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable decision. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15.  The standard applicable in security clearance decisions \u201cis that a clearance may\nbe granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of\nthe Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for\n3\n\nnational security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  Directive, Encl. 2,\nApp. A \u00b6 2(b). \nIn deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are erroneous, we will review the\ndecision to determine whether:  it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a\nsatisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts found\nand the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of judgment; it fails\nto consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary\nto the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference of\nopinion.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-02563 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 28, 2015).    \nDepartment Counsel contends the Judge erred in failing to address adequately the key issue\nin this case, i.e., whether Applicant\u2019s association with individuals involved in criminal activity raised\nconcerns about his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.  This contention is persuasive.  She\nargues the Judge\u2019s decision primarily focused on the lack of evidence of Applicant engaging in\ncriminal activity but only perfunctorily addressed his association with members of Clubs A and B. \nIn her arguments, Department Counsel asserts the Judge failed to consider important\nevidence.  We agree and note the following evidence drawn from the record:\n1.  Club A is a nationwide club.  When he initially became a member of Club A,\nApplicant was aware of Club A\u2019s association with Club B.  He noted one of the\nfounding members of Club A reached out to a member of Club B and, through that\nassociation, Club A was established.  Tr. at 70 and 89-90 and Government Exhibit\n(GE) 3 at 7\n2.  The expert witness testified that local chapters of Club A did not have \u201cany type\nof mother chapter\u201d but instead report to the local chapter of Club B.  Tr. at 47-48. \n3. Upon being asked when he first realized Club B was considered an OMG,\nApplicant responded, \u201cI knew that [Club B was] considered that.\u201d  However, he\nindicated that he was not aware that Club A\u2019s affiliation with Club B would result in\nClub A being treated as an OMG.  Of specific interest was his remark, \u201cI did not\nknow that [Club A was] considered that because [Club A is] not a one-percenter club,\nso I was not aware that [Club A] would basically be treated as [Club B].1   Tr. at 75\nand GE 3 at 8.   \n4.  While a member of Club A, Applicant participated in club activities at least once\na week.  This included visiting out-of-town and out-of-state chapters.  He stated,\n1  \u201cThe American Motorcycle Association spokesman stated that 99 percent of the motorcycle public was\ncomprised of honest, law-abiding citizens, and that only one percent constituted troublemakers.  OMGs took pride in\nthe reference and adopted 1% as its symbol . . . .\u201d   GE 9 at 22.    \n4\n\n\u201cAnd the best way to get to know them is just to . . . see \u2018em -- do a visit, hang out --\nand then there\u2019s been time where I\u2019ve rode a thousand miles and then turned around\nthe next day and rode a thousand miles back.\u201d  Tr. at 72-73 and GE 3 at 7.\n5.  When asked whether he was ever aware of other members of Club A participating\nin criminal activity, Applicant testified, \u201cI was not, and that is one thing where -- I\nguess the best way to say it is if it\u2019s known that you are not someone who wants or\nis involved in any way or desire to make criminal activity, you don\u2019t get asked to\ncommit criminal activity.\u201d  Tr. at 73. \n6.  In addressing why he became a member of Club A, Applicant indicated he was\nnot lured into the club by criminal activity but stated, \u201cI do know and understand the\nhistory of motorcycle clubs and some of the bad things that have happened.\u201d  Tr. at\n69. \n7.  Applicant associated with members of Club B about once a month on average. \nTr. at 74. \n8.  When asked whether he was aware of any criminal activity perpetrated by Club\nB members, Applicant testified, \u201cMy only knowledge, to be honest, is things that you\nsee on , you know, documentaries -- Gangland, stuff like that -- but actual personal\nknowledge that I have been aware of that isn\u2019t public information, none.\u201d  Tr. at 74-\n75.   \n9.  Applicant did not disclose his association with Club A to his FSO until she \nconfronted him about it.   Tr. at 77 and GE 2 at 2.    \n10.  The expert witness testified that OMGs are sophisticated, hierarchical, military-\nstyle organizations that engaged in a wide variety of serious criminal activities.  Tr.\nat 25-26 and GE 6-9.  \n11.  The expert witness stated Clubs A and B were \u201cin cahoots together\u201d and Club\nA\u2019s \u201cprimary role is to do whatever they\u2019re told.\u201d  In describing chapters of Club A,\nhe stated, \u201cthey\u2019re definitely not a social club\u201d and \u201cadhere to whatever rules are\nbrought down by [Club B] on them.\u201d  In general, he noted that members of Club A\nengage in criminal activity for or with members of Club B.  Tr. at 39-40, 47-49.\n12.  The expert witness stated a support club is a \u201cfeeder system\u201d for recruiting\nmembers into the dominant club.  Support clubs usually wear the same color scheme\nas the dominant club and wear tabs and patches showing support of the dominant\nclub.  Tr. at 37-40.\n5\n\n13.  Applicant testified that he did not aspire to become a member of Club B\n\u201cbecause [he] knew of the potential issues that it could have with [his] job.\u201d  Tr. at\n92-93.\n  \n14.  While no longer is a member of Club A, Applicant testified that he still\noccasionally associates with members of Club A.  He noted that it was hard not to\nrun into them in their town.  They have mutual friends and sometimes they met at a\nkid\u2019s birthday party.  Tr. at 85-86.\n \nThe Judge erred in failing to address this evidence that undercuts his mitigation analysis.  A security\nclearance decision must be based not just on the favorable evidence but on consideration of the\nevidence as a whole.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 94-1109 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 31, 1996).  \nThe above listed evidence establishes that Applicant was aware when he became a member\nof Club A that it was affiliated with Club B; that he knew Club B was an OMG; that he understood\nthe history of motorcycle clubs; that he had a generalized knowledge of Club B\u2019s criminal activities;\nthat he knew of \u201csome of the bad things that have happened[;]\u201d that he participated weekly  in Club\nA activities and associated monthly with Club B members; and that he visited other chapters of these\nclubs, including in other states.  Applicant knew that becoming a member of Club B could\npotentially cause him to lose his job, yet he continued to associate routinely with members of that\nclub.  Additionally, as Department Counsel highlights, Applicant\u2019s statement \u201cif it\u2019s known that you\nare not someone who wants or is involved in any way or desire to make criminal activity, you don\u2019t\nget asked to commit criminal activity\u201d shows he was aware that these clubs were involved in\ncriminal activity because otherwise he would not have had the knowledge needed to make such a\nstatement.  This latter statement also undermines the Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant testified\ncredibly he was not aware of Club A was engaged in criminal activity.  In short, Applicant\u2019s\nassociation with members of Clubs A and B raised security concerns about his judgment, reliability,\nand trustworthiness that the Judge did not adequately address.  \nFor about 17 months, Applicant associated with individuals involved in criminal activity\nwithout notifying his FSO.  Even after his FSO confronted him, placed him on notice that his\nmembership in Club A created potential security concerns, and advised him to disassociate with that\nclub in June 2018, Applicant continued his membership in that club for another year.  It was only\nafter his background interview in May 2019, when he purportedly realized his continued membership\nplaced his security clearance and job in jeopardy, that he disassociated himself from the club in June\n2019.  As the Appeal Board has previously stated, the timing of an applicant\u2019s corrective action is\na relevant factor to consider in evaluating its mitigative value.  An applicant who takes action to\nresolve security concerns only after having been placed on notice that his or her clearance is in\njeopardy may lack the judgment and willingness to follow rules and regulations when his or her\npersonal interests are not threatened.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01256 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 3,\n2018).  At the time the record close, Applicant had only disassociated himself from Club A for\napproximately seven months and still continued to have some contact with its members.   \n6\n\nBased on our review of the record, we conclude that the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary and\ncapricious because it fails to consider important aspects of the case and runs contrary to the weight\nof the record evidence.  The Judge\u2019s decision is not sustainable.  Furthermore, we conclude that the\nrecord evidence, viewed as a whole, is not sufficient to mitigate the Government\u2019s security concerns\nunder the Egan standard.\n7\n\nOrder\nThe Decision is REVERSED.  \nSigned: Michael Y.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro se\n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On  \nJuly 3, 2019, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a decision\non the written record.  On January 9, 2020, after considering the record, Defense Office of Hearings\nand Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Noreen Lynch denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security\nclearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in her findings of\nfact; whether the Judge\u2019s whole-person analysis was erroneous; and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse\ndecision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we affirm.  \nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis\nApplicant is divorced and remarried, with four children.  He has worked for his current\nemployer since 1995 and has held a security clearance since 2010.  Applicant\u2019s SOR contained one\nallegation: that he failed to file, as required, Federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2016,\n2017, and 2018.  Applicant admitted that he was late in requesting extensions for filing his tax\nreturns.  He provided proof of filing his tax returns for the years in question1 and stated that he was\nnot a good bookkeeper.  In addition to the above, Applicant owed over $45,000 in back taxes for\n2016, but he has satisfied this debt.\nThe Judge concluded that Applicant had not provided a sufficient explanation for his\nsecurity-significant conduct.  In the whole-person analysis, she noted Applicant\u2019s employment status\nand his having held a clearance for several years.  However, she also noted that he had filed his\ndelinquent returns in 2019.  The Judge concluded that Applicant had not met his burden of\npersuasion regarding mitigation.\nDiscussion\nApplicant challenges some of the Judge\u2019s findings of fact.  For example, he cites to evidence\nthat his first marriage ended with the passing of his wife rather than divorce; that he has three rather\nthan four living children; that he has worked for his current employer since 2017 rather than 1995;\nand that he filed requests for extensions.  \nAlthough his appeal brief includes matters from outside the record that we cannot consider\n(Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29), the evidence within the record supports Applicant\u2019s arguments concerning his\nfamily circumstances, employment history, and his having held a clearance prior to 2010.  We note\nApplicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, in which he stated that he had requested filing extensions. \nHowever, there is nothing in the record or in Applicant\u2019s appeal submission that would show that\nhe had filed his returns on time, which is the gravamen of the case.  Considering Applicant\u2019s\n1Applicant\u2019s Response to the SOR shows that these returns were filed in 2019.  \n2\n\narguments as a whole, we find no error that would have affected the outcome of the decision. \nTherefore, any such errors are harmless.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 18-02581 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 14,\n2020).  We conclude that the Judge\u2019s material findings are supported by substantial evidence or\nconstitute reasonable inferences that could be derived from the evidence.  Id.  Moreover, we\nconclude that the Judge\u2019s whole person analysis complies with the requirements of Directive \u00b6 6.3,\nin that she considered the totality of the evidence in reaching her decision.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No.\n18-02925 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 15, 2020). \n  \nThe record supports a conclusion that the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated\na satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found\nand the choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations, such as filing tax returns\nwhen due, does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of those\ngranted access to classified information.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01256 at 3 (App. Bd.

The\nJudge concluded that most of Applicant\u2019s debts have remained unresolved for several years, that he\nonly recently took steps to resolve them, and that he did not establish a sufficient track record of\npayments towards his past-due debts.\nIn his appeal brief, Applicant states he is challenging the Judge\u2019s findings of fact but does\nnot identify any specific finding that he is disputing.  Instead, his arguments amount to a\ndisagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence.   He contends, for example,  that he has no\ncriminal record, that unemployment contributed to his financial problems, that all his negative credit\nentries are years old, that he has a 91% on-time payment history, and that he received credit\ncounseling advice to bring all active account current before addressing closed accounts.  He argues\nthat he has established a sufficient track record of making payments on his debts.   The Judge\naddressed many of these matters in his decision.  In essence, Applicant is advocating for an\nalternative weighing of the evidence.  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the\nevidence or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence is not sufficient to\ndemonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro se\n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On July\n26, 2019, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse)\nand Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On January 31, 2020, after the hearing,\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Braden M. Murphy denied\nApplicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28\nand E3.1.30.\nThe Judge summarized the case as follows:\nApplicant has a 20-year history of marijuana use, and he used marijuana after\nsubmitting his security clearance application.  Security concerns under Guideline H,\ndrug involvement and substance misuse, are not mitigated.  Applicant\u2019s 2007 arrest\nfor marijuana possession is dated, but mitigation of the security concern under\nGuideline J, criminal conduct, is not established, due to his subsequent marijuana\nuse.  Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  [Decision\nat 1.]\nIn his appeal brief, Applicant claims that, before the hearing, Department Counsel stated he\nattempted to have the case dismissed because the security concerns appeared to have been mitigated. \nBased on that purported communication, Applicant argues that he believes another Judge would have\nreached a favorable decision.  In his reply brief, Department Counsel argues this purported\ncommunication constitutes new evidence and does not raise any due process issues.  More\nspecifically, Department Counsel states, \u201c[Applicant] does not allege or raise a concern that he was\ndenied any opportunity to present his case or was otherwise harmed.\u201d  Reply Brief at 2.  We agree\nwith Department Counsel.  Neither party discussed or raised the purported communication at the\nhearing.  Nothing in that communication would likely have misled a reasonable person in any\nmanner or would have caused him to take any action or make any decision that would have inured\nto his detriment.  Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29, we are prohibited from considering this purported\ncommunication on appeal because it is new evidence.  This claim is not reviewable.  \nIn his appeal brief, Applicant cites to the Adjudicative Desk Reference (ADR) in support of\nhis arguments that his alleged conduct has been mitigated.  His reliance upon the ADR is misplaced. \nDOHA Judges are required to decide cases by using the Adjudicative Guidelines, not the ADR.  The\nADR itself contains language indicating that it is not U.S. Government policy and may not be cited\nas authority for denial or revocation of access to classified information.  See ADR at 2, Approving\nAuthority Paragraph.  See also ISCR Case No. 07-02253 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 28, 2008).\nApplicant disputes the allegation asserting that he was arrested for possession of marijuana\nin 2007.  He argues there is no evidence he committed that offense and cites to the written statement\nof an eyewitness that corroborates his claim that he did not possess marijuana on that occasion.  In\n2\n\nhis security clearance application (SCA) submitted in 2016, Applicant disclosed that he was arrested\nfor being near some people smoking marijuana in 2007, and the misdemeanor \u201cpossession?\u201d charge\nwas dropped.  Government Exhibit (GE) 1 at 68 and 69.   He also disclosed that he used marijuana\non occasion from 1997 to 2016, including \u201crecreational use, daily use from 1997 until 2000, now\nmonthly or less, used \u223c2000 times[.]\u201d  Id. at 70.  In his background interview, he told an investigator\nthat he was in the back of a van when fellow band members in its front were smoking marijuana. \nWhen a police officer arrested him, he told the officer that he was not involved in smoking\nmarijuana.  He was held in jail overnight.  The next day he met with a court-appointed attorney who\nadvised him, if he pled \u201cno contest\u201d to the charge, he would not need to return to court.  He pled no\ncontest to the charge and was placed on one year of unsupervised probation.1  He was told that, after\nhis probation was completed, the charge would be dismissed.  GE 2 at 5.  The only evidence of the\narrest in the record are the statements of Applicant and the eyewitness.  See also Tr. 33-37 and 73-76.\nIn his analysis, the Judge notes that Applicant disputed the arrest allegation, pled no contest\nto the charge, and chose not to contest the charge which would have required him to return to a city\nfar from his home.  The Judge concluded that \u201cthe fact of the arrest is sufficient to apply AG \u00b6\n31(b).\u201d2  Decision at 8.  It merits noting that a Judge is tasked to resolve apparent conflicts in the\nevidence.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-00281 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 30, 2014).  A Judge\u2019s decision\nalso must be written in a manner that allows the parties and the Board to discern what conclusions\nthe Judge is reaching.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 16-02536 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 23, 2018).  Here, the\nJudge did not specifically conclude that Applicant committed the criminal conduct at issue or that\nApplicant\u2019s denial of engaging in that conduct was not credible.   We are unable to determine, as the\ndecision is written, whether the Judge concluded Applicant possessed marijuana when he was\narrested in 2007. \nIn the past, we have stated, \u201c[t]he fact that an applicant has been arrested or otherwise\ncharged with a criminal offense, standing alone, does not constitute proof that the applicant engaged\nin criminal conduct.\u201d  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 99-0119 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 13, 1999).  When that\ndecision was issued, the Guideline J disqualifying conditions were different than they are today.  At\nthe time of that prior decision, the pertinent Guideline J disqualifying conditions read:\nE2.A10.1.2.1.  Allegations or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether\nthe person was formally charged;\nE2.A10.2.2.  A single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses.\nThe applicable disqualifying condition now reads:\n1 See ISCR Case No. 04-05712 (App.  Bd. Oct. 31, 2006)(addressing a Judge\u2019s erroneous application of the\ndoctrine of collateral estoppel to a misdemeanor conviction).\n2  AG \u00b6 31(b) states, \u201cevidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an admission, and matters\nof official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or\nconvicted[.]\u201d  Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6 31(b).  \n3\n\n31(b)   evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an admission,\nand matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the\nindividual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted[.]\nWe have previously recognized that the precedential value of our decisions may be affected by\nchanges to the Directive or the Guidelines.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01807 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Mar.\n7, 2018).  We also are aware that an arrest must be based on probable cause that a criminal offense\nhas been or is being committed.3  Having said that, all record evidence pertaining to an arrest should\nbe analyzed in determining whether AG \u00b6 31(b) is established.  \nAs noted above, the Judge did not specifically address whether Applicant\u2019s denial of\npossessing marijuana at the time of his arrest was credible.  Given Applicant\u2019s apparent\ncomprehensive disclosure of his other drug involvement and the statement of the eyewitness, his\ncredibility was a relevant factor that should have been addressed.  Although such an omission may\nhave been an error, it was harmless because it did not likely affect the outcome of the case.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No 11-15184 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 25, 2013).  The unmitigated security concerns under\nGuideline H are sufficient support the Judge\u2019s ultimate decision.  \nApplicant also argues that the Judge erred in his whole-person assessment and challenges his\nconclusion that Applicant needed to establish a longer track record of abstinence from illegal drug\nuse.  A party\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a\ndifferent interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the\nevidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 15-00650 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 27, 2016).  Applicant has failed to show that the\nJudge erred in his whole-person assessment.\n \nThe Judge examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the\ndecision.  The decision is sustainable on this record.  \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may\nbe granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d  Department\nof the Navy v.

On\nDecember 13, 2019, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for\nthat decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline\nG (Alcohol Consumption) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended)\n(Directive).  Applicant requested a decision on the written record.  On August 18, 2020, after\nconsidering the record, Administrative Judge John Bayard Glendon denied Applicant\u2019s request for\na security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nThe Judge summarized the case as follows:\nThe original SOR alleges that Applicant has 24 delinquent debts totaling over\n$1,000,000.  Department Counsel amended the SOR by adding two additional debts\ntotaling about $50,000.  The SOR also alleges Applicant was twice arrested for\ndriving under the influence of alcohol within a nine-month period in 2014 and 2015. \nApplicant provided substantial evidence to mitigate the Guideline G security\nconcerns alleged in the SOR, but he provided insufficient mitigation evidence\nregarding the Guideline F allegations.  Accordingly, national security eligibility for\naccess to classified information is denied.  [Decision at 1.]\nIn his analysis, the Judge noted that, even though Applicant expressed a commitment to pay all of\nhis debts, he had limited financial resources due to his large child support obligations and failed to\nmeet his burden to submit evidence demonstrating his plans to repay numerous delinquent debts.  \n \nIn his appeal brief, Applicant notes that his financial problems arose from a business failure\nand highlights his efforts to resolve the alleged debts.  He argues that he has provided sufficient\nevidence to mitigate any security concerns arising from his debts.  In essence, he is advocating for\nan alternative weighing of the evidence.  A party\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the\nevidence or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence is not sufficient to\ndemonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.

Applicant\nrequested a decision on the written record.  On December 11, 2019, after considering the record,\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Juan J. Rivera denied\nApplicant\u2019s request for a trustworthiness designation.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 \nE3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge was biased against her\nand whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent\nwith the following, we affirm.   \nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis\nApplicant has worked for different employers between 2004 and 2018, when she began her\ncurrent job.  This is her first effort to obtain a trustworthiness designation.  Her SOR alleged\nnumerous delinquent debts, for auto loans, a credit card account, telecommunication services, and\na debt for medical services.  The Judge resolved two of these debts\u2013the medical account and one\ntelecommunication services debt\u2013in her favor.  However, he found that she had not demonstrated\nresolution of the remaining allegations, which total $26,000.  He cited to Applicant\u2019s promises to\naddress some debts in the future as well as her claim that she does not intend to resolve others\nbecause they are not listed on her credit report as reasons for entering adverse findings.   \nApplicant attributed her financial troubles to a diminution in pay when she took a job in a\ndifferent state, medical expenses, and a five-month period of unemployment/underemployment when\nshe experienced a leg injury and complications with a pregnancy.  Applicant presented no\ndocumentary evidence about her current financial situation, a budget, or whether she has participated\nin financial counseling.\nThough noting that Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties were affected by circumstances that\nwere outside her control, the Judge concluded that she had not demonstrated responsible action.  He\ncited to his finding that Applicant had presented no evidence about her current financial condition\nand concluded that her having resolved two accounts (after receipt of the SOR) was not sufficient\nto establish a track record of debt payment.\nDiscussion\nApplicant argues that the Judge was biased against her.  She contends that the Judge\ncharacterized her as someone who intentionally did not pay her debts, which was inaccurate.  A\nJudge is presumed to be unbiased, and a party who argues otherwise has a heavy burden of\npersuasion.  See, e.g., ADP Case No. 07-00966 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 24, 2009).  We have examined\n2\n\nthe Decision in light of the record as a whole and find nothing that would likely convince reasonable\nperson that the Judge lacked the requisite impartiality.  Applicant has not met her heavy burden of\npersuasion on this issue.\nApplicant\u2019s brief includes matters from outside the record, which we cannot consider. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.29.  She cites to the Judge\u2019s finding that she had not submitted evidence regarding\nher current finances, etc.  She states that she would have provided such evidence if she had been\nrequested to do so.  We note that the File of Relevant Material (FORM) provided Applicant guidance\nas to her right to submit a documentary response to its contents, and the cover letter accompanying\nthe FORM contained similar information.  Letter to Applicant, dated September 20, 2019. \nMoreover, Applicant\u2019s brief cites explicitly to the provisions of the Directive that placed upon her\nthe burden of persuasion as to mitigation, suggesting that she was generally aware of her rights and\nresponsibilities.  Appeal Brief at 1-2; Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.14 and 15.  We find nothing in the record\nto demonstrate that Applicant was not adequately apprised of her duty to present evidence in\nmitigation or that she failed to understand the nature of that duty.  To the extent that she is arguing\nthat she did not receive the due process afforded by the Directive, we resolve this issue adversely to\nher.  See ADP Case No. 15-07882 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 7, 2017).  \nApplicant contends that the summary of her clearance interview distorted her answers and\npainted her as irresponsible.  Department Counsel advised her of her opportunity of comment on the\naccuracy of the summary and make corrections as appropriate.  FORM at 2.  Despite this guidance\nto Applicant, her Response to the FORM included no reference to her interview summary.  Her\nargument on appeal supplies no reason for us to conclude that the Judge erred in his treatment of this\nevidence.\nThe balance of Applicant\u2019s arguments consists of a challenge to the manner in which the\nJudge weighed the evidence.  Disagreement with a Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence or an ability\nto argue for a different interpretation of the record is not sufficient to show that the Judge weighed\nthe evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. \nSee, e.g., ADP Case 18-00166 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2018).   \nThe record supports a conclusion that the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated\na satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found\nand the choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro se\n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On July\n31, 2019, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing. \nOn July 16, 2020, after the hearing, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nAdministrative Judge Robert Tuider denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant\nappealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we affirm.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis\nApplicant, who is in his 50s, is married with two adult children.  He has a bachelor\u2019s degree. \nHe served in the U.S. military for 30 years, including a combat tour in Iraq, and was honorably\ndischarged.  Since then, he has worked for defense contractors.  He has held a security clearance for\nmany years. \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant had one delinquent debt, i.e., a second mortgage past-due\nfor about $42,700 with a total balance of over $132,000.  This debt arose from a home Applicant\npurchased for about $587,000 with two adjustable rate mortgages in the mid-2000s.  After the\nhousing market collapse in 2008, the market value of the home was less than the balance of the\noutstanding mortgages.   By 2013, Applicant\u2019s equity in the home rebounded somewhat but not to\nthe point that he could refinance or sell it.   \nIn 2013, Applicant purchased a second home for about $500,000 with a fixed mortgage.  He\nplanned to rent the first home until it regained sufficient equity so that he could sell it.  However, he\nwas unable to sustain ownership of the first home due to increases in the adjustable rate mortgages. \nHe worked with  a realtor and original lender to sell it through a short sale.  After those efforts were\nunsuccessful, the original lender eventually sold the two mortgages to separate lenders in 2016 and\n2017.  The new first-mortgage holder rejected three short sale offers, foreclosed on the home, sold\nit at a trustee sale, forgave the debt on the first mortgage, and issued Applicant an IRS Form 1099A,\nAcquisition or Abandonment of Secured Property.  \nThe new second-mortgage holder has not forgiven that debt and continues to pursue\ncollection efforts.  In responding to the SOR, Applicant indicated he was in the process of hiring a\nreal estate lawyer to assist him in addressing this debt.   He has continued to communicate with the\nsecond-mortgage holder who charged off the debt, which terminated the accrual of additional interest\nor late fees.  In February 2020, this mortgage holder offered to settle the outstanding balance of about\n$135,000 for about $20,300.  Applicant had concerns about the offer and wanted to obtain legal\nadvice to understand his options.  At the time of the hearing in late February 2020, he had not\n2\n\nconsulted with counsel but indicated he still intended to do so.  He stated that, if the second mortgage\nwas determined to be a valid debt, he was in a position to resolve it.  \nAt the hearing, the Judge advised Applicant that he had not mitigated the security concerns\narising from this debt.  The record of the proceeding was left open for a month for Applicant to\nsubmit additional matters.  The day before the record was scheduled to close, Applicant submitted\nan email indicating he consulted with an attorney who advised he was unable to help him.  Applicant\nalso indicated the second-mortgage holder was now willing to settle the debt for $13,520, but he\ninformed the lender that amount was still too high.  The Judge responded by offering to leave the\nrecord open for another month.  Applicant accepted the Judge\u2019s offer to leave the record open but\ndid not submit anything further. \nApplicant submitted character evidence showing he is top-level performer.  He also stated\nthat he has always taken his responsibility to safeguard classified information very seriously, and he\nwould never do anything to jeopardize such information or national security.  \nNone of the mitigating conditions fully apply.  Applicant\u2019s service and loyalty to the United\nStates are not at issue in this case.  The Judge noted that Applicant\u2019s distinguished career in the\nmilitary and with defense contractors \u201cwould normally tilt the scale in his favor on a close case.\u201d \nDecision at 9.  After first noting that Applicant\u2019s problems with the second mortgage can be traced\nback to the housing market collapse in 2008 and that he has made several attempts to resolve this\ndebt, the Judge concluded Applicant has been unable or unwilling to reach a settlement of that debt\ndespite his assurance that he had the means to resolve it.  The Judge found against Applicant on the\nalleged debt.  \n \nDiscussion\nApplicant contends that the Judge\u2019s decision is flawed because it places undue weight on \u201cthe\nonetime occurrence of a financial debt due to a home foreclosure, as a direct result of the 2008\nhousing market collapse[,]\u201d and it did not fully take into consideration his whole-person evidence. \nAppeal Brief at 1.  In his arguments, he highlights his \u201cimpeccable character\u201d and notes he has no\nother financial problems.  Id.  The Judge\u2019s findings and conclusions essentially addressed the matters\nthat Applicant is raising on appeal.  Applicant\u2019s arguments amount to a disagreement with the\nJudge\u2019s weighing of the evidence and are not enough to show that the Judge\u2019s analysis or\nconclusions were arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 18-02239 at 3\n(App. Bd. Jul. 20, 2020).  \nIn his brief, Applicant also argues the investigating officer who conducted his background\ninterview indicated he did not pose a threat to national security.  The investigating officer\u2019s\ncomments, however, summarize Applicant\u2019s answers during the interview.  They do not constitute\nthe investigating officer\u2019s considered opinion as to Applicant\u2019s worthiness for a clearance.  In any\nevent, even if an investigator provided such an opinion, it would not bind the DoD in its evaluation\nof an applicant\u2019s case.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-03069 at 3 (App. Bd.

Mendez, Esq., Deputy Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro se\n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On\nAugust 14, 2019, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a decision\non the written record.  On June 15, 2020, after considering the record, Administrative Judge Eric H.\nBorgstrom  denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nApplicant\u2019s appeal brief contains matters from outside the record, which we are generally\nprecluded from considering.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.  However, we have previously considered new\nevidence when examining threshold issues, such as due process or jurisdiction.  See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 14-00812 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 8, 2015).\nOn December 11, 2019, Department Counsel sent Applicant a copy of the File of Relevant\nMaterial (FORM).  On December 19, 2019, Applicant signed a document acknowledging receipt of\nthe FORM.  He was given 30 days from its receipt to submit additional matters to a specified\nindividual at DOHA.  His response was due on January 18, 2020.  On April 15, 2020, a DOHA\nmemorandum was issued requesting the assignment of a Judge to the case.  The memorandum notes\nthat Applicant did not submit a response to the FORM within the allotted time period and that the\ncase file is now complete and ready for consideration.  In his brief, Applicant states:\nMy only argument about the ruling is I do not believe the Judge was presented with\nall the evidence that was provided to [the name of the adjudicator who issued the\nSOR].  I talked to her on the phone on 30 Jan 2020 about my case, and during the\nconversation I explained to her that my 2017 taxes were already filed, and I would\nsend her the supporting document proving that, which I did by email on 30 Jan 2020. \n[Appeal Brief at 2.]\nThe documents attached to Applicant\u2019s appeal brief predate his purported submission to the\nadjudicator.  He also indicated the adjudicator never responded to his email, and he interpreted the\nlack of response to mean she did not require any further supporting documentation. \nBased on the above, it appears Applicant may have submitted to the adjudicator an untimely\nresponse to the FORM before the case was presented to the Judge for consideration.  If so,\nDepartment Counsel and the Judge should have been provided Applicant\u2019s FORM response. \nDepartment Counsel should then have had an opportunity to object, in whole or in part, to\nApplicant\u2019s FORM Response, and the Judge should have had an opportunity to rule on any\nobjections.  If such events had occurred, it is possible that Applicant\u2019s FORM response may have\nbeen considered by the Judge in rendering his decision.      \nGiven these circumstances, we conclude the best solution is to remand the case.   The Judge\nis instructed to reopen the record and, working with the parties, determine whether Applicant\nsubmitted a FORM Response before the case was submitted to him.  If Applicant made such an\nsubmission, the Judge should provide Department Counsel an opportunity to object to the\n2\n\nsubmission and then rule on any objections.  The Judge should issue a new decision in accordance\nwith Directive \u00b6 E3.1.35.\n3\n\nOrder\nThe Decision is REMANDED.  \nSigned: Michael Ra\u2019anan           \nMichael Ra\u2019anan\nAdministrative Judge\nChairperson, Appeal Board\nSigned: James E.

Applicant appealed\npursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant failed to file, as required, his Federal income tax returns for \n2014, 2015, 2017, and 2018; that he owed Federal taxes for 2014 through 2018 totaling about\n$15,000; and that he had six other delinquent debts totaling over $6,000.   Noting that Applicant\nprovided copies of the Federal tax returns for the years in question (two undated), the Judge\nconcluded those tax returns were not filed in a timely manner.  Applicant resolved two of the alleged\ndebts (a bank account and automobile loan) totaling about $1,500 but failed to provided adequate\ndocumentation showing the other debts have been sufficiently addressed.   The Judge found in favor\nof Applicant on the two resolved debts and against him on the other allegations.    \nApplicant\u2019s appeal brief contains documents and assertions that are not included in the\nrecord.  Some of the documents postdate the Judge\u2019s decision.  The Appeal Board is prohibited from\nconsidering new evidence on appeal.

For example, he asserts that\nstatements he made about his employment status were not noted in the interview summary.  He also \ncontends that, if a more thorough background investigation had been conducted, it would have\nshowed his willingness to correct his financial responsibilities.

See, e.g., ISCR Case No\n19-01220 at 3 (App. Bd.

On\nAugust 28, 2019, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) of Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a decision on the\nwritten record.  On May 21, 2020, after considering the record, Administrative Judge Richard A.\nCefola  denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive\n\u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in the findings of\nfact and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. \nConsistent with the following, we affirm.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis\nApplicant, who is in his 60s, fled the Soviet Union nearly 30 years ago.  His father, sister,\nand two children from a former marriage are citizens and residents of Russia.  He last saw his father\nabout 16 years ago, has little contact with his sister, and has not seen his Russian children in more\nthan 30 years.  He is now married to a U.S. citizen, and they have two children who were born in the\nUnited States.\nApplicant has two friends who are citizens and residents of Russia but has had little or no\ncontact with them in the past four to six years.  He has two \u201cassociate(s)\u201d who are citizens and\nresidents of Russia.  Decision at 3.  The associates are \u201cemployed by the Russian government\u201d in\nhigh-level positions.  Id.  He communicates with the two associates about once every one to two\nyears with the last time being in 2017.  The two associates clearly pose a potential for improper\nforeign influence.  \nRussia uses cyber-operations to collect intelligence and sensitive U.S. business and\ntechnology information.  Russia appears to be a significant threat to U.S. national security.   \nThe Judge\u2019s mitigation analysis consisted of the following:\nAs noted above in my Findings of Fact, Applicant\u2019s high-placed Russian\nassociates pose a significant Foreign Influence threat to our national security. \nAlthough he Skypes them only about \u201c1 time every 1to 2 years,\u201d the threat is clearly\nthere.  Foreign Influence is found against Applicant. [Decision at 5.]\nDiscussion\nAs noted above, the Judge found Applicant\u2019s associates were \u201cemployed by the Russian\ngovernment.\u201d  In his appeal brief, Applicant contends that Judge relied on outdated information\nregarding one of his Russian associates, noting the associate had retired.  In this regard, we note that\nApplicant amended his personal subject interview with a comment that the Russian associate \u201cretired\naround November of 2017.\u201d  Government Exhibit 3, Interrogatories, at 3.  In light of this\n2\n\namendment, the Judge erred in finding one of the associates was employed by the Russian\nGovernment.  \nWhile we recognize that the Judge\u2019s analysis of the Guideline B security concerns focused\nalmost exclusively on Applicant\u2019s contacts with the two Russian Government officials, we conclude\nhis error regarding the employment status of one of them was a harmless.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No\n11-15184 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 25, 2013) (An error is harmless if it did not likely affect the outcome\nof the case).  It is reasonable to conclude that the retired high-level government official still has\ncontact with other high-level Russian Government officials.  Moreover, Applicant\u2019s other associate\nremains a high-level Russian Government official.  In light of the significant threat that Russia poses\nto U.S. national security, Applicant\u2019s contact with the remaining high-level Russian Government\nofficial is a sufficient basis for concluding the security concerns arising from that contact are not\nmitigated.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-00831 at 4-6 (App. Bd. Jul. 29, 2020)(applying the \u201cvery\nheavy burden of persuasion\u201d to an applicant with family members in Russia because it is viewed as\nhostile to the United States for the purpose of DOHA adjudications).\nIn his appeal brief, Applicant makes arguments that are based on matters from outside the\nrecord, which we are precluded from considering.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.  Applicant argues that the\nJudge\u2019s decision \u201cis based on the fact that I was born in Russia as [sic] therefore I could be a Russian\nspy because of that.\u201d  Appeal Brief at 2.  There is nothing in the Judge\u2019s decision that support that\nargument.  The Judge\u2019s decision, the SOR, and the File of Relevant Material (FORM), are about\nApplicant\u2019s contacts in Russia.  He also argues that his foreign contacts cannot be considered a threat\nto U.S. national security and highlights circumstances in his life that weigh in his favor.  His\narguments consist of nothing more than a disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence,\nwhich is not enough to show that the Judge\u2019s analysis was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 18-02239 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 20, 2020).

On his 2017 tax return, Applicant claimed that he lived overseas for the entire tax year in\nquestion.  However, in fact he returned to the U.S. and has lived here continuously since March\n2017.  \nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis\nThe timing of Applicant\u2019s steps to resolve his tax delinquencies\u2013after he received the SOR\nand the FORM\u2013does not support a conclusion that he engaged in a good-faith effort to resolve his\nfinancial obligations.  Applicant\u2019s claim that he was not aware of his obligation to file the returns\ndoes not support a conclusion that he acted responsibly.  The Judge cited to the non-alleged tax\ndelinquencies for 2009 and 2018, observing that she had considered them on the issue of mitigation\nand not as independent security concerns.  She found that Applicant\u2019s tax delinquencies have been\nongoing for years and that he had provided \u201cdiscrepant information\u201d about his returns in his security\nclearance application, clearance interview, SOR Answer, and FORM Response.  \n1The Decision is undated.  The DOHA cover letter to Applicant that accompanied the Decision was dated\nFebruary 5, 2020. \n2\n\nDiscussion\nOn appeal Applicant contends for the first time that he was entitled to filing extensions due\nto his continued service in a combat zone.  The crux of his argument is that he did not have to file\nhis returns until 180 days after leaving the combat zone, demonstrating that he had acted more\nexpeditiously than the Judge found.  In the first place, the record does not contain evidence sufficient\nto demonstrate the extent to which this contention may be true.  We have no authority to grant\nApplicant\u2019s request to remand the case for the presentation of additional evidence.  Appeal Brief at\n2.  See ISCR Case No. 15-05047 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 8, 2017). Furthermore, a person entitled to a\nfiling extension due to service in a designated combat zone must file the return within 180 days of\nthe last day of such service.  See, e.g.,  IRS Publication 3, Armed Forces\u2019 Tax Guide, dated January\n4, 2013, at 24; IRS Pub. 3, dated December 22, 2016, at 29.  The filing extension may be extended\nup to an additional 3 \u00bd months depending on when the individual entered the combat zone. \nApplicant returned to the U.S. in March 2017 and has remained here ever since.  Nevertheless, he\ndid not file any returns until late 2019.  Even if Applicant had been entitled to a filing extension for\nat least some of his time overseas, his failure to file until long after the lapse of such grace period\nrenders this argument meritless.  \nApplicant contends that he was not aware of his right to request a hearing.  Appeal Brief at\n1-2.  The record shows, however, that Applicant\u2019s SOR included an attachment by which he could\nrequest either a hearing or a decision on the written record.  Applicant passed over the choice which\nread: \u201cIn-person at a location within 150 miles of your home or workplace, or by video-\nteleconference (VTC) hearing before an Administrative Judge [.]\u201d  Applicant initialed the block that\nread \u201cA decision based on the administrative (written) record, without an hearing before an\nAdministrative Judge.\u201d  He affixed his signature to the attachment in the presence of a notary and\nreturned it to DOHA along with his Answer to the SOR.  In addition, he received a copy of the\nDirective, which spells out an applicant\u2019s right as to choice of forum.  The record demonstrates that\nApplicant was advised of his right to request a hearing.  Applicant was not denied the due process\nafforded by the Directive.\nApplicant\u2019s brief cites to Hearing Office cases involving applicants who received favorable\ndecisions despite late tax returns.  He argues that his circumstances are similar.  We have given these\ncase due consideration as persuasive authority.  However, each case must be decided on its own\nmerits.  Hearing Office decisions are not binding upon other Hearing Office Judges or on the Appeal\nBoard.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 18-02074 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 27, 2019).  These cases have\nsignificant differences from Applicant\u2019s and provide no reason to conclude that the Judge erred in\nher analysis.  \nThe balance of Applicant\u2019s brief consists of arguments that the Judge failed to consider all\nof the evidence in the record or that she mis-weighed the evidence.  Given the extent of Applicant\u2019s\ndelinquent filings and the timing of his efforts at addressing them, we find no reason to disturb the\nJudge\u2019s overall conclusions.  Applicant has not rebutted the presumption that the Judge considered\nall of the evidence in the record, nor has he shown that she weighed the evidence in a manner that\n3\n\nwas arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 18-02872 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan.\n15, 2020). \nThe Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the\ndecision.

Applicant requested a hearing. \nOn April 28, 2020, after the hearing, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nAdministrative Judge Darlene D. Lokey Anderson denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security\nclearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge erred in her findings of fact\nand whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent\nwith the following, we affirm.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact\nApplicant was born in Israel.  He is a dual citizen of Israel and the United States.  He\npossesses a valid Israeli passport that he uses to travel to Israel.  He expressed a willingness to\nrenounce his Israeli citizenship to obtain a security clearance.  \nWhile in his mid-teens, Applicant moved to the United States with his family.  He obtained\nhis undergraduate education in the United States.  In the early 1980s, he became a U.S. citizen.  Soon\nthereafter, he moved back to Israel to marry an Israeli women.  He served in the Israeli military for\nabout four years in the mid-1980s.  He and his first wife had two children who were born in Israel. \nHe and his family moved to the United States in the early 1990s.  They moved back to Israel and\nlived there for about three years in the mid-1990s.  They then moved to Canada, where he lived and\nworked for about five years.  While in Canada, he purchased a home in Israel for over $200,000.  In\nabout 2000, he and his family moved back to Israel, and he worked there for about three years.  After\ndeciding to divorce, he left his wife and children in Israel and returned to the United States.  He\ncontinued to care for, and maintained contact with, his children.  In about 2006, he returned to Israel\nwhen one child had a dispute with his ex-wife.  About a year later, he moved back to Israel for about\nthree years to provide emotional support to one child.  While in Israel, Applicant met his current wife\nthrough the internet.  She is from a former Soviet republic.  She moved to Israel, and they married\nabout ten years ago.  They have one child who was born in Israel.  \nAbout ten years ago, Applicant worked for the Israeli Government for about one year.  This\njob involved his professional field of expertise.  He became discontented in this job before moving\nto Canada for a short period.  About eight years ago, he returned to the United States with his wife\nand child.  About six years ago, he purchased a home in the United States.  He began working for\nhis current employer about four years ago.\nAbout two years ago, Applicant returned to Israel for the marriage of one his children from\nhis first marriage.  Both of his children from that marriage are dual citizens of Israel and the United\nStates.  Both are married.  One owns a house in Israel valued at about $500,000.  He maintains\n2\n\nregular contact with them.  He also maintains contact with several friends and professional associates\nwho are citizens and residents of Israel.  \nApplicant has received praise from his company for his hard work and dedication.  His\ncompany president has recognized his achievements and nominated him and his team for a corporate\naward.\nIsrael is a parliamentary democracy.  Over the years, the United States and Israel have\ndeveloped a close friendship based on their common democratic values and security interests,\nalthough occasionally those interests have diverged.  Terrorism is an ongoing threat in Israel. \nSeveral U.S. Government employees have been prosecuted for disclosing classified information to\nindividuals connected to the Israeli Government.  Israel has an active program of gathering\nproprietary information from U.S. companies.\nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis\nApplicant\u2019s relationships with foreign family members, friends, and associates create a\nheightened risk of foreign influence and exploitation.  He maintains an Israeli passport and\ncitizenship.  For most of his life, he has traveled to and from Israel to live and work.  He is close to\nhis children in Israel.  \u201cFull mitigation under AG \u00b6 8(a), 8(b), and 8(c) has not been established. \nApplicant\u2019s foreign relationships poses a heightened security risk.\u201d  Decision at 8. \nDiscussion\nIn his appeal brief, Applicant contends that Judge erred in some of her findings of fact. \nWhen a Judge\u2019s findings are challenged, we examine them to see if they are supported by substantial\nevidence, i.e., \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a\nconclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 16-04094 at 2 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2018).  \nApplicant asserts the Judge erred in her findings regarding the dates and number of times he\nreturned to Israel and his work history.  He contends she found he returned to Israel five times when\nin fact he only did so three times and argues this error gave a false impression of his history of going\nback to Israel.  He first notes the Judge erred in her finding that he returned to Israel in 1993 and\nlived there for about three years.  At the hearing, he testified that he lived and worked in the United\nStates from 1990 to 1996 before moving to Canada.  Tr. at 25-26 and 30-32.  He next notes the\nJudge erred in finding he visited Israel in 2006 after one of his children had an argument with his ex-\nwife.  He testified, however, that he did relocate to Israel in 2007 following that argument to support\nthe child, and he remained there until about 2010 or 2011.  Tr. at 35-37.   Although the Judge erred\nin making those challenged findings of fact, such errors were harmless.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No 19-\n01220 at 3 (App. Bd. Jun. 1, 2020) (noting an error is harmless if it did not likely affect the outcome\nof the case).  The evidence supports the Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant has made \u201csome\nextraordinary moves\u201d in returning to Israel over the past 40 years.  Decision at 7.  Since becoming\n3\n\na U.S. citizen, Applicant has returned to Israel on three occasions to reside there for a number of\nyears, which includes stints when he served in the Israeli military and worked for the Israeli\nGovernment.\nApplicant notes that he was granted a security clearance while employed in the United States\nbetween 1993 and 1995.  He argues that security clearance was granted after he had served in the\nIsraeli military and when he had similar contacts in Israel.  He contends his recent denial of a security\nclearance \u201csimply makes no sense.\u201d  Appeal Brief at 2.  However, the Government is not estopped\nfrom making an adverse clearance decision because an individual has previously held a security\nclearance.  In that regard, the Government has the right to reconsider the security significance of past\nconduct or circumstances in light of more recent conduct or circumstances having negative security\nsignificance.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-01961 at 4 (App. Bd. Jul. 12, 2007).  In this case, we note,\nsince the granting of his previous security clearance, Applicant has worked for the Israeli\nGovernment and two of his children now reside in Israel.  His assertion that he previously held a\nsecurity clearance fails to establish any error.\nApplicant discussed the religious affiliations of his wife and child.  It is well established that\nthe Department of Defense does not adjudicate an applicant\u2019s clearance eligibility based on his or\nher religion.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 10-02902 at 3 (App. Bd. May 16, 2011) and ISCR Case No. \n11-02842 at 3 (App. Bd. Jun. 7, 2012).  Similarly, we do not adjudicate clearance based on the\nreligion of an applicant\u2019s family members.  \nApplicant raises other arguments that amount to a disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing\nof the evidence.  He argues, for example, that he came to the United States over 40 years ago, has\nworked most of his career here, and has extensive family members in this country.  The presence of\nsome mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance\ndecision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the\nfavorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  A party\u2019s disagreement with\nthe Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the\nevidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in\na manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-01431 at 4\n(App. Bd. Mar. 31, 2020).  Applicant also notes the denial of a security clearance will negatively\naffect him; however, the adverse impacts of security clearance decision are not relevant\nconsiderations in evaluating national security eligibility.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-02397 at 1-2\n(App. Bd. May 6, 2020).\nApplicant has failed to establish that the Judge committed any harmful error.  The Judge\nexamined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision.  The\ndecision is sustainable on this record.  \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted only\nwhen \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d  Department of the Navy v.\nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).

On February 28, 2020, after considering the record, Administrative Judge\nRobert Robinson Gales denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed\npursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant had seven delinquent debts totaling about $28,000.  The\nJudge noted there was an error regarding the amount of one of the alleged debts, and the debts\nactually totaled about $27, 300.  In responding to the SOR, Applicant admitted three of the alleged\ndebts and denied the others.  The Judge found against Applicant on all of the SOR allegations, noting\nhe offered no documentary evidence showing that he has taken or is taking actions to resolve them. \n \nApplicant\u2019s appeal brief contains documents postdating the Judge\u2019s decision.   He makes\nvarious arguments based on those documents.  The Appeal Board, however, is prohibited from\nconsidering new evidence on appeal.

In his arguments, he cites to\nvarious matters pertaining to his background, such as his military record, employment history, and\nfamily situation.  He also makes assertions regarding some of the debts.  The Judge addressed many\nof these matters in his decision.  Based on our review of the record, Applicant\u2019s arguments are\nneither enough to rebut the presumption that the Judge considered all of the evidence in the record\nnor sufficient to show that the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious,\nor contrary to law.

On March 4, 2020, after considering the record, Defense Office of Hearings\nand Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Robert Robinson Gales denied Applicant\u2019s request for\na security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we affirm.  \nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis\nApplicant\u2019s SOR alleged over $29,000 in delinquent debt, for such things as credit cards,\ncable services, a loan, a charge account, and other unspecified obligations.  Applicant attributed her\nproblems to several periods of unemployment, some of them voluntary, others not; to expenses\nincurred while administering the estate of her deceased brother; to her taking advantage of increased\nlimits on her credit cards; and to her providing financial assistance for family members.  The Judge\nfound that Applicant\u2019s debts have been ongoing since late 2016 and that she did not corroborate her\nclaims that she had been trying to resolve them.  The Judge also noted her ex-husband had child\nsupport arrearages as high as $200,000.  Applicant filed for bankruptcy protection after her receipt\nof the SOR.  In her clearance interview, she initially claimed that all of her accounts had been paid\nin full.  When the investigator confronted Applicant with her debts, however, she stated that she was\nnot aware of them, though eventually admitting that she had stopped paying them after the death of\nher brother.  In the analysis portion of the Decision, the Judge cited Applicant\u2019s many instances of\nleaving jobs voluntarily, the absence of evidence of debt resolution, the timing of Applicant\u2019s\nbankruptcy petition, her having spent funds on family members rather than on paying her debts; and\nher having taken Carribean cruises rather than satisfying her financial obligations.  He concluded that\nshe had not met her burden of persuasion as to mitigation.\nDiscussion\nIn her appeal brief, Applicant contends that she has tried to resolve her debts and that the\nJudge\u2019s decision does not give due attention to her positive character traits.  In presenting her\narguments, she includes matters from outside the record, which we cannot consider.  Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.29.  We note that Applicant\u2019s response to the File of Relevant Material (FORM) includes a\ndocument from one of the creditors cited in the SOR, advising that an automobile lien had been\nreleased.  Applicant FORM Response, Exhibit 8.  This document does not appear to relate to any of\nthe SOR allegations regarding this creditor, however.  Item 5, Credit Report dated April 17, 2019,\nat 8 at top, 5 at bottom of page.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro se\n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a trustworthiness designation. \nOn January 6, 2020, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for\nthat decision\u2014trustworthiness concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a decision on the written record.  On August 12, 2020, after considering the record,\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge LeRoy F. Foreman denied\nApplicant\u2019s request for a trustworthiness designation.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 \nE3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nThe SOR alleged that Applicant had ten delinquent debts totaling about $34,300.  In\nanswering the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations.  The Judge found:\nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he attributed his delinquent debts to his\nongoing divorce and lack of employment.  He provided no information about the date \non which the divorce proceedings began or the expenses incurred regarding them. \nHe provided no information about his dates of unemployment.  He provided no\nspecific information about his income and expenses, and no evidence of financial\ncounseling.  . . .  In his cover letter for his response to the FORM [File of Relevant\nMaterial], he stated, \u201cI am trying to be debt free in about 20 months.\u201d  [Decision at\n4].\nThe Judge concluded that Applicant failed to show that he acted responsibly under the\ncircumstances.  The Judge found in favor of Applicant on three debts and against him on the others.\nIn his appeal, Applicant does not challenge any of the Judge\u2019s specific findings of fact or\nconclusions.  Instead, he provides explanations for his financial problems and argues that those\nproblems were the result of conditions beyond his control and he is taking action to resolve them. \nHis arguments, however, are not sufficient to show that the Judge\u2019s conclusions are arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.3. \nApplicant has failed to establish that the Judge committed any harmful error.  The Judge\nexamined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision.  The\ndecision is sustainable on this record.  The standard applicable to trustworthiness cases is that set\nforth in Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) regarding security clearances:\nsuch a determination \u201c. . . may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the\nnational security.\u2019\u201d  See, e.g., ADP Case No. 19-02087 at 3 (App. Bd.
