He was born and grew up in\nNigeria. He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2003, and received his U.S.\npassport shortly thereafter. Applicant\u2019s use, renewal, and possession of a current\nNigerian passport pose an unacceptable security concern. Moreover, he deliberately\nfalsified his security clearance application. His favorable information is not\nsufficient to mitigate the security concerns. Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn September 21, 2005, Applicant submitted a security clearance application\n(GE 1, Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing). On October 11,\n2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a\nstatement of reasons (SOR) alleging facts and security concerns under Guideline B\n(Foreign Influence), Guideline C (Foreign Preference), Guideline E (Personal\nConduct), and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct). The SOR informed Applicant that\nDOHA adjudicators could not make a preliminary affirmative finding that it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant him access to classified\ninformation and submitted the case to an administrative judge for a security\ndetermination.  On December 20, 2006, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a\n1\nhearing. \nThe case was assigned to me on May 2, 2007. On June 4, 2007, I convened a\nhearing at which the government presented five exhibits, marked GE 1-5, to support\nthe SOR. Applicant testified on his own behalf, and presented two witnesses and five\nexhibits, marked AE 1-5. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on June 14, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted the factual allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.b, and 2.a \u2013 2.c,\nwith explanations. He denied that he deliberately falsified his security clearance\napplication as alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a \u2013 3.b, and \u00b6 4.a. His admissions are\n\nincorporated herein as findings of fact. After a thorough review of all evidence of\nrecord, I make the following additional findings of fact: \nApplicant is a 47-year-old security officer, working for a government\ncontractor. He was born, raised, and educated in Nigeria (GE 1). He has never been\nmarried and has no children. He completed primary and secondary education in a\nsmall town in Nigeria. At around age 20, he moved to a large city in Nigeria, and\nfrom approximately 1980 to 1986, worked for a private bank and played soccer. In\n1988, at the age of 29, he emigrated to the United States (Tr. 32). \nFrom 1988 to 2005, Applicant worked at an American Christian academy\nteaching English, mathematics, social studies, science, physical education, and bible\nstudies to children in first to eight grades. In 1994, he began attending an American\nuniversity and received a bachelor\u2019s degree in English in 2002. Applicant became a\nnaturalized U.S. citizen in October 2003, and received his U.S. passport shortly\nthereafter. He completed a master\u2019s degree in business administration (human\nresources) in 2005. In September 2005, he was hired by his current employer, a\ngovernment contractor, and issued an interim security clearance. His company\nprovides security to a sensitive U.S. agency. He requires access to classified\ninformation to retain his job (Tr. 8).\nApplicant has one brother and one sister who are citizens and residents of\nNigeria. His brother is 67 years old, and he is a widow. Applicant\u2019s brother is\nretired. He served as a medic in the Nigerian armed forces for more than 10 years\nprior to his retirement (Tr. 42-43). Applicant did not know whether his brother was\nan officer. He only remembered his brother worked as a health care provider.\nApplicant claimed he did not know what is his brother\u2019s current occupation, if any. \nApplicant\u2019s sister is 57 years old, and a widow. She retired from her job at a\nprivate television station. He calls his siblings once or twice a month, and provides\nfinancial support to both. Applicant believes it is his obligation as a brother and as a\nChristian to help his siblings. He has been sending his siblings $100-$200 every two\nto three months for many years. They divide the money among themselves based on\ntheir needs (Tr. 44-47).\nSection 17.d of Applicant\u2019s September 2005 security clearance application,\nrequired him to disclose whether within the preceding seven years he had an active\npassport issued to him by a foreign government. Applicant answered \u201cNo,\u201d and\nfailed to disclose that he was in possession of a valid Nigerian passport. He renewed\nhis passport in August 2000, and the new passport had an expiration date of August\n2005. Applicant again renewed his Nigerian passport on or about August 2005, and it\nnow has an expiration date in August 2010. He brought his active Nigerian passport\nto the hearing. Consistent with his prior statements, Applicant testified he was\nwilling and ready to surrender his Nigerian passport.\nApplicant explained he answered \u201cNo\u201d to Section 17.d, because he mistakenly\nbelieved his country of birth, Nigeria, was not a foreign country. Because he was\nborn in Nigeria, to him Nigeria is not a foreign country. He did not know that for\n\npurposes of the security clearance application, any passport from any nation except\nthe United States is considered a foreign passport (Tr. 54). \nSection 18 of Applicant\u2019s September 2005 security clearance application,\nrequired him to list any foreign countries he had visited during the preceding seven\nyears. He disclosed his travel to Germany from April 2004 to May 2005; to Germany\nand Poland during August 2004; and to the United Kingdom during August 2002.\nApplicant failed to disclose he traveled to Nigeria in August 2000, July 2001, and\nApril 2004. \nIn January 2006, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator\nconcerning the possession of an active Nigerian passport and his foreign travel.\nFollowing that interview, he sent an e-mail (dated January 2006) to the investigator\nclarifying his foreign travel (AE 1). The e-mail shows Applicant traveled to Finland\nand Nigeria during July-August 2001; to Denmark and Germany during July 2002; to\nNigeria during April-May 2004; and to Germany and Poland during August 2004.\nHis last foreign travel was to Poland in June 2006 (GE 2). In a letter to DOHA, dated\nSeptember 12, 2006, Applicant disclosed that in 2002 he traveled through London to\nNigeria for a family visit (GE 3).\nApplicant testified that the information in his security clearance application\nhad several mistakes that he tried to correct. Specifically, he meant to write 2004 as\nthe year he traveled to Nigeria to attend his mother\u2019s funeral. He also explained that\nhe did not disclose any trips to Nigeria because, since he was born in Nigeria, he did\nnot consider Nigeria a foreign country (Tr. 58). In 2004, Applicant\u2019s mother passed\naway. In April 2004, he traveled to Nigeria using both his U.S. passport and his\nNigerian passport. He explained he did not have the time to go through the process of\nrequesting a visa in order to attend his mother\u2019s funeral. \nWhile holding his interim clearance, Applicant had access to classified\ninformation. There is no evidence to show Applicant failed to comply with the rules\nand procedures for handling classified information (Tr. 158). His interim clearance\nwas withdrawn as a result of the security concerns under adjudication. The\ngovernment has not alleged, and the evidence does not show, Applicant is anything\nother than a loyal U.S. citizen.\nApplicant strongly averred he is a loyal U.S. citizen with personal,\nprofessional, and financial commitments in the United States. He promised to defend\nand take arms for the United States against any enemies. He emigrated to the United\nStates seeking the many opportunities offered and a better quality of life. He is a\nlaw-abiding person, and would not knowingly violate the laws of the United States.\nHe was improved his lifestyle while in the United States by attending college and\nadvanced education. Additionally, he has made positive contributions to the\ncommunity through his services with a Christian church. He participated in the\nchurch\u2019s outreach program visiting the needy, the elderly, and State prisons (Tr. 31).\nApplicant\u2019s witnesses and references, most of them pastors and members of\nhis Church, have known him for 10 to 15 years. They consider Applicant an excellent\nteacher, a model citizen, and role model. Applicant has established a reputation for\n\n  Directive, Section 6.3. states, \u201cEach clearance decision must be a fair and impartial common\n2\nsense determination based upon consideration of all the relevant and material information and the\npertinent criteria and adjudication policy in enclosure 2 . . .\u201d\n  AG \u00b6 2(a). states, \u201c. . .

He is not\nconsidered the type of person who would falsify a security clearance application or\nviolate the law.\nI take administrative notice of the following facts. Nigeria is a federal\nrepublic composed of 36 states and a capital territory. The government\u2019s human\nrights record is poor, and government officials at all levels commit serious abuses\nincluding politically motivated and extrajudicial killings, torture, arbitrary arrest\nand detention, infringement on privacy rights, freedom of speech, and press. Areas\nof the country are marked by serious instability and outbreaks of armed conflict\nbetween religious, political, and ethnic factions. The lack of law and order in the\ncountry poses considerable risks to travelers.\nThe Nigerian government provides strong diplomatic support to U.S.\ngovernment counter-terrorism efforts. It has condemned terrorist attacks against the\nUnited States and supported military actions against the Taliban and Al-Qaida. It\nalso has played a leading role in forging an anti-terrorism consensus among states in\ntheir region. The United States provides the people of Nigeria with substantial\nfinancial assistance in areas such as public health, education, and in their efforts of\ndeveloping effective institutions of democratic governance. Nigeria is an important\ntrading partner of the United States. There is no evidence of economic competition\nwith the United States, or that Nigeria has or ever had an intelligence gathering\nprogram targeting U.S. economic, industrial, or military critical technologies. \nPOLICIES\nThe Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be considered in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. Foremost\nare the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative guideline\napplicable to the facts and circumstances of the case. However, the guidelines are\nnot viewed as inflexible ironclad rules of law. The presence or absence of a\ndisqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative of a conclusion for or\nagainst an Applicant. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common\nsense consideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3 of the Directive,  and the\n2\nwhole person concept.  Having considered the record evidence as a whole, I conclude\n3\nGuideline B (Foreign Influence), Guideline C (Foreign Preference), Guideline E\n(Personal Conduct), and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) are the applicable relevant\nadjudicative guidelines.\nBURDEN OF PROOF\n\n  See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\n4\n  Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.32.1; ISCR Case No. 02-12199 at 3  (A pp. Bd. Apr. 3, 2006) (Substantial\n5\nevidence is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a\nconclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.); ISCR Case No. 98-0761 at 2 (App. Bd.\nDec. 27, 1999) (Substantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the\nevidence.).\n  Egan, supra n. 4, at 528, 531.\n6\n  See Id; AG \u00b6 2(b).\n7\nThe purpose of a security clearance decision is to resolve whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s eligibility for\naccess to classified information.  The government has the initial burden of proving\n4\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. To meet its burden, the government must\nestablish a prima facie case by substantial evidence.  The responsibility then shifts\n5\nto the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case. Because no\none has a right to a security clearance, the applicant carries the ultimate burden of\npersuasion.  \n6\nA person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government based on trust and confidence. The government,\ntherefore, has a compelling interest to ensure each applicant possesses the requisite\njudgment, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national\ninterests as his or her own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d\nstandard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability\nfor access to classified information in favor of protecting national security.7\nThe scope of an administrative judge\u2019s decision is limited. Nothing in this\nDecision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or\nin part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance,\nloyalty, or patriotism.  Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7. \nCONCLUSIONS\nUnder Guideline B (Foreign Influence), the government\u2019s concern is that\nforeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual has divided\nloyalties or foreign financial interests, he or she may be manipulated or induced to\nhelp a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that is not in U.S.\ninterests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest.\nAdjudication under this Guideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign\ncountry in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but\nnot limited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to target\nUnited States citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk\nof terrorism. AG \u00b6 6.\nAG \u00b6 7 sets out conditions that could raise a security concern and m ay b e d isqualifying in\nthis case, including:\n\n  See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App.\n8\nBd. Feb. 8, 2001).\n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate, friend,\nor other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact\ncreates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation,\npressure, or coercion;\n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that create a\npotential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive\ninformation or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person,\ngroup, or country by providing that information;\nThe mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, as a matter\nof law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in a foreign country, and\nan applicant has contacts with that relative, this factor alone is sufficient to create the potential for\nforeign influence and could potentially result in the compromise of classified information. 8\nApplicant has frequent contacts and a close relationship of affection and/or obligation with his\nsiblings, who are residents and citizens of Nigeria. These contacts create a risk of foreign pressure or\nattempted exploitation because there is always the possibility that Nigerian agents or criminals may\nexploit the opportunity to o btain information about the United States. His connection to his family\nmembers also create a potential conflict of interest because his relationships are sufficiently close to\nraise a security concern about his desire to help them by providing sensitive or classified\ninformation. \nThe government produced substantial evidence raising these two potentially\ndisqualifying conditions, and the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence\nand prove a mitigating condition. As previously indicated, the burden of disproving a\nmitigating condition never shifts to the government.\nThree Foreign Influence Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 8 are potentially\napplicable to these disqualifying conditions:\n(a) the nature of the relationships w ith foreign persons, the country in which these\npersons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are\nsuch that it is u nlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose\nbetween the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and\nthe interests of the U.S.;\n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or\nobligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is so minimal, or the\nindividual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S.,\nthat the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the\nU.S. interest; and\n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that\nthere is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or\nexploitation.\nAfter considering the totality of the facts and circumstances in Applicant\u2019s case, I conclude\nthat mitigating condition AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and (b) apply. Applicant has strong feelings of affection and a\nstrong sense of obligation to his siblings. The closeness of the relationship is shown by Applicant\u2019s\ntelephone contacts with his siblings, the financial support provided to them, and his travels to\nNigeria. Notwithstanding, Applicant established it is unlikely he will be placed in a position of\nhaving to choose between the interests of his family and the interests of the United States. I do not\n\n  The focus is not the country or its people, but its rulers and the nature of the government they\n9\nimpose. This approach recognizes that it makes sense to treat each country in accordance with the level\nof security concern or threat it presents to the United States. \nbelieve Applicant\u2019s relationship with his family in Nigeria creates a heightened risk for foreign\ninfluence or exploitation.\nIn deciding whether Applicant\u2019s family members are in a position to be\nexploited, I considered Nigeria\u2019s form of government.  Nigeria is a developing\n9\ncountry that, so far, posses no intelligence, economic, or industrial threat to the\nUnited States. Notwithstanding Nigeria\u2019s poor human rights record, there is no\nevidence its government seeks classified and industrial/economic information from\nthe United States. Nor is there evidence of the Nigerian government mistreating\nrelatives of U.S. citizens or U.S. citizens to obtain such information. Additionally,\ngiven the existing relationship between the governments of the United States and\nNigeria, it is unlikely Nigeria would risk loosing an important trading partner and\nthe financial support of the United States.\nAG \u00b6 8(b) applies because Applicant has developed a sufficient relationship and loyalty to\nthe United States, that he can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the United\nStates\u2019 interest. He has lived in the U nited States for approximately 19 years. He is a naturalized\nU .S. citizen and all of his financial and business interests are in the United States. Applicant has\nestablished himself as an A merican. H e worked hard as a teacher at the Christian school, and at the\nuniversity completing his bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees. H e continues this track record of diligent\nlabor in his current employment.\nUnder Guideline C  (Foreign Preference), when an individual acts in such a way as to indicate\na preference for a foreign country over the United States, then he or she may be p rone to provide\ninformation or make decisions that are harmful to the interest of the United States. AG \u00b6 9.\nApplicant became a naturalized U .S. citizen in 2003 and was issued a U.S. passport shortly\nthereafter. He used his Nigerian passport to travel to Nigeria in 2004, because he did not have the\ntime to go through the process of requesting a visa. He also renewed his Nigerian passport in 2005.\nAt his hearing, he was in possession of a current Nigerian passport that does not expire until 2010.\nForeign preference disqualifying condition AG \u00b6 10: (a) exercise of any right, privilege, or\nobligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a\nfamily m em ber. This includes but is not limited to: (1) possession o f a current foreign passport,\napplies. \nAfter considering all the foreign preference mitigating condition under AG \u00b6 11, I find that\nnone of the mitigating conditions apply. Applicant used and renewed his foreign passport after\nbecoming a U.S. citizen, and receiving his U.S. passport. A t his hearing, he was still in possession of\nhis foreign passport. He presented no evidence to show that his use of the foreign passport was\napproved by a cognizant security authority, that he has expressed a willingness to renounce his dual\ncitizenship, or that his passport has been destroyed, surrendered, or otherwise invalidated.\nApplicant\u2019s testimony (and his prior statements) indicated that he has been willing to\nrelinquish his Nigerian passport, that nobody told him to surrender his Nigerian passport, or that\nthere was a problem with him using his Nigerian passport. Notwithstanding his assertions, Applicant\nwas confronted about his possession and use of a foreign passport at least three times, i.e., by a\ngovernment investigator (GE 2), through the DOHA interrogatories, and by the SOR allegations.\nApplicant is 47 years old, and holds a bachelor\u2019s in English and a master\u2019s degree in business\nadministration. He was provided a copy of the Directive o utlining the government\u2019s security\nconcerns. He knew or should have known of the government\u2019s security concerns raised by his use\n\n  AG & 30. \n10\n  I am required to consider Applicant=s overall questionable b ehavior when evaluating the\n11\nseriousness of the conduct alleged in the SOR to determine factors such as the extent to which his\nbehavior is recent; the likelihood of recurrence; Applicant=s explanations concerning the circumstances\nof the incidents alleged; and his rehabilitation. See ISCR C ase N o. 04-09959 at 3 (App. Bd. M ay 19,\n2006).\nand possession of a current foreign passport and how to mitigate them. He has failed to m itigate the\nsecurity concerns raised under Guideline C. \nUnder Guideline E (Personal Conduct), conduct involving questionable\njudgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and\nregulations can raise questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and\nability to protect classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide\ntruthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other failure\nto cooperate with the security clearance process. AG & 15.\nRegarding SOR \u00b6 3.a, Applicant admitted he failed to disclose that during the\nseven years preceding his security clearance application he traveled to Nigeria (in\n2000), to Finland and Nigeria (during July-August 2001); to Denmark, Germany, and\nNigeria (in 2002), and Nigeria (in 2004). Applicant testified he failed to disclose his\ntravels to Nigeria because he believed Nigeria was not a foreign country and the\nUnited States was aware of his country of origin and that he had a Nigerian passport. \nConcerning SOR \u00b6 3.b, Applicant admitted he failed to disclose that he had a\nvalid Nigerian passport during the seven years preceding his security clearance\napplication. He vehemently denied, however, that his omission was deliberate or\nwith the intent to mislead the government. Applicant testified he mistakenly did not\nconsider his country of birth a foreign country and failed to disclose he had a valid\nNigerian passport. He believed the United States government was aware of his\npossession of a Nigerian passport because it was stamped numerous times by\nimmigration authorities when he departed and entered the United States. \nConsidering Applicant\u2019s age, maturity, work history, level of education, travel\nhistory, and his demeanour and testimony, I find his omissions were deliberate.\nAnalyzing the evidence as a whole, Applicant\u2019s explanations concerning his failure\nto disclose the foreign countries visited and his possession of a Nigerian passport are\nnot credible.\nUnder Guideline J (Criminal Conduct), criminal activity creates doubt about a\nperson=s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into\nquestion a person=s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and\nregulations.  As discussed under Guideline E, above, Applicant deliberately\n10\nfalsified his security clearance application. His falsification is material and a\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. ' 1001, a felony.  Disqualifying Condition (DC) \u00b6 31(a): a\n11\nsingle serious crime or multiple lesser offenses and DC \u00b6 31(c): allegation or\nadmission of criminal conduct regardless of whether the person was formally\ncharged, formally prosecuted or convicted, apply.\n \n\n ISCR Case No. 03-04147 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 4, 2005) (quoting ISCR Case No. 02-01093 at\n1 2\n4 (App. Bd. Dec. 11, 2003).\n  Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F.2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990).\n1 3\nth\nAfter considering all the Criminal Conduct Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\n32, I find they are not applicable to Applicant\u2019s case. Applicant misconduct is\nrecent, and not enough time has transpired for him to establish sufficient evidence of\nsuccessful rehabilitation.\nIn addition to the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions as\ndiscussed previously, I have considered the general adjudicative guidelines related to\nthe whole person concept under AG \u00b6 2(a). \u201cUnder the whole person concept, the\nAdministrative Judge must not consider and weigh incidents in an applicant\u2019s life\nseparately, in a piecemeal manner. Rather, the Judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s\nsecurity eligibility by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s conduct and\ncircumstances.\u201d  The directive lists nine adjudicative process factors (factors)\n12\nwhich are used for \u201cwhole person\u201d analysis. Additionally, other \u201c[a]vailable, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be\nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u201d AG \u00b6 2(a). Ultimately, the clearance\ndecision is \u201can overall common sense determination.\u201d AG \u00b6 2(c).    \nApplicant\u2019s testimony and his character reference statements show Applicant\nis a loyal U.S. citizen. There is no evidence he has ever taken any action which could\ncause potential harm to the United States. He takes pride in being an American\ncitizen and would take up arms against those who try to harm the United States. He\nhas worked diligently for his Christian church and for a defense contractor. \nNotwithstanding his favorable evidence, considering the totality of the facts\nand circumstances, including his background, education, maturity, work history, and\noutstanding character, Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns raised by\nhis behavior.\n\u201cBecause of the extreme sensitivity of security matters, there is a strong\npresumption against granting a security clearance. Whenever any doubt is raised . . .\nit is deemed best to err on the side of the government\u2019s compelling interest in\nsecurity by denying or revoking [a] clearance.\u201d  After weighing the disqualifying\n13\nand mitigating conditions, all the facts and circumstances, in the context of the\nwhole person, I conclude he has not mitigated the foreign preference, personal\nconduct, and criminal conduct security concerns. \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the\nSOR, as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:         \nParagraph 1, Guideline C:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.b\nAgainst Applicant\n\nParagraph 2, Guideline B:  \nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a \u2013 2.c\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 3.a \u2013 1.b\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 4, Guideline J:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 4.a\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance for Applicant.

O\u2019Brien, Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nThis 28-year-old software engineer has a history of financial problems that remain\ncurrent, with close to $29,000 in delinquent debts.  There has been minimal repayment of her\n\n2\ndebts, with only two small debts being paid off.  Mitigation has not yet been adequately\nestablished.  Clearance is denied. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn August 29, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2,\n1992, as amended, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant.  The SOR detailed reasons\nwhy DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding required under the Directive that it\nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant.  The SOR recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to conduct proceedings and\ndetermine whether a clearance should be granted, denied or revoked.\nOn December 11, 2006, Applicant responded to the allegations set forth in the SOR, and\nelected to have a decision made by a DOHA Administrative Judge on the written record, i.e., without\na hearing.  Department Counsel issued a File of Relevant Material (FORM) on December 20, 2006.\nThe Form instructed Applicant that any response to the FORM had to be submitted within 30 days\nof its receipt by Applicant.  Applicant received the FORM on December 7, 2006.  Any response was\ndue by January 6, 2006.  Applicant timely submitted additional information.  The matter was\nassigned to me for resolution on December 20, 2006. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant is a 28-year-old software engineer for a defense contractor.  Her SOR contains\neight (8) allegations under Guideline F (Financial Considerations).  In her responses to the SOR\n(Item 3) and Interrogatories (Item 5), Applicant admits allegations 1`.a. - 1.d., and 1.f., and denies\nallegations 1.e, 1.g., and 1.h.  The admitted allegations are accepted and incorporated herein as\nFindings of Fact.  \nAfter considering the totality of the evidence derived from the FORM and its attachments,\nincluding Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, I make the following additional FINDINGS OF FACT\nas to the status, past and present, of each SOR allegation:\nGuideline J (Financial Considerations) \nAs established by Government Exhibits/Items in the FORM, Applicant owed following\ndelinquent debts in the approximate amounts shown to the cited creditors:\n1.a. \u2013Bank A - $2,451.00 (charged off);\n1.b. - Bank B - $1,226.00 (charged off);\n\n3\n1.c. - Bank C - $1,594.00 (charged off);\n1.d. - Collection Agency D - $6,769.00;\n1.e. - Dentist E - $2,382.00;\n1.f. - Collection Agency F - $6,472.00;\n1.g. - Medical Firm G - $300.00.  This debt was paid off in July 2005 (Item 3).\n1.h. - Company H - $689.00.  This debt was paid off in July2006 (Item 3).\nThe remaining delinquent debts (1.a. - 1.f.) total about $20,894.00 \nPOLICIES\nEach adjudicative decision must also include an assessment of nine generic factors relevant\nin all cases: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding\nthe conduct, to include knowing participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6)\nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the\nconduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of\ncontinuation or recurrence (Directive, E.2.2.1., on page 16 of Enclosure 2).  I have considered all\nnine factors, individually and collectively, in reaching my overall conclusion.\nBecause each security case presents its own facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed\nthe factors cited above exhaust the realm of human experience or that the factors apply equally in\nevery case. Moreover, although adverse information concerning a single criterion may not be\nsufficient for an unfavorable determination, the individual may be disqualified if available\ninformation reflects a recent or recurring pattern of questionable financial judgment and conduct.\nBecause Applicant chose to have this matter decided without a hearing and without submitting any\nadditional information in response to the FORM, all credibility determinations and findings of fact\nare necessarily based entirely on the contents of the FORM and applicant\u2019s response thereto.\nThe eligibility criteria established by Executive Order 10865 and DoD Directive 5220.6\nidentify personal characteristics and conduct that are reasonably related to the ultimate question of\nwhether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d for an individual to hold a security\nclearance.  In reaching the fair and impartial overall common sense determination based on the\n\u201cwhole person\u201d concept required by the Directive, the Administrative Judge is not permitted to\nspeculate, but can only draw those inferences and conclusions that have a reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  In addition, as the trier of fact, the Administrative Judge must make\ncritical judgments as to the credibility of witnesses, here based solely on the written record. \nIn the defense industry, the security of classified information is entrusted to civilian workers\nwho must be counted on to safeguard classified information and material twenty-four hours a day.\nThe Government is therefore appropriately concerned where available information indicates that an\n\n4\napplicant for a security clearance, in his or her private life or connected to work, may be involved\nin conduct that demonstrates poor judgment, untrustworthiness, or unreliability.  These concerns\ninclude consideration of the potential, as well as the actual, risk that an applicant may deliberately\nor inadvertently fail to properly safeguard classified information\nAn applicant\u2019s admission of the information in specific allegations relieves the Government\nof having to prove those allegations.  If specific allegations and/or information are denied or\notherwise controverted by the applicant, the Government has the initial burden of proving those\ncontroverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons.  If the Government meets its burden (either\nby the Applicant\u2019s admissions or by other evidence) and proves conduct that creates security\nconcerns under the Directive, the burden of persuasion then shifts to the Applicant to present\nevidence in refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the existence\nof conduct that falls within specific criteria in the Directive, it is nevertheless consistent with the\ninterests of national security to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.  I find that\nthe financial issues in question do raise security concerns under Directive Guideline F.  \nA person seeking access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the\nGovernment based upon trust and confidence.  As required by DoD Directive 5220.6, as amended,\nat E2.2.2., \u201cany doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with the\ninterests of national security will be resolved in ``favor of the nation\u2019s security.\u201d\nCONCLUSIONS\nSince this matter is being decided without a hearing, my evaluation is necessarily limited to\nthe contents of the various documents that are found in the case file, including Applicant\u2019s responses\nto the SOR and FORM.  In attachments to his response to the SOR, Applicant established that he\nhad paid off the debts cited in 1.f and 1.g.  However, he had not documented the paying off or other\nresolution of the remaining delinquent debts cited in the SOR, and totaling about $20,894.  In her\nresponse to the FORM, she explains the circumstances behind her problems and adds that she is\n\u201cmaking an effort to pay off my accounts.\u201d  To date, however, she has not documented either\npayments or any other efforts at resolving the debts.\nThe overall record shows a history of delinquent debts, most of which have not yet been\nresolved despite the passage of significant time since the beginning of the present security clearance\ninvestigation and adjudication.  Applicant\u2019s statement that three of her debts had been written off\n(Item 5) may or may not have been meant as a denial of responsibility, but it at least suggests a lack\nof understanding of the effect of such thinking and/or conduct on her eligibility to hold a security\nclearance.\nThe Concern: An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage\nin illegal acts to generate funds. \nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include: 1. A history\nof not meeting financial obligations; and 3. Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns include: None that are established by the\nrecord; e.g., 1. The behavior is still recent; 2. It was not an isolated incident; 3. There is no showing\n\n5\nthat the conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss\nof employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation); There is no evidence that Applicant has received or is receiving counseling for the\nproblem and there are no clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control; and\n6. Applicant\u2019s efforts at resolving her delinquent debts is, in context, minimal, and does not yet show\nthat she has initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nLikewise, under the Directive\u2019s whole person concept, I come to the same conclusion.  In\nsummary, the Governments evidence makes a prima facie case against Applicant, and Applicant\u2019s\nevidence does not come anywhere near meeting her obligation to refute the overwhelming negative\nevidence.  The evidence compels the conclusion that Applicant currently lacks the judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness required of anyone seeking access to the nation\u2019s secrets.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings as required by Section 3, Paragraph 7 of Enclosure 1 of the Directive are\nhereby rendered as follows:\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) \nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph  l.a.           \nAgainst the Applicant\n                \nSubparagraph 1.b.               \nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.          \nAgainst the Applicant\n                \nSubparagraph 1.d.               \nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.           \nAgainst the Applicant\n                \nSubparagraph 1.f.               \nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g.           \nFor the Applicant\n                \nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nBARRY M.

See\nalso, Tr., 12 - 13.\n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn October 31, 2003, Applicant submitted a Public Trust Position Application (SF 85P).\nAfter reviewing the results of the ensuing background investigation, adjudicators for the Defense\nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) were unable to make a preliminary affirmative finding  that\n1\nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a position of trust. On July 18,\n2006, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts that raise\ntrustworthiness concerns addressed in the Directive under Guideline E (personal conduct) and\nGuideline J (criminal conduct).\nApplicant timely responded to the SOR, and requested a hearing. The case was assigned to\na DOHA administrative judge on October 13, 2006. A hearing originally scheduled for November\n20, 2006, was cancelled when the case was transferred to me on November 17, 2006, due to caseload\nconsiderations. I convened a hearing on January 8, 2007.  The government submitted eight exhibits\n2\n(Gx. 1- 10) that were admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant testified and introduced\none exhibit (Ax. A), which was admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on\nJanuary 17, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe government alleged in SOR \u00b6 1 that Applicant was arrested in December 1992 and\ncharged with statutory sexual seduction, but pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of contributing to the\ndelinquency of a minor, for which he spent four days in jail (SOR \u00b6 1.a); that in April 1997, he was\ncharged with corporal injury to spouse and battery, and after pleading guilty he was sentenced to 40\nhours community service, fined, and ordered to complete a 32-session domestic violence program\n(SOR \u00b6 1.b); that in November 1998, he was charged with two counts of aggravated battery (SOR\n\u00b6 1.c);  that in May 1999, he was charged with violating his probation for the charge listed in SOR\n\u00b6 1.a, was found guilty and sentenced to three years of probation (SOR \u00b6 1.d); that in April 2003 he\nwas charged with battery of his spouse and probation violation (SOR \u00b6 1.e); and that he violated 18\nU.S.C. \u00a7 1001 by deliberately falsifying his SF 85P in October 2003 (SOR \u00b6 1.f). In response,\nApplicant admitted with explanation the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c. He denied the\nallegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.e, and 1.f. \nUnder SOR \u00b6 2, the government alleged Applicant deliberately falsified his response to\nquestion 16 of his SF 85P (arrests, charges, and/or convictions for any offense in the past seven\nyears) by omitting the arrests alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, and 1.e (SOR \u00b6 2.a).

After a thorough review of the transcript and\nexhibits, I make the following additional findings of relevant fact:\nApplicant is 32 years old and has worked since February 2001 as a network design engineer\nfor a health care and medical insurance company contracted to manage medical insurance claims and\ninformation for TriCare, the Department of Defense (DoD) medical insurance system for military\npersonnel and their families. He has been married to his current wife since June 2003. A previous\nmarriage began in 1992. They separated in 1993, and a divorce was finalized in 1997. Applicant and\nhis first wife had one child. He has adopted his current wife\u2019s child, and he has a third child by a\ndifferent woman whom he never married.3\nApplicant served in the U.S. Marines from September 1993 until July 1997. He was initially\ntrained as a scout sniper, but was later trained to work on information networks. He attended college\nbriefly following high school, but finished his business degree while in the Marines.  He has been\n4\nemployed continuously as a network engineer since he left the military with a general discharge\nunder honorable conditions.5\nIn December 1992, when Applicant was 18 years old, he dated and had consensual sex with\na girl he thought was at least 18 years old. In fact, she was only 16 years old. When her mother\nlearned of their relationship, she filed charges that led to Applicant\u2019s arrest for statutory sexual\nseduction. He pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of contributing to the delinquency of a minor, and was\nsentenced to 90 days in jail, of which all but four days was suspended.6\nWhile still in the Marine Corps, Applicant was at a party at his sister\u2019s house on April 5,\n1997. When a fight broke out, Applicant, who had been drinking, stepped in and fought with his\nsister\u2019s husband. One result of the fight was that he struck his wife, which he claimed was accidental.\nAnother result was that he was charged with corporal injury to spouse and battery. He was convicted\nof the latter charge, fined, ordered to perform 40 hours of community service. Applicant was also\nordered to complete a 32-hour domestic violence program and placed on three years probation.7\nApplicant failed to pay the entire fine on time, and did not complete all of his community\nservice. The court issued a bench warrant for his arrest. In May 1999, after being pulled over for\nspeeding, he was arrested and spent more than three weeks in jail before appearing in court.

Haave, Deputy\n14\nUnder Secretary of Defense for Counterintelligence and Security to DOHA Director, Adjudication of Trustworthiness\nCases (Nov. 19, 2004), directed that adjudication of trustworthiness cases for ADP I, II, and III positions be resolved\nusing the provisions of the Directive rather than, as originally drafted, DoD Regulation 5200.2-R, DoD Personnel\nSecurity Program, as amended (Regulation). Applicant did not object and I granted the motion. (Tr., 11) Positions\ndesignated as ADP I or ADP II are classified as sensitive positions in section AP10.2.1 of the Regulation. ADP III\npositions are nonsensitive positions. (Regulation, AP10.2.3.1) By virtue of the aforementioned memorandum, however,\neven though they are nonsensitive positions, ADP III cases are treated in the same way and adjudicated under the same\nguidelines and procedures as ADP I and II cases. The adjudicative guidelines in the Directive cases are virtually identical\nto those in the Regulation.\n4\nIn April 2000, Applicant was detained by police who thought he looked suspicious as he\nwalked home from a bar after having \u201ca few too many drinks.\u201d A records check revealed the same\nbench warrant for failing to pay his fine, and he was arrested. Applicant testified this event is \u201ca\nfunny story\u201d he tells his friends.9\nApplicant was also arrested in November 1998 and charged with two counts of aggravated\nbattery after he was involved in a bar fight. Applicant acknowledged he was involved in such a fight,\nbut asserts he did not start it and that the charges were dropped after he spent a night in jail. There\nis no other information available about the disposition of these charges.10\nOn October 31, 2003, Applicant submitted a Public Trust Position Application (SF 85P). In\nresponse to question 16 (arrests, charges, and/or convictions for any offense in the past seven years),\nApplicant answered \u201cno,\u201d thereby omitting any arrests since October 1997. Applicant claims he was\ntold only to list such information only if it occurred in the preceding five years, or since October\n1998. He further asserted that, because he did not consider the 1999 or 2000 arrests for failing to\ncomplete the sentence from his 1997 conviction to be new charges, he did not think he had to list it.11\nApplicant enjoys a good reputation at work. Colleagues who have known him for most or\nall of the time he has worked in his current job regard him as accomplished in his work, a good\nfamily man, and willing to help others at work and in the community.12\nPOLICIES AND BURDEN OF PROOF\nThe Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines  to be considered in evaluating an\n13\napplicant\u2019s suitability for access to sensitive information.  Each trustworthiness determination must\n14\nreflect consideration of both disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under\n\n Also, Appendix 8 of the Regulation sets forth the adjudicative policy, as well as the disqualifying conditions\n15\nand mitigating conditions associated with each guideline. DoD contractor personnel are afforded the adjudication\nprocedures contained in the Directive. (Regulation, C8.2.1)\n Directive, 6.3.\n16\n \u201cThe adjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person\n17\nconcept. Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be\nconsidered in reaching a determination. In evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the adjudicator should\nconsider the following factors:\n \nE2.2.1.1. The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct;\n \nE2.2.1.2. The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation;\n \nE2.2.1.3. The frequency and recency of the conduct;\n \nE2.2.1.4. The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct;\n \nE2.2.1.5. The voluntariness of participation;\n \nE2.2.1.6. The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes;\n \nE2.2.1.7. The motivation for the conduct;\n \nE2.2.1.8. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and\n \nE2.2.1.9. The likelihood of continuation or recurrence;\u201d\n Regulation, C6.1.1.1 (\u201cThe standard that must be met for...assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all\n18\navailable information, the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that...assigning the person to sensitive\nduties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d)\n See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n19\n5\neach adjudicative issue applicable to the facts and circumstances of each case.  Each determination\n15\nmust also reflect a fair and impartial common sense consideration of all available relevant and\nmaterial information,  and it must reflect the adjudication process outlined in the Directive at\n16\nSection E2.2.1.  The presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not\n17\ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable guidelines\nshould be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they represent policy guidance\ngoverning the grant or denial of access to sensitive information. Having reviewed the information\npresented by the parties, I conclude Guideline J (criminal conduct) and Guideline E (personal\nconduct) must be considered in this case.\nUnder the Regulation, trustworthiness determinations are intended solely to resolve whether\nit is clearly consistent with the interests of national security for an applicant to receive or continue\nto have access to sensitive information.  The government bears the initial burden of producing\n18\nadmissible information on which it based the preliminary decision against the applicant.\nAdditionally, the government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the\ngovernment meets its burden, the burden then shifts to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate\nthe government\u2019s case. As with security clearances, no one has a \u201cright\u201d to such access.  Thus, an\n19\napplicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion. Access to sensitive information is a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government based on trust and confidence. The government, therefore, has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability and\ntrustworthiness of one who will protect sensitive information pertaining to the national interests as\nhis or her own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the interests of national security\u201d standard compels\n\n See Egan; Directive, E2.2.2.\n20\n Directive, E2.A10.1.1.\n21\n Title 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001.\n22\n  Directive, E2.A10.1.2.1.

A single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses.\n6\nresolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the\ngovernment.20\nCONCLUSIONS\nCriminal Conduct. Applicant\u2019s arrests and false statements to the government raise\ntrustworthiness concerns addressed in the Directive under Guideline J. Specifically, a history or\npattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.21\nA person who is willing to disregard the law and risk fines or incarceration may also be willing to\ndisregard rules and regulations governing the protection of sensitive information. The criminal\nactivity at issue may consist of a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses. \nHere, the government has reasonable doubts about Applicant\u2019s suitability for access to\nsensitive information because available information shows he has been arrested at least five times\nsince 1992. He was convicted of contributing to the delinquency of a minor in 1993 (SOR \u00b6 1.a), and\nof battery and spousal injury in 1997 (SOR \u00b6 1.b). While on probation, he was held overnight in jail\nafter a fight in 1998 (SOR \u00b6 1.c). In 1999 (SOR \u00b6 1.d) and 2000 (SOR \u00b6 1.e), he was arrested on\nbench warrants issued for failing to comply with the terms of his sentence in 1997. \nAvailable information also shows he deliberately made false statements to the government\nthrough his response to SF 85P question 16 in October 2003 (SOR \u00b6 1.f). Applicant denied\nintentionally falsifying his answer because he was told to list only offenses within the preceding five\nyears. Further, he claimed he did not believe he had to list either his 1999 arrest or his 2000 arrest\nbecause both related back to his original conviction in 1997. I accept his claim he was told to list\nevents from the preceding five years; however, I do not accept his explanation of why he omitted his\n1999 and 2000 arrests. On both occasions, he was held in jail and had to appear in court. He has not\nprovided an explanation of his omission of the 1998 arrest for aggravated battery, for which he spent\nthe night in jail before the charges were dropped. \nBy the plain language of question 16, Applicant was to lists arrests, as well as convictions,\nand there is no qualifying language about the basis of the arrest. It is against federal criminal law and\npunishable by fines and/or imprisonment to knowing and wilfully make a false statement or\nrepresentation to any agency of the U.S. government concerning a matter within its jurisdiction.22\nApplicant, a college graduate and, by all appearances an intelligent person, signed his SF 85P\ndirectly below an advisement to that effect, thereby demonstrating he was aware of the consequences\nof his false statements. All of the foregoing requires consideration of Guideline J DC 1 and DC 2.23\n\n Directive, E2.A10.1.3.1. The criminal behavior was not recent.\n24\n Directive, E2.A10.1.3.6. There is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation.\n25\n Directive, E2.A5.1.1.\n26\n Directive, E2.A5.1.2.2. The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts\n27\nfrom any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations,\ndetermine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness,\nor award fiduciary responsibilities;\n Directive, E2.A5.1.3.4. Omission of material facts was caused or significantly contributed to by improper or\n28\ninadequate advice of authorized personnel, and the previously omitted information was promptly and fully provided.\n See note 20, supra.\n29\n Directive, E2.2.3. \n30\n7\nBy contrast, were it not for Applicant\u2019s deliberate falsification of his SF 85P, the record\nwould require consideration of Guideline J MC 1.  His arrests and other conduct occurred nearly\n24\nsix years ago, and there appear to have been several recent positive changes in his lifestyle. However,\nhis violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 is recent. In light of Applicant\u2019s work record, I have also\nconsidered MC 6.  But the value of this mitigator is attenuated by his deliberate false statement to\n25\nthe government. His criminal conduct is recent, it is not isolated, and his deliberate false statement\nto the government directly undermines any argument that he is rehabilitated. In sum, there is\ninsufficient information available to overcome the government\u2019s concerns about his criminal\nconduct. I conclude Guideline J against the Applicant.\nPersonal Conduct. Under Guideline E, a security concern may arise if it is shown an\napplicant has exhibited questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. Such conduct may indicate the\nperson may not properly safeguard classified information.  The government questioned Applicant\u2019s\n26\ntrustworthiness by alleging he deliberately falsified material facts on his SF 85P by omitting his\narrests in 1998, 1999, and 2000 in response to question 16 (SOR \u00b6 2.a). Based on the discussion of\nthis allegation, above, within the context of criminal conduct, I conclude from all available\ninformation about his SF 85P that he intended to minimize the scope of his criminal conduct.\nGuideline E DC 2  must be considered. \n27\nI have also considered Guideline E MC 4  in that Applicant was told to go back only five\n28\nyears. However, this does not explain his omission of events less than five years old. Nor did\nApplicant promptly correct his omissions as nearly eight months passed before he was interviewed\nby government investigators, and there is nothing in the record showing he tried to correct his\nomissions before then. Based on all of the foregoing, I conclude Guideline E against the Applicant.\nWhole Person. In evaluating Applicant\u2019s case, I have also considered the adjudicative\nprocess factors collectively referred to as the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept.  Applicant is a smart, hard-\n29\nworking person. His friends and co-workers speak highly of him and he is, by all accounts, very good\nat his job. However, the recommendations he provided carry diminished weight in that none of their\nremarks demonstrate any firsthand knowledge of the adverse information in Applicant\u2019s background.\nA fair and commonsense assessment  of the entire record before me shows the government properly\n30\nexpressed reasonable doubts about Applicant\u2019s suitability to hold a sensitive position. The SOR was\n\n8\nbased on sufficient, reliable information about Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct, and his deliberate\nfalsification of his SF 85P. Such issues bear directly on an applicant\u2019s ability and willingness to\nexercise the requisite good judgment and discretion expected of one in whom the government\nentrusts its sensitive information. \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings regarding each SOR allegation are as follows:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J (Criminal Conduct):\nAGAINST THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst the Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E (Personal Conduct): AGAINST THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst the Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant\u2019s request for eligibility for\nassignment to a sensitive position.

Applicant has not mitigated security concerns for\nfinancial considerations and personal conduct.  Eligibility is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn August 1, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearing and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement\nof Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision to deny an application for a position of public\ntrust for Applicant.  The action was taken under Department of Defense Regulation 5200.2-R,\nPersonnel Security Program (January 1987), as amended (Regulation), and Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2,\n1992), as amended (Directive).  Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR in an undated response\nreceived at DOHA on August 11, 2006.  The SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline F\n(Financial Considerations), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the Regulation.\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on August 25, 2006, admitting all of the factual\nallegations under Guideline F, but denying the security concern for financial considerations, and\nadmitting the factual allegation under Guideline E, but denying the security concern for personal\nconduct.  She elected to have the matter decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.\nDepartment Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written case on January 10, 2007.\nApplicant received a complete file of relevant material (FORM) on January 17, 2007, and was\nprovided the opportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the\ndisqualifying conditions.

The adjudicative\nguidelines at issue in this case are:\nGuideline F - Financial Considerations: A security concern exists for an individual who is\nfinancially irresponsible.  An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be\nirresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligations to protect classified information.\nBehaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life provides an indication of how a\nperson may behave in other aspects of life.\n\nDoD 5200.2-R, Appendix 8.\n6\nDoD 5200.2-R, \u00b6 C8.2.1.\n7\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n8\nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd.

Any of these characteristics in a person could indicate that\nthe person may not properly safeguard classified information.\nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those\nwhich would mitigate security concerns, pertaining to the adjudicative guidelines are set forth and\ndiscussed in the conclusions section below.\nThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.  An administrative\njudge must apply the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d and consider and carefully weigh the available, reliable\ninformation about the person.  An administrative judge should consider: (1) the nature, extent, and\nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the applicant\u2019s age and maturity at the\ntime of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation\nand other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation of recurrence.6\nDoD contractor personnel are afforded the rights to the procedures contained in the DoD\nDirective before any final unfavorable access determination may be made.   Initially, the Government\n7\nmust present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR that disqualify or may disqualify the\nApplicant from being eligible for access to classified information.   Thereafter, Applicant is\n8\nresponsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts.   An applicant \u201chas\n9\nthe ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or\ncontinue his security clearance.\u201d   \u201c[T]he Directive presumes there is a nexus or rational connection\n10\nbetween proven conduct under any of the criteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security\nsuitability.\u201d   \u201cAny doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with\n11\nnational security will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d   Each clearance decision must\n12\nbe fair, impartial, and a commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and\ncircumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors listed in the Regulation, Appendix 8.  A\n\nSee Exec.

The decision to deny an individual a security\nclearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.   It is merely an\n13\nindication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines have established for issuing a clearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI carefully considered all of the facts in evidence and the legal standards discussed above.  I\nreach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the SOR.\nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts reported by credit reports and admitted by Applicant brings the\nmatter within Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions E2.A6.1.2.1 (a history of not\nmeeting financial obligations), and E2.A6.1.2.3 (an inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts).\nApplicant provides no explanation how or why the debts were accumulated.  I conclude the above\ndisqualifying conditions have been established.\nI considered Financial Consideration Mitigating Conditions E2.A6.1.3.1 (The behavior was\nnot recent), and E2.A6.1.3.2 (It was an isolated incident).  Applicant has not satisfied the debts so\nthe debts are current.  The debts range from unpaid medical bills, to utility and retail bills.  The debts\nare not recent and not isolated, since they are long standing, not paid, and from various sources.  The\nmitigating conditions do not apply.\nI considered all of the other Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition and determine\nnone apply.  Applicant presented no information concerning her actions to pay her debts.  There is\nno evidence of any condition beyond her control that caused her indebtedness so MC E2.A6.1.3.3 (the\nconditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation)\ndoes not apply.  Applicant did not present any information on any financial counseling she sought or\nreceived so MC E2.A6.1.3.4 (The person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and\nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control) does not apply. \nApplicant presented no information concerning any attempt to repay any of the debts so MC\nE2.A6.1.3.6 (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise\nresolve debts) does not apply.  Applicant admitted to the debts and took no action to pay or resolve\nthem.  Applicant presented no information raising any other mitigating condition, so she has failed\nto carry her burden to establish mitigation for her debts.  I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the\nsecurity concerns for financial considerations.\nApplicant\u2019s failure to list on her public trust application all debts past due over 180 days\nbrings the matter under Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition E2.A5.1.2.2 (the deliberate\nomission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from the personal security\nquestionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations . . .\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness). Applicant admitted she knew about the\ndebts, but answered the financial question incorrectly.  Since she knew of the debt, her false answer\nwas deliberate and misleading.  I find Applicant deliberately failed to provide correct information in\n\n6\nresponse to question 22b on the public trust position application.\nI carefully considered all of the circumstances in light of the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept.  I\nconclude Applicant is not eligible for a position of public trust.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as required by Section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a. thru 1.t.:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a.:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national security to grant or continue eligibility for assignment to sensitive duties\nfor Applicant.

Blank, Jr., Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nLOUGHRAN, Edward W., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant mitigated the concerns raised by his foreign preference and foreign \ninfluence. Eligibility for access to sensitive information is granted. \n \nOn December 19, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the trustworthiness concerns under \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference and Guideline B, Foreign Influence. The action was \ntaken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel \nSecurity Program, dated January 1987, as amended (Regulation), and the revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on January 22, 2008, and requested a \nhearing before an Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to me on February 25, \n2008. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on March 14, 2008. I convened the hearing as \nscheduled on April 9, 2008. The Government offered exhibits (GE) 1 through 4, which \nwere admitted without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf, and submitted \nApril 30, 2008\n\n2 \nExhibits (AE) A through E, which were received without objection. DOHA received the \ntranscript of the hearing (Tr.) on April 18, 2008.  \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice \nof certain facts relating to Russia and Ukraine. Applicant did not object. The request and \nthe attached documents were not admitted into evidence but were included in the \nrecord as Hearing Exhibits (HE) I through XV. The facts administratively noticed are set \nout in the Findings of Fact, below.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is 29 years old. He was born in Russia. He came to the United States \nin 1997 and became a U.S. citizen in 2004. He is married with three children, ages \nseven, five, and three years old. All his children were born in the U.S. His wife is \npregnant with their fourth child. He has an associate\u2019s degree from an American \ncollege.1 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents were born in Russia. They are both 66 years old. They \nbrought Applicant and his three brothers to the U.S. in 1997, when he was 19 years old, \nand were accepted as refugees because of religious persecution. His parents both \nbecame U.S. citizens and reside in the U.S. His three brothers are also U.S. citizens \nand residents. His family members have not formally applied to renounce their Russian \ncitizenship. His grandparents are deceased. He has some extended family in Russia, \nbut he has not had any contact with them since his trip there in 2006.2 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife was born in Ukraine. She came to the U.S. in 1995. She became \na U.S. citizen in 2004. Her parents live in the U.S. as permanent residents. She has \nseven brothers and sisters. They all now live in the United States. Six of her siblings are \nU.S. citizens. One sibling is a permanent resident.3   \n \n \nApplicant had a Russian passport that was issued in 2002. He traveled to Russia \nin 2003, before he became a U.S. citizen, to obtain dental work. As a Russian citizen it \nwas much less than he would have paid in the U.S. He spent about three weeks in \nRussia on that trip. He continued to possess the passport after he became a U.S. \ncitizen. He used the Russian passport during a 2006 trip to enter and exit Russia. With \na Russian passport, Applicant saved the cost of a visa to enter Russia. He visited \nUkraine on the same trip and used his U.S. passport to enter and exit Ukraine. The \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 26-29, 53; GE 1-3. \n \n2 Tr. at 26, 35-37, 42, 55; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 3. \n \n3 Tr. at 29 53-56; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 3. \n \n\n3 \npassport expired in 2007. He has no intention to renew the passport or obtain another \nRussian passport. He is willing to renounce his Russian citizenship.4 \n \n \nApplicant is very highly regarded by his current employer. He is described as an \nexemplary employee of the highest caliber, dependable, hard working, punctual, polite, \ndedicated, intelligent and ethical. His performance appraisals were very positive. The \ngeneral manager of where he worked from 1998 to 2005, wrote that Applicant was \npromoted three times during his employment and that he was an extremely valuable \nasset because of his loyalty, work ethic, and cheerful demeanor. He was recommended \n\u201cfor any position where integrity and trust are required.\u201d5 \n \nThe Russian Federation \n \nThe Russian Federation is composed of 21 republics. The Government consists \nof a strong president, a prime minister, a bicameral legislature and a weak judiciary. It is \na vast and diverse country with a population of 142 million people. It achieved \nindependence with the dissolution of the Soviet Union on August 24, 1991. It is a \nnuclear superpower that continues to develop politically, socially, and economically. \n \nThe threat of terrorism in Russia continues to be significant. Travel in the areas in \nthe vicinity of Chechnya may be dangerous, despite Russian efforts to suppress the \nterrorists. Acts of terrorism include taking hostages and bombings.  \n \nRussia has recognized the legitimacy of international human rights standards, \nbut human rights abuses continue. Both Russian federal forces and Chechen rebel \nforces \nact \nwith \nimpunity \nwhile \nengaging \nin \ntorture, \nsummary \nexecutions, \ndisappearances, and arbitrary detentions. Additional problems include corruption, media \nsuppression, life-threatening prison conditions, and corruption in law enforcement.  \n \nThe Russian Federation\u2019s intelligence capability is significant and focuses on \ncollection of information from the United States. As of 2005, Russia and China were the \ntwo most aggressive collectors of sensitive and protected U.S. technology and \naccounted for the majority of such targeting. Russia also provides technologies which \ncould be used in the construction of weapons of mass destruction and missiles to other \ncountries. It is a leading arms exporter, with major sales of advanced weapons and \nmilitary-related technology to China, India, Iran, and Venezuela.  \n \nU.S. citizens who have at one time held Russian citizenship may be required to \nrenounce Russian citizenship before applying for a Russian visa in their U.S. passport. \nUnless a Russian citizen has formally renounced his or her Russian citizenship, he or \nshe risks being considered a Russian citizen and not allowed to depart except on a \nRussian passport. \n \n \n                                                          \n4 Tr. at 31-33, 47, 51-52; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1-4. \n \n5 AE A-E. \n \n\n4 \nUkraine \n \n \nUkraine has a parliamentary-presidential type of government since becoming \nindependent of the Soviet Union in 1991. It is undergoing profound political and \neconomic change as it moves toward a market economy and multiparty democracy.  \nAfter the first free elections in December 1991, presidential elections were marred by \ngovernment intimidation and electoral fraud. Subsequent parliamentary and local \nelections in 2006 and 2007 were in line with international standards. Ukraine has \nsignificant human rights problems. Even though prohibited by law, there have been \ninstances of torture, arbitrary detention of persons critical of the government, and \nwarrantless violations of privacy.   \n \n \nUkraine inherited a military force of 780,000 from the Soviet Union, and is \nseeking to modernize with an eye toward achieving NATO standards. Ukraine \nparticipates in six United Nation peacekeeping missions and has a small number of \ntroops serving in supporting roles with Coalition forces in Iraq.    \n \n \nUkraine\u2019s foreign policy goals include membership in the World Trade \nOrganization, the European Union, and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Ukraine \nhas peaceful and constructive relations with its neighbors. Relations with Russia are \ndifficult and complex, however, due to differing foreign policy priorities in the region, \nenergy dependence, payment arrears, disagreement over stationing of Russian military \nforces, and some boundary disputes.   \n \nPresident Bush visited Ukraine on April 1, 2008. He praised Ukraine\u2019s democratic \nand military reforms and noted that Ukraine is the only non-NATO country supporting \nevery NATO mission. He announced that the United States strongly supported \nUkraine\u2019s request to join NATO.6 \n \nPolicies \n \nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d  \n(See Regulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.)  \u201cThe standard that must be met for \n. . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the \nperson\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to \nsensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d (See \nRegulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1.) The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence \nand Security) Memorandum, dated November 19, 2004, indicates trustworthiness \nadjudications will apply to cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense Security Service \nand Office of Personnel Management. Department of Defense contractor personnel are \nafforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any final \nunfavorable access determination may be made. (See Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.)   \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the \nAG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \n                                                          \n6 I take administrative notice of this paragraph independent of the Government\u2019s request. \n \n\n5 \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \n[sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable \ntrustworthiness decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nsensitive information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Preference is set out in \nAG \u00b6 9: \n \nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a \nforeign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to \nprovide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of \nthe United States. \n\n6 \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 10. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after \nbecoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family \nmember. This includes but is not limited to: \n \n(1) possession of a current foreign passport;  \n \n(3) accepting educational, medical, retirement, social welfare, or \nother such benefits from a foreign country; \n \n(b) action to acquire or obtain recognition of a foreign citizenship by an \nAmerican citizen. \n \n \nApplicant traveled to Russia in 2003 to obtain dental work. This occurred before \nhe became a U.S. citizen. That action does not raise a disqualifying condition. He \npossessed and used a Russian passport while a U.S. citizen. The passport expired in \n2007. This raises AG \u00b6 10(a) as a concern. The use of the Russian passport while a \nU.S. citizen could also raise a concern under AG \u00b6 10(b), as an action to obtain \nrecognition of his Russian citizenship.  \n \nConditions that could mitigate Foreign Preference security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 11, including: \n \n(a) dual citizenship is based solely on parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in a \nforeign country; \n \n(b) the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual \ncitizenship; \n \n(c) exercise of the rights, privileges, or obligations of foreign citizenship \noccurred before the individual became a U.S. citizen or when the \nindividual was a minor; \n \n(d) use of a foreign passport is approved by the cognizant security \nauthority; and \n \n(e) the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant \nsecurity authority, or otherwise invalidated. \n \nRussia may continue to consider Applicant a Russian citizen until he formally \nrenounces his Russian citizenship. AG \u00b6 11(a) does not totally apply because he \nactively exercised his Russian citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen. AG \u00b6 11(b) is \napplicable because he expressed a willingness to renounce his Russian citizenship. \nThe passport is expired and Applicant does not intend to renew it or obtain another one. \nAG \u00b6 11(e) is applicable.  \n \n\n7 \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in \nAG \u00b6 7: \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. Three are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information; and \n \n(d) sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents, siblings, and six of his wife\u2019s seven siblings are U.S. citizens \nand residents. They may also be considered citizens of Russia or Ukraine because they \nhave not formally renounced their former citizenships. His wife\u2019s parents and one of her \nsiblings are not U.S. citizens, but live here as permanent residents.7 I find the \nconnection that Applicant\u2019s family has with their former countries is minimally sufficient \nto create a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, \nor coercion, or raise a potential conflict of interest. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and (b) have been raised \nby the evidence.  \n \nConditions that could mitigate Foreign Influence security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 8. The following is potentially applicable:  \n \n                                                          \n7 The citizenship of Applicant\u2019s parents-in-law was not raised in the SOR, and is therefore not \nconsidered for disqualifying purposes, but will be considered when analyzing the whole person. \n \n\n8 \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S. \n \nAlmost all of Applicant and his wife\u2019s family are now U.S. citizens and residents. \nThe few remaining who are not yet citizens are permanent residents. I find that it is \nextremely unlikely Applicant will be placed in a position of having to choose between the \ninterests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of \nthe U.S. AG \u00b6 8(a) is applicable. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the \nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a public \ntrust position must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case and I considered the totality of \nApplicant\u2019s ties to Russia and Ukraine. Applicant was born in Russia. His entire family \ncame to the U.S. in 1997 as refugees because of religious persecution. His parents and \nthree brothers all became U.S. citizens and reside in the United States, but they have \nnot formally applied to renounce their Russian citizenship. His wife came to the U.S. in \n1995. She became a U.S. citizen in 2004. Her parents live in the U.S. as permanent \nresidents. Her seven brothers and sisters live in the United States and all are U.S. \ncitizens, except for one sibling who is a permanent resident. Applicant used a Russian \npassport to enter Russia after becoming a U.S. citizen. The passport has expired and \nhe does not intend to renew it or obtain another one. He is willing to renounce his \nRussian citizenship.  \n \nI considered the nature of the governments of Russia and Ukraine. Both \ncountries have human rights issues and Russia has been victimized by terrorism and is \nknown to conduct intelligence operations against the United States. Ukraine is moving \n\n9 \ncloser to obtaining NATO status. However, Guideline B is not limited to countries hostile \nto the United States. \u201cThe United States has a compelling interest in protecting and \nsafeguarding classified information from any person, organization, or country that is not \nauthorized to have access to it, regardless of whether that person, organization, or \ncountry has interests inimical to those of the United States.\u201d8 The distinctions between \nfriendly and unfriendly governments must be made with caution. Relations between \nnations can shift, sometimes dramatically and unexpectedly. Furthermore, friendly \nnations can have profound disagreements with the United States over matters they view \nas important to their vital interests or national security. Finally, we know friendly nations \nhave engaged in espionage against the United States, especially in the economic, \nscientific, and technical fields. Nevertheless, the nature of a nation\u2019s government, its \nrelationship with the U.S., and its human rights record are relevant in assessing the \nlikelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable to government coercion. \nThe risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country \nhas an authoritarian government, a family member is associated with or dependent \nupon the government, or the country is known to conduct intelligence operations against \nthe U.S. Also very important is whether the foreign country is associated with a risk of \nterrorism. \n \nMost of Applicant and his wife\u2019s family are now U.S. citizens; the remaining are \npermanent residents. His future clearly lies in the U.S. He and his wife have three \nchildren born in the U.S. and another on the way. He is a valued and trusted employee. \nThe potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress based upon Applicant\u2019s \nremaining ties to Russia and Ukraine are insufficient to raise a trustworthiness concern.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a public trust position. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has mitigated the trustworthiness concerns arising from his Foreign \nPreference and Foreign Influence.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline C:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline B:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.e: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n8 ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd.

Duffy, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n__________ \n \nDecision \n__________ \n \n \nRIVERA, Juan J., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant failed to mitigate criminal conduct, personal conduct, and sexual \nbehavior security concerns. Moreover, he falsified his security clearance application. \nEligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn May 7, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as \namended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, \n1992, as amended, modified and revised.1 The SOR alleges security concerns under \n \n1  On Aug. 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a memorandum \ndirecting application of revised Adjudicative Guideline to all adjudications and other determinations made \nunder the Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program \n(Regulation), dated Jan. 1987, as amended, in which the SOR was issued on or after Sep. 1, 2006. \nNovember 13, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                                                                                                            \nGuideline J (Criminal Conduct), Guideline E (Personal Conduct), and Guideline D \n(Sexual Behavior). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the \npreliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for him, and recommended \nreferral to an administrative judge to determine whether his clearance should be denied \nor revoked. \n \nOn June 2, 2008, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations (Answer), and \nelected to have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing (Item 4). A \ncomplete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM), dated August 21, 2008, was \nprovided to him, and he was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit \nmaterial in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant received the FORM on \nAugust 27, 2008. He failed to provide an answer to the FORM within the 30-day period \nprovided, filed no objections, and provided no additional information. The case was \nassigned to me on October 24, 2008. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his Answer, Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 2.a, and denied SOR \u00b6 1.b. \nHe failed to specifically admit or deny SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b, 3.a and 3.b. Based on his Answer\u2019s \nexplanations, I considered SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b, 3.a, and 3.b to be contested. His admissions \nare incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the \nevidence of record, I make the following additional findings of fact.   \n \nApplicant is a 49-year-old quality assurance manager working for a government \ncontractor.2 He served in the U.S. Air Force on active duty from 1978 to 1998. He \nretired with the rank of Technical Sergeant, pay grade E-6. His service was \ncharacterized as honorable (Answer). In 1995, Applicant received access to classified \ninformation at the secret level. Apparently, he has continued to have that same access \nto classified information until 2008. \n \nHe married his wife in 1980. He disclosed no children in his SF 86; however, in \nhis answer to the SOR Applicant indicated he has a teenage son. In 2000, he was hired \nby his current employer, a defense contractor, and apparently has been working for that \nsame employer since. In 2002, Applicant received a Master\u2019s degree. \n \nOn April 11, 2001, Applicant was observed by three police officers with his pants \ndown while he was being masturbated by another man in a port-a-potty located in a \npublic park. Applicant was arrested and charged with Engaging in Lewd Act in a Public \nPlace (Item 8). Applicant pled Nolo Contendere to the charge, was convicted, and paid \na $1,200 fine (Item 6, Answer). \n \n \n \n2  Item 5 is the source for the facts in this paragraph, unless stated otherwise. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                           \n \n \n \nOn April 13, 2005, Applicant submitted a Security Clearance Application (SF \n86).3 Question 26 asked whether in the last seven years Applicant had been arrested \nfor, charged with, or convicted of any offenses not listed in response to other questions \nin the security clearance application. Applicant answered \u201cNo\u201d to question 26, and \ndeliberately failed to disclose his May 2001 arrest, charge, and conviction for Engaging \nin Lewd Act in a Public Place. Instead of disclosing the May 2001 incident, he disclosed \nhe received a municipal ticket in 2000.  \n \nDuring a follow up background interview in January 2006, Applicant was \nconfronted by a government investigator about his failure to disclose his May 2001 \narrest, charge, and conviction. In his statement to the government investigator, \nApplicant denied ever exposing his genitals or engaging in a lewd act (Item 6).4 \nApplicant explained he went to the park and staged the situation because he wanted to \nbe arrested and placed in jail. Applicant claimed he wanted to be placed in jail so that \nhe could take revenge against a teenager who was in jail for stabbing and assaulting \nApplicant\u2019s son. Applicant is ashamed of his arrest for Engaging in a Lewd Act, and he \nhas told no one of this incident. \n \nIn his June 2008 answer to the SOR, Applicant reaffirmed his January 2006 \nstatement to a government investigator. Applicant specifically admitted he did not fully \ndisclose all the material facts in his response to question 26. He listed the municipal \nticket instead of the correct charge because he was embarrassed and did not want his \npeers or his employer\u2019s administrative personnel to find out he was charged with \nEngaging in Lewd Act in a Public Place in May 2001. He denied ever exposing his \ngenitals or engaging on a lewd act. \n \nThe government alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b that Applicant was a suspect in a \nSeptember 2003 assault and battery incident. Police crime reports show that in \nSeptember 17, 2003, two teenagers reported that an unknown man pushed one of the \nteenagers into the teenager\u2019s car and threatened to \u201ckick his ass\u201d (Item 7). The \nteenagers reported the incident to the police and provided enough information to track \ndown the assailant\u2019s car. The car was later identified as belonging to Applicant. One of \nthe teenagers identified Applicant as the perpetrator in a photographic lineup conducted \nby a police officer. According to the police report, the teenager victim filed a complaint \nagainst Applicant, which was to be forwarded to the city attorneys. There is no further \ninformation about the disposition of the alleged complaint or possible charge. In his \nanswer to the SOR, Applicant denied the allegation and stated he had no knowledge of \nany assault charge ever filed against him.  \n \n \n3  Item 5.  \n \n4  Item 6 is the source for the facts in this paragraph unless otherwise stated. \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                           \nPolicies \n \n \nThe purpose of a security clearance decision is to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information.5 \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s controlling \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nIn the decision-making process, the Government has the initial burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d6 \ndemonstrating, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information. \nOnce the Government has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, \nthe burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \n \n5  See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \n \n6  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable \nmind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit \nAuth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                           \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \nGovernment. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).7 \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \n \nUnder Guideline J, the security concern is that criminal activity \u201ccreates doubt \nabout a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into \nquestion a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\u201d AG \n\u00b6 30.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s arrest, charge, and subsequent conviction for Engaging in Lewd \nAct/Public Place triggers the applicability of AG \u00b6 31(c): \u201callegation or admission of \ncriminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally \nprosecuted, or convicted.\u201d \n \nI also find that Applicant falsified his security clearance application (See \ndiscussion under Guideline E, infra). The Government did not allege the falsification \nunder Guideline J. Thus, the falsification of the security clearance cannot be used as \ngrounds to deny Applicant\u2019s application under Guideline J. However, I am required to \nconsider Applicant\u2019s overall questionable behavior when evaluating the seriousness of \nthe conduct alleged in the SOR to determine factors such as the extent to which his \nbehavior is recent; the likelihood of recurrence; Applicant\u2019s explanations concerning the \ncircumstances of the incidents alleged; and his rehabilitation.8 \n \n7  \u201cThe Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and \nunfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the \nDirective, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006). \n \n8  ISCR Case No. 04-09959 at 3 (App. Bd. May 19, 2006). \n\n \n6 \n \n \nConcerning SOR \u00b6 1.b (assault in September 2003), I find the government \nproduced substantial evidence to support this allegation. AG \u00b6 31(c): \u201callegation or \nadmission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, \nformally prosecuted, or convicted,\u201d applies. However, the security concern is mitigated \nunder AG \u00b6 32(c): \u201cevidence that the person did not commit the offense.\u201d No other \nmitigating conditions apply. \n \nPersonal Conduct  \n \nUnder Guideline E, conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, \ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified \ninformation. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers \nduring the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security \nclearance process. AG \u00b6 15. \n \nApplicant omitted relevant, material information in his answer to Question 26 of \nhis security clearance application. Considering the record as a whole, I am convinced \nApplicant deliberately omitted the information. Numerous factors weighed in my analysis \nto reach that conclusion, including: Applicant\u2019s age, his level of education, and his years \nof military service and in his current job. More importantly, Applicant admitted he was so \nembarrassed about his May 2001 sexual behavior, that he falsified his SF 86 to prevent \nhis peers and employer\u2019s administrative assistant from finding out about his behavior. \n \nI also find Applicant made a false statement to the government investigator in \nJanuary 2006. Applicant denied ever exposing his genitals or engaging in a lewd act. \nThe April 2001 police report indicates three police officers observed Applicant while he \nwas being masturbated. He pled Nolo Contendere to the charge of Engaging in a Lewd \nAct/Public Place. Applicant\u2019s explanation -- that he staged the situation because he \nwanted to be arrested and placed in jail to take revenge against a teenager who \nattacked his son \u2013 is not credible. Applicant falsified his SF 86 to cover his \nembarrassment for the May 2001 charge. It is difficult to believe someone of his age, \nlevel of education, and military service experience would have chosen such an \nembarrassing charge (to him) to get arrested.  \n \nDisqualifying conditions AG \u00b6 16(a): \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or \nfalsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire;\u201d AG \u00b6 16(b): \n\u201cdeliberately providing false of misleading information concerning relevant facts to an . . \n. investigator;\u201d and AG \u00b6 16(e): \u201cpersonal conduct, or concealment of information about \none\u2019s conduct, that creates vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s personal, \nprofessional, or community standing,\u201d apply. \n \nI considered all seven mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17, and find that none \napplies. Applicant\u2019s sparse favorable information fails to justify the applicability of any of \nthe mitigating conditions. \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \nSexual Behavior \n \n  \nUnder AG \u00b6 12 the government concern is that: \n \nSexual behaviour that involves a criminal offense, indicates a personality \nor emotional disorder, reflects lack of judgment or discretion, or which may \nsubject the individual to undue influence or coercion, exploitation, or \nduress can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness \nand ability to protect classified information. No adverse inference \nconcerning the standards in this Guideline may be raised solely on the \nbasis of the sexual orientation of the individual. \n \n \nApplicant engaged in a lewd act in a public place. He was prosecuted and pled \nNolo Contendere to Engaging in a Lewd Act/Public Place. He is so embarrassed about \nthe charge that he has told no one about it. Moreover, he falsified his SF 86 to prevent \nhis peers and others from finding out about the charge. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s behavior triggers the applicability of three sexual behavior \ndisqualifying conditions: AG \u00b6 13(a): \u201csexual behavior of a criminal nature;\u201d AG \u00b6 13(c): \n\u201csexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, of \nduress;\u201d and AG \u00b6 13(d): \u201csexual behavior of a public nature and/or that reflects lack of \ndiscretion or judgment.\u201d \n \n \nI considered all four mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 14, and find that none \napplies. Applicant\u2019s sparse favorable information fails to fully justify the applicability of \nany of the mitigating conditions. I specifically considered AG \u00b6 14(b): \u201cthe sexual \nbehavior happened so long ago, so infrequent, or under such unusual circumstances, \nthat it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment,\u201d and AG \u00b6 14(c): \u201cthe behavior no longer serves as \na basis for coercion, exploitation, or duress,\u201d and I find they do not apply.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s questionable sexual behavior occurred seven years ago, and could \nbe considered temporally remote. However, his falsification of the SF 86 brings to the \nforefront the security concerns raised under the sexual behavior guideline. It shows \nApplicant is still vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or duress because of his \nembarrassment. Moreover, considering Applicant\u2019s behavior as a whole, it casts doubts \non Applicant\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \n \n \nConcerning SOR \u00b6 3.b, I find for Applicant in the decretal paragraph of this \ndecision because SOR \u00b6 3.b duplicates the allegation in SOR \u00b6 3.a. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \n\n \n8 \n \n \n                                           \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c).   \nApplicant receives favorable credit for his 20-years of honorable service to his \ncountry, his educational achievements, and his years of employment by a government \ncontractor. Applicant was convicted of a misdemeanor seven years ago, and his \nbehavior, if among consenting, discrete adults would not have been considered as a \nsecurity concern.9 \n \nThe evidence against mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct is more substantial. His \nsexual behaviour was of a public nature and reflects lack of discretion and judgment. He \naggravated his situation by omitting information from his SF 86 and his statement to the \ngovernment investigator. Applicant\u2019s falsification is directly related to his desire to hide \nhis embarrassing 2001 sexual behaviour. Because he is embarrassed and afraid that \nany of his peers or co-workers find out about his past behaviour, the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress exists and it is likely it would continue to \nexist. His statement about why he staged his arrest is not credible and this failure to be \ncandid raises additional security concerns. \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and \ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude he has not mitigated the \nsecurity concerns pertaining to criminal conduct, personal conduct, and sexual \nbehavior.    \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \n9  See Executive Order 12968, Access to Classified Information, dated August 2, 1995, \nSubsections 3.1(c) (The U.S. Government does not discriminate on the basis of . . . sexual orientation), \nand 3.1(d) (No inference . . . may be raised solely on the basis of the sexual orientation of the employee). \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:   \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:    \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a & 2.b: \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline D:    \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 3.b:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security \nclearance for Applicant.

MOGUL\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nEmilio Jaksetic, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant has used marijuana and psilocybin mushrooms for many years until as recently as\n2005. Additionally, she has had a history of alcohol abuse that has continued as recently as March\n2006, and she continues to regularly consume alcohol. No credible, independent evidence was\noffered to prove Applicant\u2019s rehabilitation.  Mitigation has not been shown. Clearance is denied.\n\n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn March 8, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 (as amended) and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated\nJanuary 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) (Exhibit 1)  to the Applicant, which detailed\nreasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it\nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant\nand recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be\ndenied or revoked.\nApplicant  filed a notarized response, dated March 28, 2007, to the allegations set forth in\nthe SOR, (Exhibit 3). She requested that his case be decided on the written record in lieu of a\nhearing. \nOn April 12, 2007,  Department Counsel prepared the Department's written case. A complete\ncopy of the File of Relevant Material (FORM) was provided to Applicant, and she was given the\nopportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant\nfiled a response to the FORM which was received on May 16, 2007. The case was assigned to this\nAdministrative Judge on May 24, 2007.\nDepartment Counsel offered 10 documentary exhibits (Exhibits 1-10), and Applicant offered\none documentary exhibit, a one page response to the FORM (Exhibit A). All exhibits have been\nadmitted into evidence without objection. \n \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nIn the SOR, the Government alleges that a security risk may exist under Adjudicative\nGuideline H (Drug Involvement) and  Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption) of the Directive. The\nSOR contains four allegations, 1.a., through 1.d., under Guideline H and one allegation, 2.a., under\nGuideline G. Applicant admitted all the SOR allegations, with a partial denial under 1.d. The\nadmitted allegations are incorporated herein as findings of fact. \nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including Applicant's\nAnswer to the SOR, the FORM, and the admitted documents, and upon due consideration of that\nevidence, I make the additional findings of fact: \nApplicant is 26 years old. She is employed as an interior designer by a defense contractor,\nand she seeks a DoD security clearance in connection with her employment in the defense sector.\nShe is not married and has no children (Exhibit 4).\nParagraph 1 (Guideline H - Drug Involvement) \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because\n\n3\nshe has abused illegal substances. \nApplicant has admitted using marijuana approximately 100 times during the period from\nMarch 2000 through April 2005. She engaged in the illegal purchase of the marijuana that she used.\nApplicant also used psilocybin mushrooms from March 2000 through April 2005. Finally, she used\nthe United States  postal service to mail marijuana that she purchased outside of the U.S. (Exhibits\n1, 3, A).\nShe claims that since May 2005, when she graduated college, she no longer uses illegal\nsubstances ans she does not intend to use them in the future (Exhibits 3, A).   \nParagraph 2 (Guideline G - Alcohol Consumption). \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance\nbecause she abuses alcohol to excess.\nApplicant has admitted consuming alcohol to the point of impaired judgement from the age\nof 20 through March 2006 (Exhibits 3, 6). \nShe claims that she has now modified her drinking behavior, and although she now drinks\ntwo to three glasses of wine or cocktails per week, she does not drink to the point of impaired\njudgement and does not intend to abuse alcohol in the future (Exhibits 3, A). \nPOLICIES\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum. Accordingly, the Department of\nDefense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992 Directive, has set forth policy factors which must be given\n\"binding\" consideration in making security clearance determinations. These factors should be\nfollowed in every case according to the pertinent guideline. However, the factors are neither\nautomatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative\nJudge's reliance on his own common sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature and\nthe ways of the world, in making a reasoned decision. Because each security clearance case presents\nits own unique facts and circumstances, it cannot be assumed that these factors exhaust the realm\nof human experience, or apply equally in every case.\nAs set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17, \"In evaluating the relevance of\nan individual's conduct, the [Administrative Judge] should consider the following factors [General\nFactors]:\na. The nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct\nb. The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation\nc. The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd. The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne. The voluntariness of participation\nf. The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes\n\n4\ng. The motivation for the conduct\nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\ni. The likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe eligibility guidelines established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics\nand conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question of whether it is \"clearly consistent\nwith the national interest\" to grant an Applicant's request for access to classified information.\nIn the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian\nworkers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information twenty-four hours a day.\nThe Government is therefore appropriately concerned where available information indicates that an\nApplicant for clearance may be involved in acts of alcohol abuse and criminal conduct that\ndemonstrates poor judgement, untrustworthiness or unreliability on the Applicant's part.\nThe DoD Directive states, \"Each adjudication is to be an overall common sense\ndetermination based upon consideration and assessment of all available information, both favorable\nand unfavorable, with particular emphasis placed on the seriousness, recency, frequency, and\nmotivation for the individual's conduct; the extent to which conduct was negligent, willful,\nvoluntary, or undertaken with the knowledge of the circumstances or consequences involved; and,\nto the extent that it can be estimated, the probability that conduct will or will not continue in the\nfuture.\" The Administrative Judge can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have a\nreasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record. The Judge cannot draw inferences or\nconclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature. Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \"Any determination under this order...shall be\na determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the\nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\"\nCONCLUSIONS\nIt is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding\nof a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant's conduct and the continued holding of a\nsecurity clearance. If such a case has been established, the burden then shifts to the Applicant to go\nforward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome or\noutweigh the Government's case. The Applicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving\nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him or her a security clearance.\nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate legal\nprecepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly above, I conclude the following\nwith respect to the allegation set forth in the SOR:\nIn this case, the Government has met its initial burden of proving by substantial evidence that\nApplicant has used illegal drugs (Guideline H) and that she used alcohol to excess (Guideline G).\nApplicant, on the other hand, has not introduced persuasive evidence in rebuttal, explanation or\nmitigation which is sufficient to overcome the Government's case against her. \n\n5\nSince this matter is being decided without a hearing, my evaluation is necessarily limited to\nthe contents of the various documents that are found in the case file. Applicant has submitted\ndocuments, in which she avers that she will no longer use illegal drugs or consume alcohol to excess.\nHowever,  when I consider the recency and frequency of her marijuana usage and her alcohol abuse,\ncombined with the fact that no independent evidence was offered to prove Applicant\u2019s rehabilitation,\nI find that it is too soon to determine that Applicant\u2019s lifestyle and behavior have changed\nsufficiently to establish that she would not fall into the pattern of drug use and alcohol abuse in the\nfuture.\n(Guideline H - Drug Involvement) \nWith respect to Guideline H, the Government has established its case. Applicant's improper\nand illegal drug abuse, including the use of marijuana, is of concern, especially in light of her desire\nto have access to the nation's secrets.  Applicant's overall conduct pertaining to her illegal substance\nabuse clearly falls within Drug Involvement Disqualifying Condition  DC25 (a), any drug abuse, and\nDC (c), illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or\ndistribution.\nBased on the recency and frequency of the marijuana usage and lack of  independent evidence\nof rehabilitation, as discussed above,  I cannot conclude that Applicant\u2019s conduct can apply to any\nof the Mitigating Conditions (MC) at this time.\nIn this case, the Government has met its initial burden of proving by substantial evidence that\nApplicant used illegal drugs for many years under Guideline H. Applicant, has not introduced\nsufficient, credible evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation.  Accordingly, Paragraph 1,\nGuideline H, is concluded against  Applicant.\n(Guideline G -Alcohol Consumption) \nApplicant has consumed alcohol to the point of intoxication for a period of approximately\nsix years , as recently as March 2006.  While she has averred that she will not overuse alcohol in the\nfuture, she continues to imbibe alcoholic beverages on a regular basis, as described above.  \nThe Government established that DC 22 (c) applies, Applicant has engaged in habitual or\nbinge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment.  Applicant has not demonstrated\ncredible evidence to support a conclusion that she has reformed her habit and no longer consumes\nalcohol to excess. Therefore, I cannot conclude that any MC is applicable to Guideline G. Paragraph\n2 is found against Applicant.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nParagraph 1.

DeLaney, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nApril 1, 2008\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMOGUL, Martin H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted two Questionnaires for Public Trust Position (SF 85P) on\nJanuary 27, 2003, and April 15, 2005. On October 30, 2007, the Defense Office of\nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the\ntrustworthiness concerns under Guidelines C and B for Applicant. The action was taken\nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive); Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel\nSecurity Program, dated Jan. 1987, as amended (Regulation); and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant responded to the SOR (RSOR) in writing on November 16, 2007, and\nrequested a decision by an Administrative Judge on the written record in lieu of a\nhearing.  The case was assigned to this Administrative Judge on March 20, 2008.\nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for\naccess to sensitive information is denied.\n\n2\nOn January 30, 2008, Department Counsel prepared the Department's written\ncase. A complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) was provided to\nApplicant, and she was given the opportunity to file objections and submit material in\nrefutation, extenuation, or mitigation. A response was due on March 20, 2008.\nIn the FORM, Department Counsel offered 11 documentary exhibits\n(Items 1-11).  Applicant timely submitted an additional document that has been\nidentified and entered into evidence without objection as Item A.\nRequest for Administrative Notice\nIn the FORM, Department Counsel submitted a request that I take administrative\nnotice of certain facts relating to the country of Russia. The facts administratively\nnoticed are set out in the Findings of Fact, below.\n \nFindings of Fact\nIn the SOR, the Government alleges concern under Adjudicative Guideline C\n(Foreign Preference (FP)) and B (Foreign Influence (FI)) of the Directive. The SOR\ncontains 1 allegation, 1.a., under Guideline C and four allegations, 2.a, through 2.d.,\nunder Guideline B. In her RSOR, Applicant admitted SOR allegations 2.a, through 2.d.\nShe denied allegation 1.a. The admitted allegations are incorporated herein as findings\nof fact. \nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including\nApplicant's RSOR, the FORM, the admitted documents, and upon due consideration of\nthat evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact: \nApplicant is 38 years old, and was born in the Soviet Union (now Russia). She\nmoved to the United States in 1998, and she became a naturalized United States\ncitizen in 2004. She remains a dual citizen of Russia and the United States, but she\nindicated in an affidavit that she executed in January 2007 (Item 9) that she is willing to\nrenounce her Russian  citizenship, if it is required for her current position.  Applicant is\nmarried, and her husband is also a dual citizen of Russia and the United States.\nApplicant and her husband have two children, one of whom was born in Russia, and is\na Russian citizen, and the other in the United States.\nApplicant attended medical school in Russia from 1988 to 1993, and she was a\npracticing physician before moving to the United States.\n Applicant is currently a Software Developer for a defense contractor who seeks\nan ADP-I/II/III position on her behalf.  \nCurrent Status of Russia\nI take administrative notice of the following facts regarding Russia. Currently,\nRussia consists of a strong president, a prime minister, a bicameral legislature, and a\n\n3\nweak judiciary. Russia in a nuclear superpower that, since the dissolution of the Soviet\nUnion, continues to develop politically, socially, and economially.  \nRussia has an active, recent and ongoing collection program targeting the United\nStates. As of 2005, Russia and China were the most aggressive collectors of sensitive\nand protected U.S. technology and accounted for the majority of such targeting.\nRussia\u2019s collection efforts targeting the United States likely will continue and will focus\non obtaining commercial or dual-use technology. \nFinally, Russia\u2019s internal problems include terrorism and a problematic human\nrights record. United States citizens, who are former Russian citizens, may be viewed in\nRussia as Russian citizens and not be allowed to leave Russia except on a Russian\npassport.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline C - Foreign Preference) \n1.a. It is alleged in the SOR that Applicant possessed a Russian passport, that\nwas issued on April 29, 2003, and is not scheduled to expire until April 29, 2008. In her\nRSOR (Item 3). Applicant stated that she had \u201csurrendered (her) passport to the\ncompany\u2019s facility security officer.\u201d Additionally, she submitted a letter dated March 6,\n2008, (Item A) in which her employer\u2019s Security Facility Officer (FSO) wrote that\nApplicant surrendered her Russian passport to her on November 6, 2007, and it is\nbeing kept \u201cin the personnel file of [Applicant] under lock and key.\u201d  She added that \u201cif\nthere should be any change to the Status of where this passport is being held, it will be\nreported immediately to the Department of Defense.\u201d\nParagraph 2 (Guideline B - Foreign Influence) \n2.a. Applicant's mother is a citizen of Russia, and she resides with Applicant in\nthe United States. Applicant has no brothers or sisters, and her father is deceased. \n2.b. Applicant's grandmother is a citizen and resident of Russia. In an Affidavit\nmade and signed by Applicant on July 8, 2003, (Item 10) she stated that she has\ncontact with her grandmother one time every two weeks. That is the only evidence in\nthe file about Applicant\u2019s relationship with her grandmother. \n2.c. Applicant intends to visit her grandmother in Russia in the future.\n2.d. Applicant traveled to Russia in 2003 to visit her relatives that lived there. \nPolicies\nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d\n(See Regulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.)  \u201cThe standard that must be met for\n. . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the\nperson\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to\nsensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d (See\n\n4\nRegulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1.) The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence\nand Security) Memorandum, dated November 19, 2004, indicates trustworthiness\nadjudications will apply to cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense Security Service\nand Office of Personnel Management.  Department of Defense contractor personnel\nare afforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any final\nunfavorable access determination may be made. (See Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.)  \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the\nAG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\n[sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable\ntrustworthiness decision. \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nsensitive information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin\nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty\nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple\nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).  \n\n5\nAnalysis\nGuideline C, Foreign Preference\nUnder AG \u00b6 9 the security concern involving foreign preference arises, \u201c[W]hen\nan individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over\nthe United States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or make\ndecisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s application and receipt of a Russian passport raises foreign\npreference concerns under Disqualifying Condition DC 10 (a), the exercise of the\nprivilege of foreign citizenship.\nHowever, Applicant did invalidate her foreign passport, by turning it over to her\nFSO, who maintains it in the company safe.  Additionally, she has indicated a\nwillingness to renounce her Russian citizenship to the proper authorities, Therefore, I\nfind that Mitigating Conditions (MC) (b) and (e) under this guideline apply to this case.\nAfter considering all of the evidence of record on Guideline C, I conclude that the\nmitigating evidence substantially outweighs the disqualifying evidence. \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence\nAG \u00b6 6 expresses the security concern regarding foreign influence: \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual has\ndivided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or induced to help a\nforeign person, group, organization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests,\nor is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication under this\nGuideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign country in which the\nforeign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such\nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United States citizens\nto obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism.\nBased on the evidence of record, the Government has established an initial\nreason to deny Applicant a security clearance because of Guideline B (Foreign\nInfluence). Applicant\u2019s mother and grandmother are citizens of Russia, and her\ngrandmother resides in Russia, which could create the potential for foreign influence\nthat could result in the compromise of classified information because it makes Applicant\npotentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure. The possession of such ties\nraises a security concern sufficient to require Applicant to present evidence in rebuttal,\nextenuation, or mitigation sufficient to meet her burden of persuasion that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for her.\nIn reviewing the Disqualifying Conditions (DC) I find that DC 7 (a) applies,\ncontact with foreign family members, who are citizens and residents in a foreign\ncountry, if that contact creates heightened risk of foreign exploitation, pressure or\ncoercion. Since Applicant\u2019s mother resides with her in the United States, I do not find it\n\n6\nsecurity significant that she continues to be a Russian citizen.   However, Applicants\u2019s\ngrandmother continues to reside in Russia. The only information that can be\nascertained about Applicant\u2019s relationship with her grandmother is that Applicant visited\nher in 2003, and she intends to visit her again in Russia in the future.  Also, as of 2003,\nApplicant contacted her grandmother one time a week. \nI can not find that any MC applies in this case under Guideline B, since there\nsimply has been insufficient evidence introduced to make a determination of the nature\nof the relationship of Applicant with her grandmother, or to determine Applicant\u2019s\nrelationships and loyalties with the United States compared to her sense of loyalty or\nobligation to her grandmother.  \n \nAccordingly, I find Guideline B against Applicant.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the\nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should\nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature,\nextent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct,\nto include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;\n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a public trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon\ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. \nOverall, the record evidence is insufficient to make a favorable finding as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a public trust position under the whole person\nconcept. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the\ntrustworthiness concerns arising from her foreign influence. \n\n7\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline C:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline B:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust\nposition. Eligibility for access to sensitive information is denied.\nMartin H. Mogul\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On October 22, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guidelines\nF and E for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on October 29, 2007, and elected to\nhave his case decided on the record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted\nthe Government\u2019s written case on January 8, 2008. Applicant received a complete file of\nrelevant material (FORM) on January 15, 2008, and was provided the opportunity to file\nFebruary 29, 2008\n\nThe Government submitted twelve items in support of its contentions.\n1\nItem 3 (Applicant\u2019s answer to SOR).\n2\nApplicant\u2019s Response to FORM with attachments.\n3\nItem 4 (Security Clearance Questionnaire, dated February 4, 2005).\n4\nApplicant\u2019s Sworn Response to Form, dated February 13, 2008).\n5\nItem 6 (Applicant\u2019s Response to DOHA Interrogatories).\n6\n2\nobjections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government\u2019s case.1\nApplicant submitted additional information on February 13, 2008. The case was\nassigned to me on February 21, 2008. Based upon a review of the case file, eligibility\nfor access to classified information is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated November 19, 2007, Applicant admitted the\nfactual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.h, of the SOR, with explanations. He also admitted the\nfactual allegations in \u00b6 2.a- 2.b of the SOR but denied any intentional falsification.  He\n2\nprovided additional information to support his request for eligibility for a security\nclearance.  \n3\nApplicant is a 46-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He attended college\nand is currently enrolled in a graduate program. He is married with two children. He has\nworked for his current employer since June 2004.4\nApplicant served in the military from 1981 until 2002. He retired from the U.S. Air\nForce in November 2002. In that same year, Applicant petitioned for divorce from his\nfirst wife in August 2002. During his marriage he worked for at least three additional\nemployers so that he could pay his bills. His first wife could not maintain stable\nemployment. She opened various credit card accounts in her name without his\nknowledge. He supported his family and paid as many debts as possible. However, he\nwas the sole source of income for the family of four.5\nAfter the separation, Applicant voluntarily provided financial support for his\nyounger son who was living with his wife. In addition to the legal expenses from the\ndivorce and the loss of income, he incurred additional expenses. He moved to off base\nhousing and had more expensive living expenses. He gained employment after his\nretirement, but his income decreased from $47,992 to $40,927. He was not able to pay\nall his obligations.  Moreover, his ex-wife was entitled to a percentage (42%) of his\n6\nretirement income.\nApplicant\u2019s new employment in 2004 necessitated a move to a state with higher\nliving costs. He was paid $5,000 in alimony and $758 for child support monthly as a\n\nAttachment -  with Applicant\u2019s Response to FORM.\n7\nAlthough not an allegation in the SOR, Applicant noted that he is also paying a monthly amount to the\n8\nIRS for 2006 tax debt. He documented his payment plan.\nItem 4 (Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR).\n9\nItem 5 (Credit Bureau Report for Applicant, dated May 31, 2007).\n10\nThe amount listed on the SOR for 1.e is $1,313. However, it was settled by Applicant for the lower\n11\namount.\nId.\n12\nAttachment 1-12 with Response to FORM.\n13\nAttachment to Response to Form.\n14\n3\nresult of the final divorce decree in 2005.  Thus, the other delinquent accounts could not\n7\nbe addressed immediately. In addition, he was taxed at a single rate and his monthly\nnet income was less than $3,000.8\nApplicant remarried in 2006.  His second wife was in graduate school and not\n9\nemployed. From December 2006 until September 2007, Applicant was the sole earner.\nThis resulted in his negative net monthly remainder reflected in the first personal\nfinancial statement he submitted. \nThe SOR alleges seven delinquent debts ($10,160). The total amount of debt\nthat Applicant owes is approximately $6,918.  Applicant asserts that the account in\n10\nallegation \u00b6 1.a for $570 was transferred to an active credit card. This is the same debt\nalleged in \u00b6 1.f. For several allegations, including allegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, and 1.d, Applicant\nprovided proof that he paid the accounts.  The SOR allegation in \u00b6 1.c for $5,271 is a\n11\ncharged off account.  Allegation \u00b6 1.e for $1,313 is the same as allegation 1.b.\n12\nApplicant states the debt in \u00b6 1.g for $1,947 is a charged off account for his wife\u2019s car.\nHowever, through a divorce decree, his ex-wife is responsible for the debt. Thus,\nApplicant believes he has four delinquent debts.\nThe current status of Applicant four delinquent debts is as follows: Two debts are\npaid in full ( 1.b and 1.d). Two debts are in a payment plan (1.a and 1.c). Applicant\nproduced detailed documentation showing his payments and his established repayment\nplans.13\nApplicant\u2019s current monthly net income (including his retirement pay) is $4,952.\nHis wife\u2019s net monthly income is $1,714.00 for a total of $6,667.00. After monthly\nexpenses of $4,639.40, and debt payments of $468, he has a net remainder of\n$1,559.70.  His wife gained employment in September 2007. Applicant provided a\n14\ndetailed annotation explaining the differences from his earlier personal financial\nstatement that indicated his negative cash flow.\n\nAttachment - Letter of Reference, dated February 13, 2008.\n15\n4\nOn his February 23, 2005, security clearance questionnaire, Applicant answered\n\u201cno\u201d to Section 38. Your Financial Delinquencies. The response indicated he was not\nmore than 180 days delinquent on any debt. He stated he was confused by the\nquestion. He admits answering them incorrectly but he had no intent to deliberately\nconceal information. He thought the questions referred to active debt and monthly\naccounts. He did answer \u201cyes\u201d to Section 39 and listed his school grant obligation.\nHowever, his student loan is deferred according to his credit report. \nApplicant\u2019s current employer praised him for his positive attitude, integrity, high\nmoral foundation and high degree of customer support. He is very respected by\ncustomers and his team.15\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2,\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \n\nIn Applicant\u2019s March 2007 personal financial statement his monthly net income was - $147.96. This might\n16\narguably raise 19(e),(consistent spending beyond one\u2019s means, which may be indicated by excessive\nindebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high-debt-to-income ration, and/or other financial analysis).\nHowever, this was one isolated statement, Applicant has provided a 2008 statement showing a positive\nnet. \n5\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated delinquent debt and was unable to pay some\nobligations for a period of time. His credit reports confirm that he has not paid the\naccounts. The activity for the delinquent debts ranges from 2002 until the present. The\nevidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer\nexamination.16\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\n\n6\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s\nfinancial worries arose in 2002. He accumulated some delinquent debt due to his\nretirement, separation and divorce. While those circumstances may have precipitated\nthe debt, the inquiry does not end at that point. He acted responsibly by providing for his\nchildren. He paid whatever debt he could. He has shown determination and character\nafter his separation and divorce. His conduct over the last six months with his creditors\nremove security concerns or doubts about his current reliability, trustworthiness, and\ngood judgment. The circumstances are not likely to recur as he is remarried and has\nstable employment. This potentially mitigating condition applies. \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ As noted above, all of\nhis financial problems arose from his separation, divorce, retirement and lower salary.\nHe was the sole provider for his family. He acted responsibly in identifying and resolving\nthese debts. I find this potentially mitigating condition is a factor for consideration in this\ncase. \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the\nevidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant has not received counseling according to the record,\nbut he has been active in resolving his delinquent debts, either by payment or\nsettlement. He is now financially sound and prepared for future contingencies. I\nconclude these potentially mitigating conditions apply.\nAG \u00b6 20(e) applies where the evidence shows \u201cthe individual has a reasonable\nbasis to dispute the legitimacy of the past due debt which is the cause of the problem\nand provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.\u201d In this case, Applicant produced\ndocumentation in the divorce decree that supported his claim that his ex-wife took\nresponsibility for the debt alleged in SOR 1.g in the amount of $1,947. However, this is\nstill legally his debt. I conclude this potentially mitigating condition partially applies.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in\nAG \u00b6 15:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an\n\n7\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Of\nspecial interest is any failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG \u00b6 16(a), \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any\npersonnel questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct\ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities\u201d is potentially disqualifying.\nIn this case, Applicant did not consider them delinquent at that point in time but\nrather active debt and monthly accounts. To support this contention, the student loan\ndebt in deferment was listed in answer to question 39. He did not intentionally falsify his\nsecurity clearance application. \nUnder 16(a), the government established that he omitted a material fact from his\nanswer to Section 38. He denied that he deliberately or knowingly falsified an answer to\nhis security clearance questionnaire and that he answered to the best of his knowledge.\nWhen a falsification allegation is controverted, the government has the burden of\nproving it. Proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove an\nApplicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the omission occurred. An administrative judge\nmust consider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or\ncircumstantial evidence regarding an Applicant\u2019s state of mind at the time the omission\noccurred. The government has not established that Applicant deliberately falsified his\nanswer to Questions 38 and 39. \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant served in the military for\nalmost 21 years, and retired in 2001. Applicant married and supported his family during\nthat time. When these problems first began, Applicant was going through a separation\n\n8\nand divorce in 2002. He accumulated debt due to circumstances largely beyond his\ncontrol, including sporadic employment and low income after his retirement from the\nmilitary. As a result, he has focused his attention on providing a stable domestic\nenvironment for his family. He presented substantial extenuating and mitigating\nevidence. His financial difficulties resulted from a contentious divorce. He is paying all\ndelinquent debts using a payment plan. The absence of any evidence of any prior\nviolation of his employer\u2019s rules or requirements, his candid admissions concerning his\ndebts, and his promise to continue his future financial progress weigh in his favor. The\nlikelihood of recurrence is low. He is making payments. His wife is working. Most\nimportant, their overall financial situation has improved with the increase in family\nincome. He has taken affirmative action to pay or resolve most of the delinquent debt\u2019s\nraising concerns about his good judgment.  Of course, the issue is not simply whether\nall his debts are paidBit is whether his financial circumstances raise concerns about his\nfitness to hold a security clearance. Applicant has met his burden of proof in this case to\novercome the government\u2019s case. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial\nconsiderations. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h: \nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor Applicant\n\n9\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

She\nhas credit card, medical, house foreclosure and other delinquent debts totaling more than $34,000.\nIt has been more than four years and she has not resolved her delinquent debts. She stated she was\ngoing to have all of her debts discharged in bankruptcy, but no evidence was offered to show the\ndischarge took place. Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns raised by Guideline F,\nfinancial considerations. Clearance is denied. \nSTATEMENT OF CASE\nOn August 30, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to\nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) stating it was unable to find that it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue a security clearance.  The SOR, which is in essence the\n1\nadministrative complaint, alleges security concerns under Guideline F, Financial Considerations.\nIn a sworn statement dated September 12, 2006, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations.\nApplicant elected to have her case decided on the written record. Department Counsel submitted the\ngovernment\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) on December 20, 2006. The FORM was mailed to\nApplicant on December 22, 2006, and received on January 5, 2007. Applicant was afforded an\nopportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant\ndid not provide additional information. The case was assigned to me on March 13, 2007. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant is 42 years old and has worked as a data management specialist for a federal\ncontractor since August 2005. Applicant is divorced and has two sons ages 19 and 13. The elder\nattends college. Applicant has a bachelor of science degree and has taken some additional college\ncourses.\nApplicant and her sons moved from one state to another in 2002. Applicant and another\nsingle mother moved to a new state with an arrangement to split their bills. The other mother moved\nafter two months and Applicant did not have sufficient income to meet her expenses. She admits to\nall of her delinquent debts except those in SOR\u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.k, and 1.q. The debt in SOR \u00b61.b is for an\nelectric bill from where she lived before she moved. She stated she paid it, but did not provide any\ndocumentation. The debt in SOR \u00b61.k is a medical bill for her son. She stated her son was covered\nby medical insurance and the insurance was supposed to pay the bill. She contacted the insurance\ncompany in the past and she stated in her answer to the SOR \u201c[a]pparently it was never reconciled.\u201d\nShe did not provide any additional information as to what she did to attempt to reconcile it. She\ndenies the debt in SOR 1. q stating she paid the debt in 2005. No documents were presented to\ncorroborate her statement. \n\nItem 4 at 35. \n2\nItem 5 at 10-11.\n3\nItem 5 at p. 5. \n4\nId. at 6.\n5\n3\nThe delinquent debts that Applicant admits are for more than $34,600. Her largest debt in\nSOR \u00b61.p, is for $21,263 for a foreclosure on her home when she could not afford to make the\nmortgage payments. She took a home equity loan, rented the house and was attempting to sell it. At\nsome point she no longer had renters and could not sell the home. She contacted the creditor and they\nforeclosed. \nIn August 2005 on her SCA, Applicant stated \u201cI am attempting to clean up my credit and\nresponsibly manage my money and satisfy all outstanding debts to the best of my ability in a timely\nfashion.\u201d  On her credit report dated August 4, 2006, it shows that two new credit card accounts\n2\nwere opened in November 2005 and both are delinquent.  Applicant stated in her August 7, 2006\n3\ninterrogatories: \n\u201cI am in the process of filing Chapter 7 Bankruptcy and will no longer be in debt to\nthe past due creditors. I attempted to go to a credit consolidation company after\nmeeting with the investigator\u2019s representative last year. I could not make the\npayments they were requiring of me. The payments were completely unfeasible for\nme. I had been trying to save money to file for bankruptcy and I finally completed the\nbankruptcy paperwork on August 4, 2006. I will be going to court in September and\nwill be relinquished from the debts I have incurred. I have finally gotten into a\nhousing situation where I will be able to afford my current bills and possibly begin\nworking to rectify my credit score.\u201d4\nApplicant again indicated in her answer to the SOR dated September 12, 2006, \u201cI am in the\nprocess of filing for bankruptcy on the above bills.\u201d She provided a document to show she has made\npayments to a bankruptcy attorney to file a petition, but the payments are not complete. The last\npayment was made on August 4, 2006, and the statement shows a remaining balance of $495.5\nApplicant has not provided any additional information to support that she completed payment\ntowards her bankruptcy filing or that the filing took place, or that her debts have been discharged.\nShe has not provided any information or documentation to support that she has taken any action\ntoward paying her debts\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating\na person\u2019s eligibility to hold a security clearance. Included in the guidelines are disqualifying\nconditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) applicable to each specific guideline. Additionally,\neach security clearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the\nrelevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the factors listed\nin the Directive. Specifically these are: (1) the nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding\n\nISCR Case No. 96-0277 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 11, 1997).\n6\nISCR Case No. 97-0016 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 31, 1997); Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n7\nDepartment of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\n8\nISCR Case No. 94-1075 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, 1995); Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n9\nISCR Case No. 93-1390 at 7-8 (App. Bd. Jan. 27, 1995); Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n10\nEgan, 484 U.S. at 531.\n11\nId.\n12\nId.; Directive, Enclosure 2, \u00b6 E2.2.2.\n13\nExecutive Order 10865 \u00a7 7.\n14\n4\ncircumstances; (2) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (3) the age of the applicant; (4) the\nmotivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary,\nor undertaken with knowledge of the consequences; (5) the absence or presence of rehabilitation; and\n(6) the probability that the circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future. Although\nthe presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome\ndeterminative, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured\nagainst this policy guidance.\nThe sole purpose of a security clearance determination is to decide if it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an applicant.  The government\n6\nhas the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of proof is something less than a\n7\npreponderance of evidence.  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an\n8\napplicant to present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against\nhim.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance\n9\ndecision.  \n10\nNo one has a right to a security clearance  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that\n11\nsecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  Any reasonable\n12\ndoubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved\nin favor of protecting such sensitive information.  The decision to deny an individual a security\n13\nclearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an\n14\nindication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of\nDefense have established for issuing a clearance.\nBased upon consideration of all the evidence, I find the following adjudicative guideline most\npertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case:\nGuideline F-Financial Considerations are a concern because failure or inability to live within\none\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual\n\n5\nwho is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nCompulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes including espionage. Affluence\nthat cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a security concern. It may indicate\nproceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.\nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those\nwhich would mitigate security concerns, pertaining to the adjudicative guideline are set forth and\ndiscussed in the conclusions below. \nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards.\nBased on all of the evidence, Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) FC\nDC E2.A6.1.2.1 (A history of not meeting financial obligations) and FC DC E2.A6.1.2.3 (Inability\nor unwillingness to satisfy debts), apply in this case. Applicant has many delinquent debts that she\nfailed to pay. She stated she intends on filing for bankruptcy, but failed to show her debts have been\ndischarged or that she has taken any action to pay them. She admits she owes most of the debts and\nthey are delinquent.\nI have considered all of the Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC), and\nespecially considered FC MC E2.A6.1.3.1 (The behavior was not recent), FC MC E2.A6.1.3.2. (It\nwas an isolated incident), FC MC E2.A6.1.3.3 (The conditions that resulted in the behavior were\nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected\nmedical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation)), FC MC E2.A6.1.3.4 (The person has\nreceived or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that the problem\nis being resolved or is under control), and FC MC E2.A6.1.3.6 (The individual initiated a good-faith\neffort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts).\nApplicant stated she paid two debts and disputed one. She did not provide any corroborating\ninformation to support her position. She has many delinquent debts that remain unpaid. I find FC MC\nE2.A6.1.3.1 and E2.A6.1.3.2 do not apply. Applicant chose to move with another family to a new\nlocation and was anticipating sharing expenses. When the other family moved she was required to\npay the total amount of the expenses. These conditions were beyond her control. However, many of\nApplicant\u2019s debts are for credit cards, retail establishments, and telephone services. Presumably these\ntypes of bills were not intended to be shared. Applicant did not elaborate on exactly what the financial\narrangements were that she had with the other family. I find FC MC E2.A6.1.3.3 applies because the\ninitial condition that placed her in a difficult financial position was beyond her control. The move\ntook place in 2002. It now has been more than four years and she has not taken action on resolving\nher delinquent debts. Applicant has stated in two separate documents that she intends on filing for\nbankruptcy. She showed proof that she had paid a partial payment to an attorney to assist her. She\nbelieved she would be discharged from all of her debts in September 2006. Applicant had the\nopportunity to provide additional information to show the status of her bankruptcy, but failed to do\nso. No evidence was presented to show any of her debts have been discharged in bankruptcy.\nBankruptcy is a legal way for people to start over financially. However, it does not negate the conduct\nthat may have caused the problems. Applicant opened new accounts in 2005 and failed to make timely\n\n6\npayments. She has not offered evidence to show her conduct is changed. Applicant stated she was\ngoing to begin taking care of her bills. Nothing has been offered to show how she is managing her\nbills. Applicant sought assistance from a credit consolidation company after she was interviewed for\nher clearance. She could not afford the payments and has taken no further action. No other evidence\nwas presented to show she has received any financial counseling nor is there a clear indication the\nproblem is being resolved. There has been no good-faith showing that Applicant is paying or\nresolving her delinquent debts. I find FC MC E2.A6. 1.3.4 and E2.A6.1.3.5 do not apply. \nThe Whole Person Analysis\nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The\nobjective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a person\u2019s\nlife to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance. Indeed,\nthe adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in considering the \u201cwhole\nperson\u201d concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of their acts, omissions,\nmotivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful\nanalysis.\nI considered all the evidence provided and also considered the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept in\nevaluating Applicant\u2019s risk and vulnerability in protecting our national interests. I considered\nApplicant was in a difficult financial situation when her friend left her with all the expenses. I also\nmany of her debts are years old and some are for relatively small amounts, yet she has not paid any\nof them. I considered her statements that she intended on filing for bankruptcy. I find Applicant has\nfailed to mitigate the financial considerations security concerns. Therefore, I am persuaded by the\ntotality of the evidence in this case, that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nApplicant a security clearance. Accordingly, Guideline F is decided against Applicant.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1\nFinancial Considerations (Guideline F)\nAGAINST  APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a-1.q:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. Clearance is denied.\nCarol. G. Ricciardello\n\n7\nAdministrative Judge\n",

She\nhas taken no steps to address her delinquent debt reportedly totaling $37,628 as of February 2007.\nJudgment and trustworthiness concerns are also raised by her criminal assault with a gun in\nSeptember 1999, and her failure to report known delinquencies on her application for a public trust\nposition. It is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant her a position of public trust.\n\nBy memorandum from the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence and Security) dated\n1\nNovember 19, 2004, DOHA was authorized to utilize the procedures of DoD Directive 5220.6 to resolve contractor cases\nforwarded to it by the Defense Security Service (DSS) or the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) for trustworthiness\ndetermination, including those involving ADP-I, ADP-II, and ADP-III positions. Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness is\nadjudicated under the revised adjudicative guidelines set forth in Appendix 8 of Department of Defense Regulation\n5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program, dated January 1987, as amended and modified (\u201cRegulation\u201d).\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn August 16, 2004, Applicant submitted an application for a position of public trust.  The\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant the application under\nDepartment of Defense Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program, dated January 1987, as\namended and modified (\u201cRegulation\u201d), and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive),\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program, dated January 1992, as amended\nand modified (\u201cDirective\u201d).  In a Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated August 22, 2006, DOHA\n1\nproposed to deny or revoke access to a sensitive position for Applicant because of conduct alleged\nunder Guideline F (Financial Considerations), Guideline J (Criminal Conduct), and Guideline E\n(Personal Conduct) of the adjudicative guidelines. Applicant answered the SOR on September 21,\n2006, and elected to have a decision on the written record without a hearing. Her answer was\nconsidered incomplete, in part because she did not indicate whether she wanted a hearing. On\nOctober 12, 2006, Applicant resubmitted her original answer, adding to her original response to\nquestion \u00b6 3.a and requesting a decision based on the written record without a hearing. \nThe government submitted a File of Relevant Material (FORM) on February 22, 2007,\nconsisting of 10 exhibits (Items 1-10). On February 23, 2007,  DOHA forwarded a copy of the\nFORM to Applicant and instructed her to respond within 30 days of receipt. Applicant submitted no\nrebuttal by the April 4, 2007, due date. The case was assigned to me on May 2, 2007, to consider\nwhether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a position of trust.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nDOHA alleged Applicant owes $38,122 in delinquent debt (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.l); was\nsentenced to ten years (suspended), and five years probation for a September 1999 assault and battery\nof a high and aggravated nature (\u00b6 2.a); falsified her August 2004 Questionnaire for Public Trust\nPositions (SF 85P) by not disclosing her delinquent debt in response to question 22(b) concerning\nwhether she was over 180 days delinquent on any debts (\u00b6 3.a), and committed thereby a felony\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 (\u00b6 2.b). In her Answer of October 12, 2006, Applicant admitted the\nindebtedness, which she could not pay as she was struggling to support two children as a single\nparent. She denied any intentional falsification of her SF 85P and explained she thought the inquiry\npertained to new debts. Applicant added that when the September 1999 \u201cincident\u201d happened, she\nreported it.\n            Applicant\u2019s admissions to delinquent debt and to the September 1999 assault are incorporated\nas findings of fact. After a thorough review of the documents before me for consideration, I make\nthe following additional findings:\n\nIn the jurisdiction where it occurred, assault and battery with intent to kill is a felony punishable up to 20 years\n2\nin prison. S.C. Code Ann. \u00a7 16-3-620. Assault and battery of a high and aggravated nature, a lesser included offense of\nassault and battery with intent to kill, is a common law misdemeanor punishable by up to ten years in prison.  It has been\ndefined as the unlawful act of violent injury to another accompanied by circumstances of aggravation such as the use of\na deadly weapon. Malice is an element of assault with intent to kill but not of assault and battery of a high and aggravated\nnature, although malice can be present. See e.g., State v. Fennell, 531 S.E.2d 512 (2000). \nApplicant\u2019s first child, who was born before the marriage, bears her spouse\u2019s last name.\n3\n4\nApplicant is a 30-year-old single mother of two children, ages 6 and 10. She has been\nemployed by a TRICARE benefits administrator since August 1998. On graduating from high school\nin 1994, Applicant went to work as a packer for a retail confectioner where she stayed until her\npresent employment.\nIn mid-September 1999, Applicant was out with her fianc\u00e9 visiting a mutual friend when she\ngot into an altercation with another woman who had been involved with her fianc\u00e9. Fearful because\nthe other woman was with four men, Applicant reached for a gun that was in the glove compartment\nof her vehicle. A scuffle ensued between Applicant and the other woman, during which the woman\nwas shot in the chin. Although Applicant maintained the gun went off accidentally, she was arrested\nfor assault and battery with intent to kill, a felony. In court in March 2000, she was convicted of\nassault and battery of a high and aggravated nature, and sentenced to ten years in prison, suspended,\nplaced on five years probation, and fined $100.  Applicant was required to report to her probation\n2\nofficer once every three months. In April 2000, Applicant and her fianc\u00e9 married,  and in December\n3\n2000, they had a son.\nOn September 3, 2003, Applicant was interviewed by an Office of Personnel Management\n(OPM) investigator about her criminal assault. Applicant indicated that the gun went off accidentally\nduring a scuffle, but she was arrested for assault and battery with intent to kill. She indicated she was\ncurrently serving five years of unsupervised \u201cparole,\u201d with which she was in compliance.\nOn August 16, 2004, Applicant executed an application for a public trust position (SF 85P).\nShe listed her conviction and five-year probation for the September 1999 assault in response to\nquestion 20 [\u201cIn the last 7 years, have you been arrested for, charged with, or convicted of any\noffense(s)? (Leave out traffic fines of less than $150).\u201d]. She checked off \u201cNo\u201d to inquiries\nconcerning her financial record, including question 22.b [\u201cAre you now over 180 days delinquent\non any loan or financial obligation? Include loans or obligations funded or guaranteed by the Federal\nGovernment.\u201d].\nA check of Applicant\u2019s credit on August 20, 2004, revealed several bad debts: a $351\ncharged off balance on a clothing store charge account due since November 1999 (\u00b6 1.a); a voluntary\nrepossession of a vehicle in 2000 with a $13,000 debt balance (\u00b6 1.b); a $183 jewelry store debt\nplaced for collection in March 1999 (not alleged); a MasterCard balance of $477 in collection since\nDecember 2002 (\u00b6 1.h); a personal loan debt of $230 in collection since February 2002 (\u00b6 1.d); a\npersonal loan debt of $158 in collection since November 2002 (\u00b6 1.g); a personal loan debt of $82\nplaced for collection in December 2000 (\u00b6 1.c); a medical debt of $32 in collection since December\n2000 (not alleged), and a furniture store debt of $165 rated 120 days or more past due (\u00b61.i). A\npersonal loan account with a high credit of $490 was rated as 120 days or greater past due, but with\na zero balance as of December 2001 (not alleged). Applicant had paid other loans according to terms,\n\nApplicant indicated grocery costs of only $100 per month, which does not seem like much for herself, two\n4\nchildren, and possibly her spouse.\nIn September 2006, Applicant indicated she was a single parent. It is not clear whether her spouse just not\n5\ncontributing to the household income as of March 2005 or he and Applicant had already separated. Applicant reported\nno income from child support.\n5\nincluding a secured  loan of $2,435.  Her loan of $34,231 opened in May 1999 for a manufactured\nhome, was being repaid timely at $365 per month (\u00b61.k) as of July 2004. She was also making her\n$312 monthly payments on a $14,996 car loan that she had recently taken out in June 2004.\nOn March 9, 2005, Applicant was again interviewed by an OPM special investigator, this\ntime about her finances. Applicant\u2019s attention was directed to the adverse credit information on her\nrecord. She did not dispute owing the furniture debt (\u00b6 1.i), the clothing store debt (\u00b6 1.a), the $183\njewelry store debt (not alleged), the MasterCard debt (\u00b6 1.h), the $230 personal loan debt (\u00b6 1.d), the\n$82 personal loan debt (\u00b6 1.c), or the $32 medical debt in collection (not alleged).  She contested the\nclaimed $13,000 deficiency balance on her auto loan (\u00b6 1.k) following the voluntary repossession\nof her vehicle, because she had been told that she owed $4,000 following the resale of the car.\nApplicant also disputed owing $490 on a personal loan that had been reported as 120 days or more\ndelinquent but with a zero balance (not alleged), as the debt had been paid in full in 2001. Applicant\nprovided a wage earning statement showing net pay of $630.55 for 80 hours. After payment of\nmonthly expenses, including $515.05 for her home, $312 on her car loan, and $50 toward a $430\nmedical bill, she estimated a net monthly remainder of $32.05.  She reported no income from her\n4\nspouse.  Applicant acknowledged that finances were tight from month to month. She admitted she\n5\nhad informed the companies attempting to collect on the debts that she cannot afford to pay them.\nApplicant expressed her intent to seek professional assistance to consolidate her debt. Applicant\nindicated she had not disclosed her debts \u201con case papers\u201d because she misunderstood the question.\nSince her credit problems were a private matter, they were not common knowledge among her\nfriends and colleagues, but she denied any susceptibility to blackmail, coercion, or pressure.\nMore recent checks of Applicant\u2019s credit on May 12, 2006, and February 22, 2007, revealed\nlittle progress toward resolving her delinquent debt and some new debt that had not been reported\npreviously.  A cellular telephone debt of $243 had been placed for collection in December 2004 (\u00b6\n1.j). Another phone service provider had placed a $190 unpaid balance for collection in November\n2005 (\u00b6 1.l). Two medical debts of $92 and $96 had been placed for collection in August and\nSeptember 2004, respectively (not alleged). Applicant\u2019s MasterCard debt of $477 had an updated\ncollection balance of $720 as of May 2006 and $793 as of February 2007 (\u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.h likely same\ndebt). The secured loan for her home had been placed for collection in April 2005 with a $22,443\nbalance (\u00b6 1.k). A personal loan taken out in April 2002 had been charged off in the amount of $159\n(\u00b6 1.e). An electric utility provider placed a $142 debt balance for collection in October 2006 (not\nalleged). The auto lender continued to report a deficiency balance of $13,000 following the\nrepossession of her vehicle (\u00b6 1.b). Although the furniture retailer reported a zero balance as of\nDecember 2006 (\u00b6 1.i), it was because of a charge off.  There was no report of any payment on that\naccount since March 2003.  The clothing store debt (\u00b6 1.a) had been dropped from her credit report\nby February 2007, but there was no evidence of payment.\n\n6\nApplicant continued to make her payments on the vehicle loan taken out in June 2004. By\nJanuary 2007, she had reduced the $14,996 loan balance to $6,146. In December 2006, Applicant\nincurred a new consumer credit debt of $493, to be repaid in $28 installments.\nPOLICIES\nThe President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national security\nand to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position that will give\nthat person access to such information. Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 527 (1988).\nTo be eligible for assignment to sensitive duties, an applicant must meet the security guidelines set\nforth in the Regulation. \u201cThe standard that must be met for . . . assignment to sensitive duties is that,\nbased on all available information, the person's loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that\n. . . assigning the person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national\nsecurity.\u201d Regulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1.\nDoD contractor personnel are afforded the right to the procedures contained in DoD Directive\n5220.6 before any final unfavorable access determination may be made. Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.\nAppendix 8 of the Regulation sets forth the adjudicative guidelines, as well as the specific factors\ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions for determining eligibility for access to classified information\nand assignment to sensitive duties. In evaluating the trustworthiness of an applicant, the\nadministrative judge must apply the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d and consider and carefully weigh the\navailable, reliable information about the person in light of the adjudicative process factors: the\nnature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; the frequency and recency of the conduct; the individual\u2019s age and\nmaturity at the time of the conduct; the voluntariness of participation; the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; the motivation for the conduct; the potential\nfor pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nRegulation AP8.\nCONCLUSIONS\nGuideline F\u2014Financial Considerations\nAn individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts\nto generate funds. (Regulation AP8, Guideline F). Despite consistent employment since she\ngraduated from high school, Applicant has struggled financially. As reflected in her credit reports,\nApplicant owed about $14,622 in delinquent debt (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, 1.e, 1.g, 1.h, and 1.i) by 2003.\nShe took out a car loan of $14,996 in June 2004, and while she managed to make her $312 monthly\npayments, she continued to fall behind in her obligations. Over the August/September 2004 time\nframe, $188 in medical debt was referred for collection. In December 2004, a $243 cellular phone\ndebt was sent for collection. By the first quarter of 2005, she had defaulted on her secured loan for\nmanufactured housing and a $22,443 balance was placed for collection. Her record of financial\nproblems raises concerns under disqualifying condition (DC) (1),  A history of not meeting financial\nobligations and DC (3), Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.\n\n7\nApplicant\u2019s financial difficulties are due in part to personal decisions that were within her\ncontrol, such as her purchase of a vehicle in June 2004. Yet, as of February 2005, Applicant was\nbeing paid an hourly wage of $10.50 from her job with the TRICARE claims processor. Assuming\na regular 40 hour work week, her annual income before deductions was less than $22,000. She had\na positive monthly remainder as of March 2005, but $32.05 is an insignificant amount for a single\nparent with two minor children.  There is no evidence that she could count on financial support from\nher spouse, whether or not they were still together. By September 2006 if not before, she was\nsupporting her two children on her own. Mitigating condition (MC) (3), The conditions that resulted\nin the behavior were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), applies in that her\nability to address her debts was compromised by lack of income.\n \nOngoing financial pressures may present an unacceptable risk, even if debts are incurred or\nleft unsatisfied due to factors outside of one\u2019s control. As of March 2005, Applicant described her\nfinancial status as stable, although finances were tight. She averred she was meeting all of her credit\nobligations but for the acknowledged delinquencies (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.d, 1.e, 1.h, and 1.i). However, the\nevidence shows otherwise. Only one month later, her loan for manufactured housing was charged\noff in the amount of $22,443. As recently as October 2006, a utility services debt of $142 was\nreferred for collection. Even if the deficiency balance for the repossessed vehicle is about $4,000\nrather than the $13,000 listed on her credit report, she still owes delinquent debt in excess of\n$28,000. There is little guarantee that she will be able to get out of financial difficulty in the near\nfuture. Applicant has not yet displayed the good personal financial judgment that must be demanded\nof those persons in a position of public trust. In December 2006, she took on new debt of $493,\napparently for furnishings.\nGuideline J\u2014Criminal Conduct and Guideline E\u2014Personal Conduct\nA history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability\nand trustworthiness. (Regulation AP 8, Guideline J). The government's case under Guideline J is\nestablished by her assault conviction for shooting another woman during a scuffle in September\n1999. There is no evidence she intended to kill her victim, but she showed extremely poor judgment\nin grabbing a gun when she had not been threatened with deadly force. DC (1),  Allegations or\nadmission of criminal conduct, and DC (2), A single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses, are\nclearly pertinent to an evaluation of Applicant's trustworthiness.\nSeven years have passed since the incident without a recurrence, and there is no indication\nthat Applicant ever violated her probation. However, her subsequent criminal false statement on her\napplication for public trust position precludes the favorable consideration of MC (1), The criminal\nbehavior was not recent, MC (2), The crime was an isolated incident, and/or MC (6), There is clear\nevidence of successful rehabilitation. Applicant responded negatively on her August 16, 2004, SF\n85P to question 22.b [\u201cAre you now over 180 days delinquent on any loan or financial obligation?\nInclude loans or obligations funded or guaranteed by the Federal Government.\u201d]. Just four days later,\na check of her credit revealed several unresolved delinquencies (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, and 1.h) that\nshould have been listed in response to question 22b. Applicant has consistently claimed that she\n\u201cmisunderstood the question.\u201d She did not elaborate as to the nature of her misunderstanding when\nshe was interviewed about her debts in March 2005. In September 2006, she indicated she thought\nit pertained to \u201cnew  debts.\u201d While Applicant was making her payments on her recently opened car\n\n18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 provides in part:\n6\n(a) Except as otherwise provided in this section, whoever, in any matter within the jurisdiction of the\nexecutive, legislative, or judicial branch of the Government of the United States, knowing and\nwillfully: (1) falsifies, conceals, or covers up by any trick, scheme, or device a material fact: (2) makes\nany materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation; or (3) makes or uses any false\nwriting or document knowing the same to contain any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent\nstatement or entry; shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 5 years, or both.\n8\nand manufactured housing loans, she knew that some of her long past due accounts were in\ncollection. She admitted in March 2005 that collection agencies had been in contact with her and she\ntold them that she could not pay the debts. Furthermore, she disputed the $13,000 deficiency balance\nfor the repossessed car on the basis that the car had been sold after the repossession and she had been\ntold she owed $4,000. Her denial of any intentional omission is not credible under the circumstances.\nBy omitting known delinquencies from her SF 85P, she violated 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001.  DC (2) must be\n6\nconsidered irrespective of the fact that she has not been criminally charged for violating that federal\nlaw.\nA knowing false statement to the government raises personal conduct concerns as well.\nConduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate that the person may\nnot properly safeguard classified information. (Regulation AP8, Guideline E).  Personal conduct DC\n(2), The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any\npersonnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct\ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security\nclearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities, applies.\nThe judgment concerns raised by a lack of candor can be overcome by a timely, voluntary\nrectification (see MC (3), The individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the falsification\nbefore being confronted with the facts). There is no evidence of any attempt at rectification by\nApplicant before her interview of March 2005. Even if I were to conclude that her disclosures to the\nOPM investigator were sufficiently prompt, MC (3) is not satisfied when admissions are after\nconfrontation. The only information of her interview comes from her affidavit where she indicated,\n\u201cInput from a published credit bureau report was brought to my attention\u201d (Item 7), which suggests\nsome element of confrontation was involved. Reform of the personal conduct and criminal conduct\nconcerns is not sufficiently established where Applicant remains unwilling to acknowledge the\nwillful concealment of her indebtedness when she completed her application for a public trust\nposition.\n\nThis debt is an updated collection balance of the account in \u00b6 1.h and does not represent an additional debt.\n7\nAn adverse finding is returned because she has not made any efforts to address it.\n9\nWhole Person Analysis\nThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance, or as applied to a\ntrustworthiness case, a position of trust  (AP8).  Applicant\u2019s history of financial problems, her\ncriminal assault, and her deliberate false statement on her application for a trust position, raise very\nsignificant concerns about her judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness (The nature, extent, and\nseriousness of the conduct, The frequency and recency of the conduct).  Applicant\u2019s earnings have\nbeen barely enough to support herself and her two children. Yet, even these difficult life\ncircumstances cannot justify a failure to be up-front about her financial situation. Reform is not\ndemonstrated where she has allowed a recent electric services debt to go to collection and has yet\nto take responsibility for her decision to conceal her debts from the government (The presence or\nabsence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes).\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.

The SOR detailed reasons \nwhy DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a eligibility \nfor a public trust position for him, and recommended referral to an administrative \njudge to determine whether such eligibility should be granted, continued, denied, or \nrevoked. \n \nIn an answer dated January 8, 2007, Applicant responded to the SOR \nallegations, and elected to have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a \nhearing.4 A copy of the file of relevant material (FORM), dated July 11, 2007, was \nprovided to him on July 27, 2007, and he was afforded an opportunity to file \nobjections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation.5 Submissions \nwere due by August 26, 2007.6 Applicant did not provide any submissions. The case \nwas assigned to me on September 26, 2007. \n \n \nFINDINGS OF FACT  \n \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.n. \nHis admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and \nthorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact.   \n \n                                                          \n1Item 5 (Standard Form (SF) 85P, Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions, dated August \n19, 2004). There is no allegation of falsification of this SF 85P. \n \n2Item 1 (Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated November 27, 2006). \n \n3On August 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a \nmemorandum directing application of revised Adjudicative Guideline to all adjudications and other \ndeterminations made under the Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, \nPersonnel Security Program (Regulation), dated January 1987, as amended, in which the SOR was \nissued on or after September 1, 2006.  The revised Adjudicative Guidelines apply to this case. \n \n4Item 4 (Applicant\u2019s response to SOR, dated January 8, 2007).  \n \n5Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) transmittal letter is dated July 12, 2007, \nand Applicant\u2019s receipt is dated July 27, 2007.  \n \n6Id. The DOHA transmittal letter informed Applicant that he had 30 days after Applicant\u2019s \nreceipt to submit information.  \n\n \n                                                                                                                                          \n \n3\nApplicant is 47 years old.7 He married in September 1987. He has two \nchildren, who were born in 1990 and 1995. He was on active duty in the Air Force \nfrom 1981 to 1984. He received his high school diploma in 1978. From April 1999 \nuntil he completed his SF85, he was employed by the same company.   \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nThe SOR listed 14 delinquent debts, ranging from $60 to $9,606, and totaling \n$21,567. In his response to interrogatories, dated September 7, 2006, Applicant said \nhe could not make any payments on his delinquent debts.  Department Counsel asked \nfor any information that might assist in making a trustworthiness clearance \ndetermination, Applicant responded: \n \nI realize my credit is bad, but I will get it under control.  But I would \nnever do anything to hurt my company, my country, and the people I \nwork with. I would never do anything to make my company mistrust \nme. I am loyal to my company and to my country. This is my oath. I \nlove my job and I will not do anything to ever jeopardize my job. I \nwant to keep my job! I promise I am worthy of my company\u2019s trust, \nand my country\u2019s trust. I have a Honorable Discharge from the USAF. I \nfaithfully served my country then, and as for my job now, I will \nlikewise faithfully serve my company and my country.    \n  \nIn the FORM at page 4, Department Counsel stated: \n \nTo date, he has taken no action to resolve [his delinquent debts], even \n[though] more than eight months [have elapsed] after it was formally \nbrought to his attention as a security concern.  Moreover, Applicant\u2019s \ndebts remain unresolved and there is no evidence that he is making \nprogress \ntoward \nmitigating \nconcerns \nto \nsupport \na \nfavorable \ntrustworthiness determination.  \n \n \n \nAs indicated previously, Applicant did not respond to the FORM.  He did not \noffer any explanation for how his debts became delinquent, or explain why he had \nnot made any payments or describe other efforts to resolve his delinquent debts. \n \n  \nPOLICIES \n \nIn an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness determination, an \nadministrative judge must consider the \u201cAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining \nEligibility For Access to Classified Information\u201d (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the AGs are divided into Disqualifying \n                                                          \n7Item 5, supra n. 1, is the source for the facts in this paragraph, unless otherwise stated.   \n \n\n \n                                                                                                                                          \n \n4\nConditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC), which are used to determine an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified or sensitive information. \n \n \nThese AGs are not inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, an administrative judge should apply these AGs in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. AG \u00b6 2. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and \ncommon sense decision. Because the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a \nnumber of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d an administrative judge \nshould consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and \npresent, favorable and unfavorable. AG \u00b6 2(c). \n \n \nAn administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors \nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) \nthe frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at \nthe time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the \npresence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) \nthe motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, \nor duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \n \n \nSince the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, \nthe final decision in each case is arrived at by applying the standard that \u201c[a]ny \ndoubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified information \nwill be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d AG \u00b6 2(b). In reaching this decision, \nI have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nIn the decision-making process, the Government has the initial burden of \nestablishing controverted facts by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d8 demonstrating, in \naccordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information. Once the \nGovernment has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, the \nburden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and \n[applicant] has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable \nclearance decision.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating \n                                                          \n8 \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as \nadequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case \nNo. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cThis is something less \nthan the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from \nthe evidence does not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d \nConsolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966). \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore \nthan a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 \nF.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \n\n \n                                                                                                                                          \n \n5\ncondition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. \nBd. Sep. 22, 2005).9 \n \nA person seeking access to classified or sensitive information enters into a \nfiduciary relationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. \nThis relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty \nhours. It is because of this special relationship the government must be able to \nrepose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants \naccess to such information. Decisions under this Directive include, by necessity, \nconsideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail \nto protect or safeguard classified or sensitive information. Such decisions entail a \ncertain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, \nrisk of compromise of such information. \n  \nThe scope of an administrative judge\u2019s decision is limited. Nothing in this \nDecision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, \nloyalty, or patriotism.  Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.  \n \n \nCONCLUSIONS \n  \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly \nabove, I conclude the following with respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR: \n \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the Government\u2019s concern concerning financial problems. \n\u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to \nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal \nacts to generate funds.\u201d \n  \n  \nTwo \nFinancial \nConsiderations \nDisqualifying \nConditions \nraise \na \ntrustworthiness concern and may be disqualifying in this case: \u201cinability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and (c).   \n \n                                                          \n \n9\u201cThe Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and \nunfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions \nof the Directive, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d ISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006).  \n\n \n                                                                                                                                          \n \n6\n  \nApplicant admitted he had 14 delinquent debts, totaling $21,567, as of \nSeptember 2006. The amount of delinquent debt was substantial, and Applicant did \nnot contest the assertion in the FORM that he did not pay or otherwise resolve any \nof the delinquent debts.  \n \n  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)-(e) \nare potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), \nand \nthe \nindividual \nacted \nresponsibly \nunder \nthe \ncircumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or \nis under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts; and, \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nAfter careful consideration, I conclude none of these mitigating conditions \napply. He did not show unusual circumstances caused his financial problems. His \noverall conduct with his creditors casts some doubt on his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. He did not indicate he was unemployed or \nunderemployed. He did not prove his debts resulted from medical problems. He did \nnot disclose any information indicating his actions were in good faith. He did not \nprovide evidence of aggressive and responsible efforts to resolve his delinquent \ndebt. He has not provided evidence showing he maintained communications with his \nSOR creditors. There was no evidence of \u201cclear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control.\u201d He did not provide \u201cdocumented proof to substantiate \nthe basis of the dispute or [provide] evidence of actions to resolve the issue\u201d with \nrespect to his delinquent debts. In sum, he has failed to demonstrate sufficient effort \nto resolve financial concerns, or that his debts resulted from circumstances beyond \nhis control.      \n \n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis \n\n \n                                                                                                                                          \n \n7\n \nIn addition to the facts discussed in the enumerated disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions, I have considered the general adjudicative guideline related to \nthe whole person concept under AG \u00b6 2(a). There is no reason to believe his actions \nwith respect to his debts were not knowledgeable and voluntary. He is 47 years old, \nsufficiently mature to be fully responsible for his conduct. The most probable \nmotivation for his failure to pay his debts is insufficient income. Failure to pay debts \nis not prudent or responsible.    \n \nThe current process has made him aware of the necessity to ensure his finances \nare not delinquent. \u201cApplicant is now alert to the [trustworthiness] concerns presented \nby his circumstances and the responsibilities incumbent on him as a result.\u201d ISCR \nCase No. 04-07360 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 26, 2006). The absence of evidence of any \nprior violation of his employer\u2019s rules or requirements weighs in his favor.     \n \nAfter considering all the circumstances, however, his delinquent debts \nsignificantly increase the trustworthiness concerns. The minimal evidence he \npresented of rehabilitation is insufficient to resolve my doubts about his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, all the facts and \ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has  not \nmitigated the trustworthiness concerns pertaining to financial considerations. The \nevidence leaves me with doubts as to his eligibility and suitability for a public trust \nposition.   \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d10 \nand supporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the \nAdjudicative Process, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities under the AGs. \nApplicant has not mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons \nstated, I conclude he is not eligible for a public trust position. \n \n \n \nFORMAL FINDINGS \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the \nSOR, as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \n Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   \n AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1n.: \n Against Applicant \n \n \n                                                          \n10See ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd.

Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended\n1\nand modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended and modified.\n2\nApplicant has successfully mitigated the foreign influence security concern, as the record\nevidence demonstrates that her connections to China are rather minimal or pro forma or both when\ncompared to her significant family, professional, and financial connections to the U.S.  Clearance is\ngranted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security\nclearance for Applicant.  On June 30, 2006, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR)  detailing\n1\nthe basis for its decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) of the\nDirective.  Applicant answered the SOR in writing on July 26, 2007, and elected to have a hearing\nbefore an administrative judge.  \nDepartment Counsel indicated he was ready to proceed on November 30, 2006, and the case\nwas assigned to me on December 15, 2006.  DOHA issued a notice of hearing on January 11, 2007,\nscheduling the hearing for January 23, 2007.  Applicant appeared with counsel and the hearing took\nplace as scheduled. \nThe government offered one document that was marked as Government Exhibit (GE) 1, and\nwas admitted into the record without objection.  Applicant submitted two documents that were\nmarked as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A and B, and were admitted into the record without objection.\nDOHA received the transcript on February 7, 2007.\nPROCEDURAL RULING\nAt the hearing, Department Counsel asked me to take administrative notice of Exhibits (Ex.)\nI to IV, U.S. Department of State, Background Note: China, April 2006; U.S. Department of State,\nChina (includes Tibet, Hong Kong, and Macau), Country Reports on Human Rights Practices - 2005,\nMarch 8, 2006; U.S. House of Representatives, Report of the Select Committee On U.S. National\nSecurity And Military/Commercial Concerns With The People\u2019s Republic Of China, 1999; and\nInteragency OPSEC Support Staff (IOSS), Intelligence Threat Handbook (2004), respectively.\nAdministrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for administrative\nproceedings.  See ISCR Case No. 02-24875 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No.\n02-18668 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2004); McLeod v. Immigration and Naturalization  Service, 802\nF.2d 89, 93 n.4 (3d Cir. 1986)).  The most common basis for administrative notice at ISCR\nproceedings is to notice facts that are either well known or taken from government reports. See Stein,\nADMINISTRATIVE LAW, Section 25.01 (Bender & Co. 2006) (listing fifteen types of facts for\n\n3\nadministrative notice).  Applicant did not object to my consideration of Exs. I to IV for purposes of\nadministrative notice. Tr. 10-12. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nIn her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations except SOR \u00b6 1.d., with\nexplanations.  Her admissions are incorporated into my findings, and after a thorough review of the\nrecord, I make the following findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 43-year-old married woman.  She was born and raised in the People\u2019s Republic\nof China (PRC), and at age 17 left home to pursue higher education and never returned home, but did\nstay in the PRC.  She attended a university in the PRC and was awarded a bachelor of science degree\nwith a major in architectural design in September 1986.  \nIn May 1995, at age 31, Applicant came to the U.S. on a training visa and worked as a\nmanager for a software company.  Tr. 53.  Shortly after arriving in the U.S., she met her future\nhusband, who is also a native of the PRC, and married him in September 1999.  Applicant became\na naturalized U.S. citizen in November 2003.  Her husband also became a naturalized U.S. citizen.\nApplicant and her husband have two minor U.S. born children, a six-year-old daughter and a three-\nyear-old son.  \nFrom June 1998 to August 1999, she participated in an applied developer internship at a\nvocational school and was awarded a certificate.  After being awarded her certificate, she worked in\nthe high technology industry until she began her current position as a database analyst for a defense\ncontractor in October 2004.  She is a first time applicant for a security clearance.\nApplicant\u2019s parents are resident citizens of the PRC (SOR \u00b6 1.a.).  Her mother is 72 years old\nand her father is 77 years old.  Tr. 22, GE 1.  Both of her parents are hearing impaired which makes\nany communication by telephone difficult, if not impossible.  Her parents do not have access to e-\nmail.  Applicant does not exchange letters with her parents.  Tr. 23, 35.  Her father retired from the\npost office approximately 25 years ago and is in very poor health.  Tr. 39.  Her mother is a retired\nlibrarian and is also in poor health.  Tr. 41.  Neither of her parents were or are involved in political\nactivities in the PRC, nor are they agents in any capacity of the PRC government.  The last time she\nspoke to a parent was in February 2006 and was unable to have a meaningful conversation because\nof their hearing problems.  Tr. 43.\nApplicant has a 50-year-old sister and a a 47-year-old sister who are resident citizens of the\nPRC (SOR \u00b6 1.b.).  She has not seen her older sister in 20 years and has no idea what she does for a\nliving.  She last spoke to her by telephone approximately two years ago to discuss her parents\u2019 health\nsituation.  She described her relationship with her 47-year-old sister as the same as with her older\nsister, i.e. virtually no contact whatsoever.  Tr. 24-25.  Applicant also has a 37-year-old brother who\nis a resident citizen of the PRC (SOR \u00b6 1.c.).  She does not know this brother, does not know his\nprofession, nor does she know how to get in touch with him.  Tr. 26.  Applicant has a 45-year-old\n\n4\nbrother living in the U.S. employed as a biologist (SOR \u00b6 1.d.).  He holds a \u201cgreen card\u201d and has a\npending application for U.S. citizenship.  Applicant\u2019s contact with her brother living in the U.S. is\nlimited to an occasional visit over a holiday.  Tr. 48-51.  Applicant is not close with any of her\nsiblings.  Tr. 57-58.\nFrom April 14, 2002 to May 1, 2002, Applicant visited the PRC for the first and only time\nsince she arrived in the U.S.  While there she had a chance encounter with one of her former college\nclassmates.  This classmate organized a small group of former classmates for an impromptu luncheon\n(SOR \u00b6 1.e.).  The only place Applicant went in the PRC was Beijing where she visited the Great\nWall and took in some authentic Chinese food.  Applicant has no plans to travel to the PRC.\nApplicant did not see her parents or siblings during this visit to the PRC.\nApplicant has no assets of any type in the PRC nor does she own any real or personal property\nin the PRC.  Tr. 36.  By contrast, Applicant and her husband own two homes in the U.S., conduct all\nof their banking in the U.S., volunteer at their local church and school, and have retirement accounts\nin the U.S.  Their total net worth is $662,000.00.  Applicant regularly votes in the U.S. and exercises\nall rights of citizenship.  Tr. 60-74.\nApplicant stated she is a U.S. citizen first and that her loyalties are with the U.S.  She further\nadded that if she were contacted by a representative from the PRC, she would not provide any\ninformation and report such contact to proper authority.  Tr. 28.\nApplicant submitted two reference letters, both of whom were former co-workers.  The\ncollective sense of these letters is that Applicant is an individual of the highest character, who is\ntrustworthy with a very strong work ethic.  AE A and B.\nAs requested by Department Counsel, I took administrative notice or official notice of certain\nmatters about the PRC and the nature of its government as described in Exhibits I through IV, which\nare summarized under subheading \u201cPRC\u201d of this decision.  I have considered these matters in making\nmy clearance decision. \nPRC\nPRC has an authoritarian, Communist government. PRC has a poor human rights record,\nsuppresses political dissent, and practices arbitrary arrest and detention, forced confessions, torture,\nand other prisoner mistreatment.\nPRC is a nuclear power with a large Army.  PRC is geographically vast, and has a population\nof over one billion people.  It has significant resources, and an economy that in recent years has\nexpanded about 10% per year. PRC aggressively competes with the United States in many areas.\nPRC\u2019s competitive relationship with the United States exacerbates the risk posed by Applicant\u2019s PRC\nconnections.  \nPRC actively collects military, economic and proprietary, industrial information about the\nUnited States because of the following circumstances: (1) its position as a global superpower; (2) its\nmilitary, political, and economic investments in the Pacific Rim and Asia; (3) its leading role in\ndevelopment of advanced technology that PRC desires for economic growth; and (4) PRC considers\n\nISCR Case No. 96-0277 at 2 (App. Bd.

Jan. 27, 1995); Directive, E3.1.15.\n6\n5\nthe large number of Americans of Chinese ancestry as intelligence targets. PRC\u2019s active intelligence\ngathering programs focus on sensitive and protected U.S. technologies. \nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudication guidelines which must be considered in\nthe evaluation of security suitability.  An administrative judge need not view the adjudicative\nguidelines as inflexible ironclad rules of law.  Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human\nbehavior, these guidelines, when applied in conjunction with the factors set forth in the adjudicative\nprocess provision in Paragraph E2.2., Enclosure 2 of the Directive, are intended to assist the\nadministrative judge in reaching fair and impartial common sense decisions.\nIncluded in the guidelines are disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC)\napplicable to each specific guideline.  In addition, each security clearance decision must be based on\nthe relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the factors\nlisted in the Directive. Specifically, these are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct;\n(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the\npresence or absence of rehabilitation and other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;\n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation\nor recurrence.  Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against\nclearance is not outcome determinative, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a\ncase can be measured against this policy guidance.\nThe sole purpose of a security clearance determination is to decide if it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an applicant.   The government\n2\nhas the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of proof is something less than a\n3\npreponderance of the evidence.   Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to the\n4\napplicant to present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against\nher.   Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance\n5\ndecision.6\n\nEgan, 484 U.S. at 528.\n7\nId.\n8\nId.; Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.2.\n9\nExecutive Order No. 10865 \u00a7 7.\n10\n6\nAs noted by the Court in Egan, \u201cit should be obvious that no one has a right to a security\nclearance\u201d  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations\n7\nshould err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d   Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant\n8\nshould be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such\nsensitive information.   The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a\n9\ndetermination as to the loyalty of an applicant.   It is merely an indication that the applicant has not\n10\nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a\nclearance.\nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern.  The\nobjective of the security clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a person\u2019s\nlife to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.  Indeed,\nthe adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in considering the \u201cwhole\nperson\u201d concept.  It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of their acts, omissions,\nmotivations and other variables.  Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking and careful\nanalysis.\nCONCLUSIONS\nGuideline B - Foreign Influence\nUnder Guideline B for foreign influence, a security concern may exist when an individual\u2019s\nimmediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom he or she may be bound by\naffection, influence, or obligation, are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress.\nThese situations could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise\nof classified information.  Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial interests in other\ncountries are also relevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable\nto coercion, exploitation, or pressure.  Common sense suggests that the stronger the ties of affection\nor obligation, the more vulnerable a person is to being manipulated if the relative, cohabitant, or close\nassociate is brought under control or used as a hostage by a foreign intelligence or security service.\nHere, based on the record evidence as a whole, the government initially established its case\nunder Guideline B.  Applicant has family ties to the PRC through her parents and siblings.  In\naddition, her trip to the PRC in 2002 is further evidence of connections to the PRC.  Taken together,\nthese circumstances raise a security concern under Foreign Influence Disqualifying Condition (FI DC)\nE2.A2.1.2.1.  An immediate family member, or person to whom the individual has close ties of\naffection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in a foreign country.  The remaining DCs\ndo not apply based on the facts and circumstances here.\n\n7\nI have reviewed all the mitigating conditions under Guideline B, and conclude that Foreign\nInfluence Mitigating Condition (FI MC) E2.A2.1.3.1. A determination that the immediate family\nmember(s), (spouse, father, mother, sons, daughters, brothers, sisters), cohabitant, or associate(s)\nin question are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in\na way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the person(s) involved and the\nUnited States); and FI MC E2.A2.1.3.3. Contact and correspondence with foreign citizens are casual\nand infrequent.  \nThe evidence shows Applicant\u2019s immediate family members are not agents of the PRC\ngovernment or in positions that would raise a security concern for the Applicant.  To the contrary, her\nparents are elderly, retired, hearing impaired, and in poor health and clearly outside the scope of\nemployment or positions that would target them for intelligence gathering.  Applicant\u2019s relationship\nwith her remaining siblings has become so removed throughout the years that she does not know what\nany of them do for a living.  \nSince Applicant left the PRC 11 years ago, she has fully vested her life in her work and family\nin the U.S.  Her contact with her immediate family members can hardly be described as close.  She\nhas not seen either of her two sisters in the PRC in over 20 years, and last spoke to her older sister\nby telephone two years ago to discuss her parents\u2019 health situation.  She does not know her brother\nwho lives in the PRC or anything about him.  She last attempted to speak to her parents by telephone\nin February 2006 and had a strained conversation at best given their hearing problems.  Her\ncommunication with her biologist-brother living in the U.S. is limited to telephone calls on holidays.\nWhen Applicant visited the PRC in 2002, she did not see any of her immediate family\nmembers which further demonstrates the distance that evolved between Applicant and her family\nmembers residing in the PRC.  Her visit to the PRC was for recreation purposes and it was during her\nvisit she had a chance encounter with a former classmate who arranged an impromptu \u201creunion.\u201d\nThe Appeal Board requires the whole person analysis address \u201cevidence of an applicant\u2019s\npersonal loyalties; the nature and extent of an applicant\u2019s family\u2019s ties to the U.S. relative to his [or\nher] ties to a foreign country; his or her ties social ties within the U.S.; and many others raised by the\nfacts of a given case.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-00540 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 5, 2007).\nThe analysis does not necessarily end with the formal mitigating conditions, as other matters\nunder the whole-person concept may mitigate the security concern.  Although the record shows\nApplicant has family ties to resident citizens of the PRC, these family ties are hardly close.\nConcerning Applicant, her last contact with her sisters in the PRC was by telephone two years ago\nand has had no contact with her brother in the PRC.  Her contact with her aged parents was in\nFebruary 2006 via a strained telephone call due to their hearing impairment.  Her contact with her\nbrother in the U.S. is limited to telephone calls around holidays.  Her visit to the PRC in 2002 did not\ninclude a visit with any of her immediate family members and her contact with former classmates\noccurred only after she met a classmate by chance.  Her relationships with her immediate family\nmembers in the PRC are distant due to the length of time she has lived in the U.S. since 1995 and\ngeographic separation.  And her life, both personally and professionally, is firmly rooted in the U.S.\nApplicant\u2019s ties or connections to the U.S. are strong.  Since her arrival here, she can fairly be\ndescribed as a model immigrant.  After she completed her training, she has been gainfully employed\n\n8\nin computer-related positions and most recently as a database analyst.  Moreover, her professional\ncareer and financial interests are clearly in the U.S. and that situation is unlikely to change.  \nWhen Applicant became a U.S. citizen, she swore allegiance to the U.S.  Her spouse is also\na naturalized citizen, and her two children are U.S. citizens by birth.  Her ties to these family members\nare stronger than her ties to family members in the PRC. Her closest family members are her husband\nand children.  They are U.S. citizens and live with her.  Because her husband and children live in the\nU.S., they are not vulnerable to coercion or exploitation by a foreign power.  The realistic possibility\nof pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress with regard to her husband and children are low.  There\nis no evidence she has ever taken any action which could cause potential harm to the U.S.  She\ntestified credibly that she takes her loyalty to the U.S. very seriously.  She is well regarded by her\ndefense contractor employer and is considered loyal and trustworthy.\nThe record evidence demonstrates Applicant has all the indicators of a self-reliant, industrious,\nmature, responsible, and trustworthy individual.  At this point in Applicant\u2019s life, her connections to\nthe PRC are rather minimal or pro forma or both when compared to her significant family,\nprofessional, and financial connections to the U.S.  After weighing the record evidence as a whole,\nI conclude Applicant has successfully mitigated the foreign influence security concern raised by her\nfamily ties to the PRC.  Accordingly, Guideline B is decided for Applicant.\nTo conclude, Applicant has met her ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable\nclearance decision.  In reaching my decision, I have considered the whole person concept, the clearly\nconsistent standard, and the appropriate factors and guidelines in the Directive. \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nSOR \u00b6 1. - Guideline B:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs a. - e.:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant a security clearance for Applicant.

He\n\n2\nrelapsed in April 2006 while in counseling with a psychologist for diagnosed alcohol dependence\nand under probation for his 2005 offense. Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for Applicant. As required by Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 \u00b6 E3.1.2\n(Jan. 2, 1992), as amended, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on September 25, 2006,\ndetailing the basis for its decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline G (Alcohol\nConsumption) and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG)\nissued on December 29, 2005, and implemented by the Department of Defense effective September\n1, 2006. The revised guidelines were provided to Applicant when the SOR was issued. Applicant\nanswered the SOR on October 17, 2006, and elected to have a hearing before an administrative\njudge. The case was assigned to me on November 22, 2006. Applicant waived the 15-day notice\nrequirement, and on December 11, 2006, I scheduled a hearing for December 19, 2006.\nThe hearing was convened as scheduled on December 19, 2006, to consider whether it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nFour government exhibits (Ex. 1-4) were admitted. Testimony was taken from Applicant and three\nwitnesses (a senior director at the company where Applicant works, his father, and his spouse) on\nApplicant's behalf, as reflected in the hearing transcript (Tr.) received on January 4, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nDOHA alleged under Guideline G, Alcohol Consumption, that Applicant drank alcohol at\ntimes to excess from about the early 1990s to at least October 2005; was charged with drunk driving\nin November 1993, May 1996, March 2004, and May 2005 and convicted of the 2004 and 2005\ndriving under the influence offenses; and received counseling for his alcohol use in 2004 and 2005.\nThe drunk driving offenses were cross-alleged under Guideline J, Criminal Conduct. Applicant was\nalso alleged under Guideline J to have been charged, while in the United States Marine Corps, with\nassault and property damage in June 1991, with reckless driving in February 1993, with indecent\nexposure and being in a restricted area in March 1993, and with burglary and simple assault in\nDecember 1997 after his discharge from the Marine Corps.\nApplicant admitted struggling with alcohol in the past, the drunk driving incidents and\ncounseling, but averred he was no longer drinking and had the support in place to maintain\nabstinence. He indicated counseling was continuing on a weekly basis voluntarily with the clinician\nlisted in \u00b6 1.f. Applicant also admitted his criminal record alleged under Guideline J, although he had\nno independent recollection of the events that led to the charges in \u00b6\u00b6 2.f, 2.g, and 2.h, and explained\nthat he had contested the December 1997 charges before pleading to an amended charge of unlawful\ntrespass.

After a\nthorough review of the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following additional findings:\nApplicant is a 35-year-old deputy program manager who has been employed by a defense\ncontractor since April 1998. He started working for his employer while still a college undergraduate\nand stayed on after he received his bachelor of science degree in May 2001. Applicant works in\nlogistics support for a major Marine Corps electronic countermeasures program. He seeks a secret-\nlevel clearance, which will be necessary for his duties on the implementation of a new security\nclassification guide for the program.\nAt age 19, Applicant enlisted in the United States Marine Corps. During his four years of\nactive duty from September 1990 to 1994, Applicant started using alcohol \u201cmore than socially.\u201d2\nWhen Applicant was home on leave in 1991, he was involved in an accident after drinking. (Tr. 67)\nOn February 23, 1993, he was charged with reckless driving (disposition not of record). On\nNovember 6, 1993, Applicant was with a companion at a local nightclub off-base when they got\ninvolved in a verbal altercation with two other Marines in the parking lot. It escalated into a physical\naltercation between Applicant and one of the other Marines. On complaint of the victim, Applicant\nwas stopped shortly after his vehicle entered the main gate. Military police detected a strong odor\nof alcohol on Applicant\u2019s breath, and he failed field sobriety tests. Applicant and his passenger were\napprehended, and Applicant was charged with driving while intoxicated (DWI), DWI (refusal) as\nhe refused to submit to a chemical analysis of his breath, and assault. His companion was charged\nwith provoking speech and gestures. Applicant was convicted of the DWI and assault charges.\nApplicant was granted an honorable discharge in 1994.\nFollowing his discharge, Applicant moved back to his home state and started college. He\ntransferred to the state university in September 1995. On May 16, 1996, Applicant was arrested for\nmisdemeanor DWI. That July,  he was fined $100 on an amended charge of careless and negligent\noperation.\nAs of December 1997, Applicant was working as a bartender while attending college full-\ntime. After his shift on December 8, Applicant and a companion entered a fraternity house where\nthey had reason to believe a party was being held. They were confronted by residents and a fight\nensued. Applicant was arrested for felony burglary and misdemeanor simple assault. He contested\nthe charges in court but in February 1998 pleaded guilty to an amended charge of misdemeanor\n\n4\nunlawful trespass and to misdemeanor simple assault. Applicant was given consecutive sentences\nof one year incarceration with probation, all but ten days suspended.\nMidway through college, Applicant in April 1998 started working full-time for his present\nemployer as an expediter. He became a part-time student, continuing to take classes at night as well\nas during the day. After only a short time, he was promoted by the defense contractor to material\nplanner. A year into that position, Applicant was brought from manufacturing into the business\nenvironment as a program planning specialist. He was promoted from there to deputy program\nmanager. In 2002, he served as acting program manager on a Navy destroyer defense system and\nreceived a $2,000 award for his performance. Applicant then transitioned to deputy program manager\non an advanced gun system program until he became involved with the electronic countermeasures\nprogram.\nWhile he did not allow his alcohol consumption to negatively affect his work, in about 2003,\nApplicant informed the director of the countermeasures program that he had a problem. On or about\nFebruary 29, 2004, Applicant was arrested for driving under the influence. He was fined $350,\nordered to undergo counseling, and his license was suspended for 90 days. Applicant participated\nin 10 to 12 counseling with a licensed alcohol and drug counselor from June 2004 through July 2004.\nThe counselor diagnosed him as alcohol dependent. Applicant understood that he could not safely\ndrink as eventually he would consume to excess. Having satisfied the counseling required by the\ncourt, Applicant did not continue his sessions as he felt he could deal with his problem on his own.\nOver the next year, Applicant drank on four or five occasions, primarily at family events\nwhere he felt it would be safe to drink. Applicant considered himself to be in recovery, as he was\nattempting to rectify his drinking problem and was not drinking as he had been before his 2004\ndrunk driving offense.\nOn May 11, 2005, Applicant was arrested for DUI, second offense, a misdemeanor. On July\n6, 2005, he was sentenced to a term of incarceration of four to 12 months, all but ten days suspended,\nprobation,  to fines and costs of about $400, 20 hours of counseling, and 18 months loss of license\neffective immediately. Applicant served the ten days on work release performing essentially\ncommunity service.\nApplicant abstained from alcohol after his May 2005 arrest. Sometime between July 6, 2005,\nand July 19, 2005, Applicant attended one session of alcohol counseling. He did not return due to\nwork schedule conflicts and lack of rapport with the clinician.\nIn application for a secret-level security clearance, Applicant completed an electronic\nquestionnaire of investigative processing (e-QIP) on July 19, 2005. In response to section 23\nconcerning his police record, Applicant listed his felony arrest for burglary in December 1997,\namended to simple assault, and his 2004 and 2005 drunk driving offenses. With respect to his recent\nDUI, Applicant explained, \u201cHad been seeking counseling but had a relapse. Currently attending\ncounseling again by order of the court but also by my own chosing [sic]. Have not drank since May\n11, 2005, the date of the incident.\u201d Under section 25 pertaining to any alcohol treatment, Applicant\ndisclosed that he received counseling between May 2004 and September 2004 (estimated), and from\nJuly 2005 to present. Under a section for additional comments, he indicated:\n\n5\nMy use of alcohol has caused me some problems in the past with the 3 charges\nmentioned on this form. I have acknowledged my problem, have sought counseling,\nand continue to seek counseling for this problem. It is my desire and my intention to\ncompletely abstain from the use of any alcohol now or in the future. (Ex. 1)\nApplicant was caught driving while his license was suspended on July 31, 2005. He had sold\nhis condominium because of transportation difficulties while his license was suspended. Given a\ndeadline by the buyer to clean out his garage, Applicant drove over to the condominium with a\ntrailer. En route home to his new residence, Applicant was pulled over because he had a taillight out,\nand he was charged with operating with a suspended license.  Applicant denies that he drove on any\nother occasion with a suspended license, and there is no evidence of record to the contrary.\nIn about December 2005, Applicant began weekly counseling with a psychologist, who is\nalso a licensed alcohol and drug counselor. Applicant was referred to this therapist by a friend. She\ndiagnosed him as alcohol dependent. Despite his counseling sessions, which he found to be\nconstructive, Applicant had a relapse in about April 2006. After three weeks on temporary duty at\na training site, Applicant had a couple of gin drinks on the plane en route home. Within hours of his\narrival home, Applicant reported to a work crew assignment as part of his probation for the May\n2005 offense. Applicant was given a random breathalyser, which tested positive for alcohol. Because\nof the violation of his probation, Applicant elected to serve the four days remaining of his work crew\nrequirement in a correctional facility.\nApplicant last saw the psychologist in September 2006. He had been having transportation\nissues and expressed his intent to resume their sessions once he regained his driver\u2019s license, as he\nfound them constructive. Although he regained his operator\u2019s license in mid-November 2006, he had\nnot been back to see the psychologist as of mid-December 2006.\nIn September 2006, Applicant got married to a citizen of the United Kingdom. They became\nacquainted via the Internet in November 2005, and got engaged in January 2006. She joined\nApplicant in the U.S. in July 2006. From a military background herself, Applicant\u2019s spouse was due\nto go into the U.K. military as a weapons systems officer on a 18-year commission before she met\nApplicant. She intends to enlist in the U.S. Army National Guard and has been offered a position in\nan informational operations unit once her residency is established. She leads a healthy, active\nlifestyle and does not drink alcohol. She has made it clear to Applicant that any drinking by him will\nnot be tolerated (\u201cI have zero tolerance for any kind of damaging addiction that\u2014that becomes a\nproblem in our relationship.\u201d Tr. 82).\nIn November 2006, Applicant and his spouse began joint counseling sessions with a certified\ndrug and alcohol counselor to help her understand some of the issues that led him to drink in the\npast. Under significant stress at work, Applicant also began attending Alcoholics Anonymous (AA)\nonce weekly as he did not want the stress to impact his sobriety. His spouse had printed out a\nschedule of local AA meetings and it was a couple of weeks before he went. He attended about three\nmeetings as of his December 19 security clearance hearing. Applicant has found them to be\n\u201cinspirational.\u201d He had not considered attending AA in the past as he viewed an affiliation with AA\nas stigmatizing and felt ashamed of his drinking problem. (Tr. 39, 73) Applicant\u2019s goal is to attend\nfour AA meetings per week. He does not intend to drink alcohol in the future. His spouse attends Al-\nAnon meetings to help her understanding of his alcohol problem.\n\n6\nApplicant\u2019s father, who served 20 years in the U.S. Navy, retired in January 2006 as vice\npresident of the defense contractor firm employing Applicant. He held a secret-level clearance for\nmost of his career. He first noticed Applicant had a drinking problem after his son was discharged\nfrom the Marines. He has no hesitation in recommending Applicant for a clearance as Applicant\nrecognizes his alcohol problem and is making \u201ca very valiant effort\u201d to deal with it.\nThe senior director of the countermeasures department at work has not seen any evidence of\nalcohol negatively impacting Applicant\u2019s performance at work. Applicant has proven very dedicated\nto the Marine Corps program he is working on and has exhibited undeniable patriotism. Applicant\nis the employee to go to for logistics activities at the facility. This director does not believe Applicant\nis at risk of a relapse. He considers Applicant to have \u201cturned a major corner\u201d as far as his drinking\nissues.\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527.\nThe President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants eligibility for\naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb.\n20, 1960). An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App.\nBd. Dec. 19, 2002).\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth potentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and\nmitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline. In evaluating the security worthiness of an\napplicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6 6.3\nof the Directive. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant. See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. It is merely an indication\nthe applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have\nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nCONCLUSIONS\nGuideline G\u2014Alcohol Consumption\nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the\nfailure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and\ntrustworthiness (AG \u00b6 21). Applicant has allowed alcohol to negatively affect his judgment since he\nwas in the Marine Corps in the early 1990s. Although not alleged, he admitted he had been involved\nin an accident after drinking when he was home on leave in 1991 (Tr. 67). He was convicted of\ndrunk driving offenses committed in November 1993, late February/early March 2004, and May\n2005, and was fined for alcohol-related careless and negligent operation in 1996. Disqualifying\n\n7\ncondition (DC) \u00b6 22 (a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the\ninfluence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of concern,\nregardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent, is\nimplicated. While Applicant admits drinking \u201cmore than socially\u201d starting from his days in the\nMarines, the frequency and amount of Applicant\u2019s drinking is not detailed in the record. Reasonable\ninferences of excessive consumption falling within DC \u00b6 22(c) habitual or binge consumption of\nalcohol to the point of impaired judgment, are thus limited to those occasions where he operated his\nvehicle while legally intoxicated.\nConsideration of DC 22(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional (e.g.,\nphysician, clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence, is\nwarranted because Applicant was counseled for diagnosed alcohol dependence (see Tr. 57) from\nabout December 2005 to September 2006 by a psychologist licensed by the state to provide alcohol\nand drug counseling. However, the government failed to makes its case for application of \u00b6 22(f)\nrelapse after diagnosis of abuse or dependence and completion of an alcohol rehabilitation\nprogram. He relapsed on five to six occasions after he completed his court-ordered counseling for\nhis 2004 DUI, but the record does not support that he had completed an alcohol rehabilitation\nprogram as of his relapses. The record is silent as to the nature of his treatment in 2004, and\nApplicant was still in active therapy with the psychologist as of his April 2006 relapse. Yet, that\nlatest relapse raises DC 22(g) failure to follow any court order regarding alcohol education,\nevaluation, treatment, or abstinence. As confirmed by his father (Tr. 95-98), Applicant was still on\nprobation for his 2005 DUI when he drank on the plane. When Applicant showed up to perform his\nwork release assignment, he tested positive for alcohol when he had been required to abstain.\nApplicant considers himself to be in recovery from alcohol since his 2004 DUI offense as\nhe no longer drank in previous patterns, knew he had a problem, and was addressing it. (Tr. 53) Yet,\nhe also testified he felt the counselor he saw in 2004 \u201cwas checking a box, as was [he] at that time.\u201d\n(T. 55) Given his subsequent drinking at family events where he felt it would be safe to consume\nalcohol, his recovery was half-hearted at best. Although he managed to remain abstinent after his\nMay 2005 DUI, his failure to pursue court-ordered counseling (save the one session in July 2005)\nuntil December 2005 shows a lack of active commitment to his recovery during that time.\nApplicant now recognizes that he cannot safely drink. He also deserves credit for his weekly\ncounseling from December 2005 to September 2006 with the psychologist (see \u00b6 23(b) the individual\nacknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol abuse, provides evidence of actions taken\nto overcome this problem, and has established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or\nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser)). Yet, his relapse in April 2006 and his failure to return to his\nsessions after he regained his operator\u2019s license in November 2006 raise questions about his\nrecovery. Applicant testified the psychologist gave him a favorable prognosis, but when asked what\nthis meant, he responded,  \u201cshe understood that [he] was truly working on\u2014on recovery\u201d (Tr. 57).\nThe record contains no professional assessment of his progress.  During October 2006, when work\nwas particularly stressful, he was not involved in any counseling or AA to assist him in his recovery.\nJoint counseling with his spouse with a licensed alcohol and drug counselor and involvement with\nAA once weekly since mid-November 2006 are too recent to enable an affirmative finding at this\ntime that his alcohol abuse is safely in the past, although Applicant appears sincere in his\ncommitment.\n\n8\nGuideline J\u2014Criminal Conduct\n Criminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.\nBy its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules\nand regulations (AG \u00b6 30). Culpability was not proven with respect to the February 1993 reckless\ndriving charge (\u00b6 2.g), but Applicant committed criminal conduct when he assaulted a member of\na fraternity during a scuffle in December 1997 (\u00b6 2.e), when he operated a vehicle while intoxicated\n(\u00b6\u00b6 2.a, 2.b, 2.d), and when he drove carelessly and negligently in May 1996 (\u00b6 2.c). Security\nconcerns are raised under DC 31(a) a single crime or multiple lesser offenses, and DC 31(c)\nallegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged,\nformally prosecuted or convicted. Furthermore, although not alleged, Applicant operated a motor\nvehicle while his license was suspended in July 2005, and he violated his probation for his May 2005\nDUI by drinking in April 2006. DC \u00b6 31(e) violation of parole or probation or failure to complete\na court-mandated rehabilitation program, is also implicated.\nThe unlawful trespass and simple assault were confined to the college environment where\nApplicant was looking to party. Recurrence is unlikely given the stability of his present lifestyle, with\nhis career and marriage. Applicant\u2019s undisputed dedication to his work is evidence of rehabilitation\nunder MC \u00b6 32(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including not limited to the passage\nof time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher\neducation, good employment record, or constructive community involvement. Yet, reform of his\nalcohol-related criminal conduct depends largely on the success he has had in dealing with his\nalcohol problem. Less than a year has passed since his  relapse in April 2006. While the adjudicative\nguidelines pertinent to criminal conduct do not specify the time an applicant must be free of criminal\nbehavior, his drinking in violation of his probation raises recent concerns for his judgment and reliability.\nWhole Person Analysis\n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.\u201d AG \u00b6 2(a). The\nsecurity risks presented by Applicant\u2019s off-duty abuse of alcohol to as recently as April 2006 (\u00b6\n2(a)(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; \u00b6 2(a)(3) the frequency and recency of the\nconduct) must be evaluated in the context of the \u201cwhole person.\u201d Applicant\u2019s dedication to the\nMarines and the countermeasures project in particular are unquestioned. He has not allowed his\nalcohol problem to negatively affect his work. Yet, the government must be assured that those\nindividuals granted fiduciary responsibilities do not present a risk off-duty as well. The evidence of\nrehabilitation includes counseling beyond what has been ordered by the court, and he has made\npertinent behavioral changes, such as avoiding those situations conducive to drinking (\u00b6 2(a)(6) the\npresence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes). However, those\nchanges, late in coming, are not enough to overcome his consumption of alcohol in April 2006, when\nhe knew he had been diagnosed as alcohol dependent and advised to abstain, he would be violating\nhis probation for the DUI, and his suitability for classified access was being investigated by the\nDepartment of Defense.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\n\n9\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.

In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \n\n \n \n \n5\n                                                          \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations  \nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations, a security concern typically exists \ndue to significant unpaid debts. Failure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy \ndebts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.2 \nA person\u2019s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \nupon terms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an \napplicant with a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a position of risk \nthat is inconsistent with the holding of a security clearance. An applicant is not required \nto be debt free, but is required to manage his finances so as to meet his financial \nobligations. \n \n \nFinancial considerations become a security concern when a person has \nsignificant delinquent debts. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of \nhaving to engage in illegal or unethical acts to generate funds to meet financial \nobligations. Additionally, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly safeguarding and \nhandling classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of \nlife provides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.  \n \n \nThe record evidence supports a conclusion Applicant has a history of financial \nproblems. Applicant owed approximately $17,000 on nine debts, some of which were \nduplicate debts. Disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6 19(a) \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy \ndebts\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c) \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations,\u201d apply.  \n \n \nThe largest of the debts listed in the SOR was a $9,111 tax lien (SOR \u00b61.b), \nwhich has been paid and released. As retired military, Applicant and his spouse are \ncovered by TRICARE medical insurance.  Additionally, his wife is covered by Medicare. \nHis military medical insurance and Medicare coverage addresses the three medical \ndebts (SOR \u00b61.c, $54, 1.d, $36, and 1.e, $122). The telephone bill listed in SOR \u00b61.i \n($116) has been paid. Applicant provided no documentation but maintains telephone \n \n2 Revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \u00b6 18. \n\n \n \n \n6\nservice with the same provider. If a delinquent debt did exist his telephone service \nwould routinely be interrupted.  \n \nApplicant has accepted a repayment offer related to SOR \u00b61.h ($1,817). \nApplicant has written the creditor in SOR \u00b61.f ($2,218) to set up a repayment plan. The \ntwo debts listed in SOR \u00b61.a ($1,873) and SOR \u00b61.g ($1,884) are the same debt. \nApplicant has written the creditor and is going to the county courthouse to review the \njudgment.  \n \n \nMitigating condition AG\u00b6 20(b) \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial \nproblem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances,\u201d has limited applicability. \nApplicant was unemployed from June 2006 to October 2006. When he asked his credit \ncard providers for assistance, they increased the interest rate on his credit cards. He is \nnow addressing his debts and attempting to establish repayment plans with all of his \ncreditors. \n \n \nMitigating conditions AG \u00b6 20 (a) \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so \ninfrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does \nnot cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d \napplies. Applicant is addressing the debt and his delinquencies are not likely to recur. \n \n \n There is no evidence Applicant has sought financial counseling, but has  \ndemonstrated a positive change in his financial management. The problem is being \nresolved or under control. AG \u00b6 20 (c) \u201cthe person has received or is receiving \ncounseling for the problem and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control,\u201d applies as does AG \u00b6 20 (d) \u201cthe individual initiated a \ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d  \n \n \nFor AG \u00b6 20 (d) to apply there must be an \u201cability\u201d to repay the debts, the \u201cdesire\u201d \nto repay, and evidence of a good-faith effort to repay. A systematic, concrete method of \nhandling his debts is needed. Applicant has paid the largest of the debts, the tax lien, \nwhich was more than half the total delinquency. He has accepted a repayment offer on \nanother debt and is attempting to establish repayment plans on the remaining debts. He \nhas the desire to pay his bills.   \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n\n \n \n \n7\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \nAppellant has acted responsibly to resolve his debts and improve his current \nfinancial picture. He intends to resolve his financial problems and his resolve appears to \nbe genuine. He is 59-years-old and a mature, responsible adult who acting to ensure his \npast financial difficulties will not recur. Appellant is making monthly payments on one \ndebt, is attempting to establish repayment plan on the two remaining debts, which total \napproximately $4,000, and the reminder have been paid. Overall, the record evidence \nleaves me without questions or doubts as to Appellant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance.  \n \nThe facts and circumstances presented do not pose an unacceptable risk to the \ninterests of national security. For all these reasons, I conclude Appellant mitigated the \nsecurity concerns arising from his financial considerations concerns. Applicant met his \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. In reaching this \nconclusion, the whole-person concept was given due consideration and that analysis \nsupports a favorable decision.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a-1i: \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.  \n \n \n_________________ \nCLAUDE R. HEINY II \nAdministrative Judge \n \n",

However, Department Counsel did\nnot raise these objections on appeal.  Therefore, they are not before the Board.  \n2\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On June 29, 2007, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).\nAlthough Applicant requested a decision on the written record, he subsequently moved to convert\nhis case to a hearing.  Department Counsel did not object.  On April 28, 2008, after a proceeding\nconducted telephonically, Administrative Judge Mark W. Harvey denied Applicant\u2019s request for a\nsecurity clearance.  Applicant filed a timely appeal pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether he was denied due process as set\nforth in the Directive and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance decision is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Finding error, we remand the case to the Judge.\nThe SOR alleges that Applicant has numerous delinquent debts and that he deliberately\nprovided false answers on the security clearance form.  On appeal Applicant states that the\ntelephonic procedure which the Judge employed in this case denied him the benefit of a hearing as\ncontemplated by the Directive, specifically an opportunity for the Judge to evaluate his demeanor.\nApplicant requests an opportunity to present his case in person.  We construe this to be a request to\nremand the case to the Judge for a new proceeding.  \nWe have examined the record.  We note that Government Exhibit (GE) 4 contains a series\nof e-mail messages between the Judge and the parties concerning the proposed hearing.  Specifically,\nApplicant was not able to attend the hearing in person, due to his presence in a war zone.  There were\nlogistical difficulties setting up a video teleconference (VTC), which, in his appeal, he attributes to\ntechnical difficulties at DOHA.  By e-mail dated February 22, 2008, the Judge mentioned a\ntelephonic interview as an alternative to the VTC, advising Applicant that \u201cYou have a right to an\nin personam hearing . . . A speaker phone interview is not a hearing.  A hearing requires the judge\nto assess credibility through observing demeanor.   A speaker phone interview would be recorded\nand transcribed.  A speaker phone interview is a lawful manner for you to present information for\nmy consideration . . .\u201d  Subsequently, Applicant sent the following message to the Judge and to\nDepartment Counsel: \u201cIt looks like the VTC is not going to work out as well as we had planned.  I\nwill put this in writing so everyone will know that I am requesting this.  I, [Applicant], am requesting\na tele-conference for my interview with the personnel listed in this email.\u201d  \nAccordingly, the parties arranged for a telephonic interview of Applicant, which occurred\non March 20, 2008.   At the beginning of the proceeding, the Judge advised Applicant that he had\na right to a hearing in person or by video-teleconference and asked Applicant if he waived that right.\nApplicant replied that he did so waive.  Tr. at 14.1\n\n3\nAn applicant has a right under the Directive to present matters to a Judge in an effort to\nmitigate any security concerns in his case.  He can do so in writing, the Judge deciding the case on\nthe written record.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.7.  He can also do so by means of a hearing in which he appears\nin person.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.8.  There is no other alternative means for an Applicant to present his\ncase to DOHA.  In the case at issue here, Applicant initially requested a determination on the written\nrecord.  He later changed his mind and requested a hearing, to which the Department Counsel did\nnot object.  A review of the record suggests that, throughout the processing of his case, Applicant\ndesired the benefits of a hearing, agreeing to the telephonic interview only when a VTC could not\nbe accomplished.  By advising Applicant that the telephonic interview was not a hearing but, rather,\na means by which Applicant could make a statement, the Judge appears, in effect, to have converted\nthe case to an administrative determination on the written record, Applicant\u2019s telephonic interview\nserving as an alternative to a written response to the Government\u2019s File of Relevant Material.\nDespite Applicant\u2019s having stated that he waived his right to a VTC, it is not clear that Applicant\nunderstood the significance of the procedure utilized in his case.   The Board notes that on more than\none occasion during the telephonic interview the Judge referred to the procedure in question as a\n\u201chearing,\u201d that he provided the Department Counsel with an opportunity to present evidence,\nexamined Applicant\u2019s capacity to represent himself, and advised Applicant of the proper method by\nwhich he should lodge any objections to that evidence.    See, e.g., Tr. at 3 - 8.  The Judge advised\nApplicant of the extent to which the Federal Rules of Evidence would apply to the interview, a\nprocedure more pertinent to a hearing.  Tr. at 8.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.19.  He also advised Applicant\nthat \u201cthe hearing will be open\u201d unless Applicant requests otherwise, which is a rule with no\napplicability to a determination on the written record.  Tr. at 9; Directive \u00b6 E3.1.12.  The Judge\nappears to have conducted the interview more in the manner of a hearing than merely of transcribing\na statement for use in a determination on the written record.  Examining the record as a whole, it is\nreasonable to conclude that, despite the Judge\u2019s advice concerning the limitations of a telephonic\ninterview, Applicant may have believed himself to be receiving more of the benefits of a hearing\nthan was actually the case.  \nWhile applicants can waive various rights under the Directive, including the right to a\nhearing, waivers must be knowing and intelligent.  See ISCR Case No. 06-24460 (App. Bd. Apr. 30,\n2008)(waiver of right to counsel); ISCR Case 05-01237 (App. Bd. May 10, 2007)(waiver of right\nto 15 day notice of the hearing).  See also ISCR Case No. 03-08512 at 3 (App. Bd. Jun. 8, 2005) for\nlist of factors demonstrating a proper waiver of the right to a hearing.  Given Applicant\u2019s  pro se\nstatus, the likely exigencies of communicating to DOHA from a war zone, and the circumstances\nhighlighted above, a reasonable person could conclude that Applicant\u2019s waiver of his right to a\nhearing was not sufficiently knowing so as to satisfy the due process requirements of Directive.\nAccordingly, the Board concludes that the best course of action is to remand the case to the Judge\nfor a new proceeding, either a determination on the written record or a hearing that complies with\nthe requirements of the Directive (making appropriate allowances given Applicant\u2019s presence in a\nconflict zone).  The remaining issue is not ripe for consideration.\n\n4\n  \nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance decision is REMANDED. \nSigned: Michael Y. Ra\u2019anan       \nMichael Y.

Applicant appealed, and in a decision dated October 31, 2008, the Appeal Board\nremanded the case for a new proceeding that complies with the Directive. After a subsequent\nhearing, the Administrative Judge denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant\ntimely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raises the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  For the following reasons, the Board affirms the Judge\u2019s unfavorable\ndecision. \nApplicant essentially contends that the Judge\u2019s adverse decision should be reversed because\nthe Judge did not give adequate weight to mitigating evidence and other favorable evidence about\nthe origin of his delinquent debts, the basis for his false answer to question 21 of his security\nclearance application, and his military service.  In support of his request, Applicant summarizes the\nfavorable evidence he presented below.  Applicant\u2019s argument does not demonstrate that the Judge\u2019s\nultimate conclusions are in error.\nThe presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a\nfavorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a\nwhole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.\nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-10320 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 7, 2007).  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with\nthe Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the\nevidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in\na manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3\n(App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007).  \n   \nThe Board does not review a case de novo.  After reviewing the record, the Board concludes\nthat the Judge\u2019s ultimate unfavorable security clearance decision is sustainable.\nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Michael Y.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact8 In his SOR response, Applicant admitted responsibility for the federal and state tax debts listed in the SOR, and that he did not disclose his debts and two felonies on his 2004 SF 86. He said he did not intend to deceive the government. Applicant explained why he believed the security concerns were mitigated. His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 51 years old (Tr. 4).9 He served on active duty from 1978 to 1982 in the Navy. He has two years of college (Tr. 4). He has been employed by government contractors since 1998 (Tr. 17-18),10 and began working for the current government contractor on November 30, 2006 (Tr. 17). He has an interim, locally approved clearance (Tr. 5-6). He has been married four times, and his most recent marriage occurred in 2003 (Tr. 37-38). His two children were born in 1997 and 2005 (Tr. 38). Financial Considerations (Guideline F) Applicant\u2019s SOR lists seven debts. On January 31, 2008, Applicant sent an e- mail which includes the statement, \u201cI have been making payments to clear my debts, and as they are completed, I have asked them to send me documentation for the payment in full and that my matters with these debts are cleared.\u201d (GE 10).

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn May 6, 2004, Applicant submitted a Security Clearance Application (e-QIP \nversion) (hereinafter SF 86) (Government Exhibit (GE) 1-4). On June 29, 2007, the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \nto him,1 pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within \nIndustry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified. The SOR \nalleges security concerns under Guidelines F (Financial Considerations), and E \n \n1Government Exhibit (GE) 1-1 (Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated June 29, 2007). GE 1-1 is \nthe source for the facts in the remainder of this paragraph unless stated otherwise. \n \nApril 28, 2008\n\n \n2 \n                                                                                                                                                             \n                                                          \n(Personal Conduct).2 The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the \npreliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for him, and recommended \nreferral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, \ncontinued, denied, or revoked. \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR allegations, and elected to have his case \ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.3 A complete copy of the file of \nrelevant material (FORM), dated November 1, 2007, was provided to him, and he was \nafforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, \nor mitigation.4 On December 10, 2007, Applicant requested a 90-day delay to submit his \nresponse to the FORM (GE 5 at 3). Department Counsel concurred with a 30-day delay, \nbut objected to a 90-day delay (GE 5). On January 15, 2008, the case was assigned to \nme. For at least a year prior to his hearing, Applicant was assigned to a combat zone \noverseas, and collection of evidence was difficult for him (Tr. 22-23). After a series of e-\nmail communications, Applicant requested to provide a statement in the format of a \nteleconference. In an e-mail dated March 19, 2007 (GE 7), Applicant stated: \n \nI appreciate everyone's efforts [to attempt to arrange a video \nteleconference (VTC)). It looks like the VTC isn't going to work out as well \nas we had planned. I will put this in writing so everyone will know that I am \nrequesting this. I [Applicant\u2019s name], am requesting a tele-conference for \nmy interview with the personnel listed in this email. My VTC personnel \nhere will email you with the phone number to the room I will be using for \nthis tele-conference. I look forward to speaking with you.5 \n \n2On Aug. 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a memorandum \ndirecting application of revised Adjudicative Guideline to all adjudications and other determinations made \nunder the Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program \n(Regulation), dated Jan. 1987, as amended, in which the SOR was issued on or after Sep. 1, 2006. The \nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines are applicable to Applicant\u2019s case because his SOR was issued after \nSep. 1, 2006. \n \n3GE 1-2 (Applicant\u2019s undated response to SOR).   \n \n4The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) transmittal letter informed Applicant that \nhe had 30 days after Applicant\u2019s receipt to submit information. \n \n5 At the hearing the following exchange occurred: \n \nAdministrative Judge:  . . . I want to make it clear that [Applicant] has requested that we \ndo a speaker, non-video type hearing today.  Is that correct, [Applicant]? \n \nApplicant: That is correct, sir. \n \nAdministrative Judge: You understand that under the Directive, you have a right to an in-\nperson hearing or at least a video teleconference type hearing.  Is that correct? \n \nApplicant: Yes. \n \nAdministrative Judge: And knowing you have those rights, you\u2019ve decided to waive those \nrights and present your case in the format of a speaker hearing.  Is that correct? \n\n \n3 \n                                                                                                                                                             \n                                                                                                                                                                                          \n \nThe teleconference proceeding itself was conducted in manner consistent with a \ntypical DOHA security clearance hearing; however, it was not a hearing as I could not \nobserve Applicant\u2019s demeanor during the interview. This interview was conducted on \nMarch 20, 2008, and Department Counsel was present with me in the room with the \nspeaker phone. There were no objections to my consideration of GEs 1-6 (Transcript \n(Tr.) 11). The interview transcript was received on March 28, 2008. Applicant\u2019s final \nsubmissions were received on April 5 and 16, 2008 (GE 8 and 9).  He also made a brief \nstatement in an e-mail submission (GE 10). GEs 1 -10 are admitted.  \n \nProcedural Rulings \n \nDepartment Counsel objected to my communications with Applicant using e-mail \n(with a copy electronically provided to Department Counsel), arguing such a procedure \nis not permitted under the Directive and is unfair to the Government. Department \nCounsel recommended selection of one of three options: (1) use of video \nteleconference (VTC), (2) delay until in-person presentation or (3) close of the record \nwithout further presentation of evidence.  \n \nDepartment Counsel contended use of e-mail to collect evidence6 is too helpful \nto the Applicant because the process will reveal how disqualifying conditions might be \nmitigated,7 and unfairly facilitates gathering and presenting documentary evidence.  \nMoreover, it does not permit Applicant\u2019s cross-examination, or observation of an \nApplicant\u2019s demeanor.   \n \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s observations about the limitations of written evidence and \ne-mail in regard to cross-examination and assessment of demeanor are well taken. E-\n \n \nApplicant: That\u2019s correct. \n \nTr. 13-14.   \n \n6 An Administrative Judge has some discretion to research issues, especially to protect the rights \nof a pro se Applicant, so long as the product of the research if used to decide an issue is provided to the \nparties, and the parties have an opportunity to comment on the information. See Hines v. Department of \nHealth and Human Services, 21 Cl.Ct. 634 (1990); Illinois v. Swart, 860 N.E.2d 1142 (Ill. App. 2006), but \nsee Kershner v. Massanari, 16 Fed. Appx. 606 (9th Cir. 2001) (unpublished opinion) (stating the \nadministrative law judge (ALJ) \u201cshould not have gone outside the record to perform his own medical \nresearch,\u201d and noting the ALJ incorrectly applied a medical summary of an article to determine a pro se \nclaimant was not credible without providing the article to the parties). See, e.g., Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, 548 \nU.S. 547 (2006) (providing an example of an appellate decision with several citations to internet \ndocuments). \n \n7 \u201c[A]n ALJ has a heightened obligation to assist a pro se claimant, in particular to \"assist [him or \nher] affirmatively in developing the record.\" Carroll v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, 872 \nF.Supp. 1200, 1204 (E.D.N.Y. 1995) (citing Smith v. Bowen, 687 F.Supp. 902, 906 (S.D.N.Y. 1998)). \n\u201cEspecially where an unrepresented claimant's record is inconsistent and incomplete, an ALJ must \n\u2018scrupulously and conscientiously probe into, inquire of and explore all the relevant facts.\u2019\u201d Id. (Citing \nHankerson v. Harris, 636 F.2d 893, 895 (2d Cir. 1980)). See also Garrett v. Richardson, 363 F. Supp. 83 \n(E.D.S.C. 1973) (discussing ALJ\u2019s responsibility to obtain reports for full and fair hearing).   \n\n \n4 \n                                                                                                                                                             \n                                                          \nmail and speaker phone evidence presentations are not equivalent to in-person \ntestimony and do not constitute a \u201chearing.\u201d The cross-examination and full evaluation \nof demeanor and credibility through a hearing are critical due process components.  \nHowever, Applicant can waive his hearing as under the FORM process and in this case \naffirmatively chose to do so.   \n \nI overruled Department Counsel\u2019s motion to preclude consideration of e-mailed \ninformation. The Directive does not address methods of collecting evidence such as \nVTC, e-mail and speaker phones. Moreover, VTC is routinely used and encouraged to \nconduct security clearance hearings because travel expenses are saved. E-mail and \nspeaker phones should also be encouraged as a substitute for written correspondence \nas they allow an almost real time response and more timely clarification, speeding the \nprocessing of cases and improving the quality of the evidence received.     \n \nFindings of Fact8 \n \nIn his SOR response, Applicant admitted responsibility for the federal and state \ntax debts listed in the SOR, and that he did not disclose his debts and two felonies on \nhis 2004 SF 86. He said he did not intend to deceive the government. Applicant \nexplained why he believed the security concerns were mitigated. His admissions are \nincorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the \nevidence of record, I make the following findings of fact.  \n \nApplicant is 51 years old (Tr. 4).9 He served on active duty from 1978 to 1982 in \nthe Navy. He has two years of college (Tr. 4). He has been employed by government \ncontractors since 1998 (Tr. 17-18),10 and began working for the current government \ncontractor on November 30, 2006 (Tr. 17). He has an interim, locally approved \nclearance (Tr. 5-6). He has been married four times, and his most recent marriage \noccurred in 2003 (Tr. 37-38). His two children were born in 1997 and 2005 (Tr. 38). \n \nFinancial Considerations (Guideline F) \n \nApplicant\u2019s SOR lists seven debts. On January 31, 2008, Applicant sent an e-\nmail which includes the statement, \u201cI have been making payments to clear my debts, \nand as they are completed, I have asked them to send me documentation for the \npayment in full and that my matters with these debts are cleared.\u201d (GE 10).  Specific \ninformation about each debt follows: \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a. describes a federal tax lien filed on April 27, 1998, in the amount of \n$5,512.  Applicant filed his federal tax returns, and was unclear about why there was a \nfederal tax lien (Tr. 19-23). \n \n8 The facts in this decision do not specifically describe employment or locations in order to protect \nApplicant and his family\u2019s privacy. The cited sources contain more specific information.  \n \n9 Applicant\u2019s SF 86 (GE 1-4) is the source for the facts in this paragraph, unless stated otherwise. \n \n10 He indicated in an e-mail dated January 31, 2008, that he has been working hard for his \ncountry for 12 years (GE 10). \n\n \n5 \n                                                                                                                                                             \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b to 1.d list state tax liens filed on November 15, 1999, in the amounts \nof $911; $1,591; and $1,814.  Applicant remembered when he filed his Oregon state tax \nreturn in 1998 he owed less than $1,000 (Tr. 20).  He suspected that his former spouse \n(who also charged $20,000 in bills when she visited his overseas location in the late \n1990s) took the money that was supposed to be paid to Oregon (Tr. 21).  Around mid-\nJanuary 2008, Applicant\u2019s cousin contacted the state of Oregon to obtain information \nabout his state tax debt (Tr. 21-22). \n \nFor SOR debts \u00b6\u00b6 1.a to 1.d, Applicant said he was not notified of these debts \nand was unaware of them (GE 1-2). In his response to interrogatories, dated April 3, \n2007, he said for SOR debts \u00b6 1.a, he was overseas for the past nine years and was tax \nexempt (GE 1-5). On April 15, 2008, in an email he said the federal and state taxes \nowed are being resolved using direct withdrawal from his bi-weekly pay (GE 6). He \nprovided his pay statement showing a payment of $1,394 towards his federal tax debt \n(GE 6). His next five pay statements will result in full payment of his federal tax debt \n(GE 6). His state tax payments should appear on his next pay statement (GE 7). \n  \nSOR \u00b6 1.e describes Applicant\u2019s credit card account, which became delinquent in \n2002 in the amount of about $8,708. Applicant said he charged travel expenses \nincurred on behalf of his employer, and he believed his employer was responsible for \npaying the creditor (Tr. 24-26). In his response to the SOR and to interrogatories, he \nsaid his employer told Applicant that this debt was resolved in 2003 (GE 2, 5). In his \nresponse to interrogatories, dated April 3, 2007, he said he was \u201ctaking action to rectify \nthis situation and have it removed from [his] files\u201d (GE 5). In his SOR response he \npromised to investigate removal of this delinquent debt from his records (GE 1-2). On \nFebruary 19, 2008, I specifically asked Applicant by email to provide copies of \ndocumentation he used to investigate and dispute this debt (GE 6-V). On March 20, \n2008, he said he contacted the creditor and the creditor was attempting to obtain \nresolution from his former employer (Tr. 24). He told the creditor he would pay the debt, \nand the creditor offered to cut the debt by one third (Tr. 25). Applicant had no \ncorrespondence with the creditor\u2014all of his communications with the creditor were \nverbal, over the telephone (Tr. 25). On April 15, 2008, in an email he said the creditor \n\u201care/have sent me a settlement that would be reimbursed in the event [his former \nemployer] were to pay off this debt.\u201d (GE 6).  \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.g are two credit card accounts, which became delinquent in \n2003 in the amounts of $772 and $516. In Applicant\u2019s SOR response, he said his former \nspouse incurred these debts without his knowledge and he paid them in March 2007 \n(GE 1-2). At his hearing, he said his wife was responsible for one account, he was \nresponsible for the other, and both were taken care of (Tr. 28). On January 31, 2008, \nApplicant provided a letter from the creditor indicating that an account from the creditor \nfor $222 was settled and paid on March 26, 2007 (Tr. 28, GE 6-C). The account number \nin GE 6-C matches the account number in the credit report for the $516 debt, and I find \n\u201cFor Applicant\u201d on SOR \u00b6 1.g (Tr. 28-29, GE 1-10 at 2). On February 19, 2008, I asked \nApplicant by e-mail to provide documentation showing proof of payment for the other \n\n \n6 \n                                                                                                                                                             \ndebt (GE 6-V). On April 15, 2008, he said in an email, \u201cA settlement is being sent me \nwhich when paid will be considered paid in full.\u201d (GE 6). \n \nHis pay statement for April 3, 2008, shows bi-weekly pay of $5,104 (GE 6). He \nsaid he worked very diligently from December 2007 to March 20, 2008 (his hearing \ndate) to investigate and resolve his delinquent debts (Tr. 23-24).  He promised \u201c100 \npercent to take care of\u201d his debts (Tr. 24).   \n \n Personal Conduct (Guideline E) \n    \n \nApplicant answered, \u201cNo\u201d on his SF 86, executed on May 6, 2004, to three \nquestions that are relevant to the issue of whether Applicant falsified his SF 86: \n \nQuestion 21. Your Police Record \u2013 Felony Offenses Have you ever \nbeen charged with or convicted of any felony offense? For this item, report \ninformation regardless of whether the record in your case has been \n\"sealed\" or otherwise stricken from the record. The single exception to this \nrequirement is for certain convictions under the Federal Controlled \nSubstances Act for which the court issued an expungement order under \nthe authority of 21 U.S.C. 844 or 18 U.S.C. 3607.  \n \nQuestion 38.  Your Financial Delinquencies - 180 Days In the last 7 \nyears, have you been over 180 days delinquent on any debt(s)?  \n \nQuestion 39. Your Financial Delinquencies - 90 Days Are you currently \nover 90 days delinquent on any debt(s)?  \n \nApplicant was arrested on February 27, 1997, and charged with: (1) forgery 1st \ndegree, (2) theft 1st degree, (3) failure to appear 2nd degree and (4) negotiating a bad \ncheck. On February 12, 1998, he was convicted of negotiating a bad check, a felony, \nfined $1739.00, and sentenced to two years probation. \n \nApplicant was arrested on May 14, 1997, and charged with: (1) failure to appear \n1st degree, (2) forgery 1, and (3) failure to appear 1st degree theft I. On February 12, \n1998, he was convicted of failure to appear 1st degree, a felony, fined $669.00, and \nsentenced to two years probation, and forgery 1, a felony, fined $919.00, and sentenced \nto two years probation. \n \nThe two felony convictions resulted from thefts using a forged check from \nApplicant\u2019s father, and forgery of a credit card purchase (Tr. 39-41).  Applicant provided \nextenuating information concerning the felony convictions, essentially blaming his \nformer wife for the offenses. Id. In his SOR response he denied that he was aware of \nthe delinquent debt, and admitted the felony charges and convictions (Tr. 30-32, GE 1-\n2). He explained why he did not disclose the requested information about the felonies: \n \nI admit that the findings are in my past record.  I was instructed in writing, \nof which I unfortunately do not have copies of, when filling out the forms, \n\n \n7 \n                                                                                                                                                             \nwhile working [for a contractor overseas], to follow the instructions as \npresented.  I was to fill out these forms under the timeframe Year 2000 \u2013 \n2004. I followed the instructions as directed. I did not list these cases as it \ndid not fall into the instructed timeframe. \n \nGE 1-2. At his hearing, he described the circumstances of completing his SF 86 as \nfollows: \n \n.  .  .  I asked them when I was there, I said I - - I do have some things on \nmy record, I was not - - you know, I didn\u2019t tell them exactly what I had. The \ntime frame that they told me [about was] from 2000 and 2004[.] [W]hen we \nwere filling this out[, they said] to go back four years. I said I have some \nother things. Is that going to be a problem? And they said no. As we went \nthrough this, and again, this is what\u2019s really bad about this, is I\u2019m - - I\u2019m \nfollowing the direction that they were giving me and as they were telling \neverybody. They wanted the - - and their explanation for that, by the way, \nwas we need to get these through as fast as we can. Therefore, they said, \nfour years go back, do this. And that\u2019s what we turned in. \n     \nTr. 32-33. On February 19, 2008, I specifically asked Applicant by email to provide the \nname of any witness who could corroborate his statement about these instructions (GE \n6-V). At his hearing, he said his employer\u2019s security officers provided the instructions \nabout completing his SF 86 (Tr. 35-36). Applicant said he did not have any \ndocumentation to provide concerning the instructions he was given about completing \nthe SF 86 (Tr. 31).    \n \n \nIn regard to his failure to disclose his delinquent debts on his SF 86, he said he \nthought his employer paid the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e (Tr. 33).  He was not aware of the \nother debts (Tr. 33-34).   \n \nEmployee Performance  \n \nApplicant worked for his current employer in a combat zone and deserves \nsubstantial credit for his patriotism and dedication to the national defense (Tr. 42). He \nhas sacrificed for his country through his multiple overseas tours for nine years (Tr. 42-\n43). He enjoys contributing to the national defense. He receives satisfaction from \nsupporting his family and the troops in the combat zone (Tr. 42-44).  His supervisors are \npleased with his performance and are in the process of promoting him (Tr. 42-44).  His \nassistance is very important to the information technology mission in the combat zone \n(GE 10). \n \nPolicies \n \n \nIn an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s security suitability, an administrative judge must \nconsider Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which sets forth adjudicative guidelines. In \naddition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines \n\n \n8 \n                                                                                                                                                             \n                                                          \nare divided into disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used to \ndetermine an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge should apply \nthese guidelines in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process \nprovision in Section E2.2, Enclosure 2, of the Directive. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \n \nBecause the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d an administrative judge should consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. \n \nSince the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the \nfinal decision in each case is arrived at by applying the standard that the issuance of the \nclearance is \u201cclearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d11 The government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish \na potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive. Once the government has \nproduced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to produce evidence and prove a mitigating condition. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 \nprovides, \u201cThe applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to \nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by \nDepartment Counsel, and [applicant] has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to \nobtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d The burden of disproving a mitigating \ncondition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. \nSep. 22, 2005).12 \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. It is a \nrelationship that transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours \n \n11 \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as \nadequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-\n11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1).  \u201cThis is something less than the weight \nof the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not \nprevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime \nComm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966).  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a \npreponderance.\u201d  See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \n \n12\u201fThe Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and \nunfavorable, [evaluates] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the \nDirective, and [decides] whether Applicant [has] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d  \nISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006).  \n\n \n9 \n                                                                                                                                                             \nas well. It is because of this special relationship the government must be able to repose \na high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions under this Directive include, by necessity, \nconsideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to \nprotect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of \nlegally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise \nof classified information. \n  \nThe scope of an administrative judge\u2019s decision is limited. Applicant\u2019s allegiance, \nloyalty, and patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings.  Section 7 of Executive \nOrder 10865 specifically provides industrial security clearance decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d  See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. \nSecurity clearance decisions cover many characteristics of an applicant other than \nallegiance, loyalty, and patriotism.  Nothing in this Decision should be construed to \nsuggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied \ndetermination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly \nabove, I conclude the following with respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR: \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended \nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides two Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions that \ncould raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case, \u201c(a) inability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d  \nAG \u00b6 19(f), \u201cfinancial problems that are linked to drug abuse, alcoholism, gambling \nproblems, or other issues of security concern,\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(g), \u201cfailure to file annual \nFederal, state, or local income tax returns as required or the fraudulent filing of the \nsame\u201d do not apply.  Applicant does not have a problem with drug abuse, alcoholism, or \ngambling.  There is no evidence he failed to file his income tax returns. \n \nApplicant\u2019s history of delinquent debt is well documented; however, he deserves \ncredit for the progress he has made in the resolution of his debts. He established that \nhe paid the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.g on March 27, 2007. He has almost paid federal tax debt \n\n \n10 \n                                                                                                                                                             \ndescribed in SOR \u00b6 1.a. He has not made sufficient progress on his other five \ndelinquent debts, and they are currently delinquent. He has provided insufficient \ndocumentation to show progress resolving these five debts. The government \nestablished the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c).   \n \n  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)-(e) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant receives partial credit under AG \u00b6 19(b) because a condition that \ncaused some financial problems was largely beyond his control, that is, his difficult \nmarriage, and eventual divorce which ended it in 2003. He does not receive full credit \nbecause he did not act responsibly under the circumstances from 2003 to present. He \nwas employed and had the means to address his delinquent debt after he became \naware of his debts around June 29, 2007 (the SOR\u2019s date). He did not provide proof \nthat he made the first payment on these five debts prior to the date the record was \nclosed (on April 16, 2008). He did not do enough to resolve the five remaining \ndelinquent debts soon enough. \n \nApplicant said he disputed the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e. However, he did not provide \ncorrespondence with the creditor disputing this delinquent debt, as required by AG \u00b6 \n19(e). He did not establish that he made a good faith effort to repay the five delinquent \ndebts, or otherwise resolve them to a sufficient degree to mitigate them. His financial \nproblems are continuing and likely to recur. He should have been more diligent, providing \ndocumentation showing greater, more timely efforts to resolve his five delinquent debts. \nHe has not carried his burden of proving his financial responsibility. There are not clear \n\n \n11 \n                                                                                                                                                             \nindications his five delinquent debts are being resolved. His overall conduct with the five \ncreditors casts doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment, and I \nconclude no mitigating conditions fully apply. \n \n \nPersonal Conduct (Guideline E) \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning \nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent \nmedical authority, or other official government representative. \n \nApplicant\u2019s May 6, 2004 SF 86 asked about his delinquent debt. He answered, \n\u201cNo,\u201d and did not disclose the debts discussed in the previous section. However, his \nanswers were not deliberately false because he was unaware of his delinquent debts.  \nHe has successfully refuted this allegation.   \n \nApplicant\u2019s May 6, 2004 SF 86 asked, \u201cQuestion 21. Your Police Record \u2013 \nFelony Offenses Have you ever been charged with or convicted of any felony \noffense?\u201d He answered, \u201cNo,\u201d and did not disclose his two felony convictions. He \nprovided deliberately false information. His statement that he was told not to provide \ninformation about offenses prior to 2000 is not credible.  AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) and 16(b) apply. \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides seven conditions that could mitigate personal conduct security \nconcerns in this case: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \n\n \n12 \n                                                                                                                                                             \n                                                          \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully. \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or \noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules \nand regulations. \n  \nAs indicated previously, Applicant\u2019s answers about his delinquent debts were not \ndeliberately false because he was unaware of his delinquent debts. The allegations \nabout providing false answers to Questions 38 and 39 are unsubstantiated and \ntherefore mitigated under AG \u00b6 17(f). \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions in AG \u00b6 17 apply to his false answer to \nQuestion 21. Although Applicant\u2019s falsification of his SF 86 on May 6, 2004, is not \nrecent, he falsely stated that security officials told him not to include information about \noffenses prior to 2000. No one advised him to falsify his SF 86. His failure to present \ncorroboration about his allegation that security personnel told him not to list pre-2000 \noffenses or information is a minimal factor in this decision.13 He did not promptly inform \n \n13Administrative judges \u201cmust look at the record for corroboration of Applicant\u2019s testimony.\u201d ISCR \nCase 02-03186 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2006). Moreover, a judge may consider \u201cApplicant\u2019s failure to \npresent documentary evidence in corroboration of his denials and explanations.\u201d ISCR Case 01-20579 at \n5 (App. Bd. Apr. 14, 2004) (holding Applicant\u2019s failure to provide reasonably available corroborative \nevidence may be used in common sense evaluation to determine whether Applicant\u2019s claims are \nestablished). In ISCR Case 01-02677 at 7 (App. Bd. Oct. 17, 2002), the Appeal Board explained: \n \nWhile lack of corroboration can be a factor in evaluating the reliability or weight of \nevidence, lack of corroboration does not automatically render a piece of evidence \nsuspect, unreliable, or incredible. . . . Evidence that lacks corroboration must be \nevaluated in terms of its intrinsic believability and in light of all the other evidence of \n\n \n13 \n                                                                                                                                                             \nthe government of the falsification. He did not receive counseling designed to improve \nhis conduct. He admitted the information he provided about his two felonies was not \ncorrect, and the falsification of his SF 86 is substantiated. The falsification of his 2004 \nSF 86, as compounded by his statements blaming the falsification on security personnel \ncasts doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount \nconcern. The adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in \nconsidering the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by \nthe totality of his or her acts, omissions, and motivations as well as various other \nvariables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into consideration all \nrelevant circumstances and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful \nanalysis.  Under the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge should consider \nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at Directive \u00b6 E2.2.1:  \n \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) The \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) The frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) The \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) The \nvoluntariness of participation; (6) The presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) The motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) The likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E2.2.3, \u201cThe ultimate determination of whether the granting or \ncontinuing of eligibility for a security clearance is clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security must be an overall common sense determination based upon careful \nconsideration\u201d of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nApplicant went through a difficult marriage and divorce. Delinquent debt resulted \nin the 1999 to 2003 timeframe. He paid $222 in March 2007, resolving the debt in SOR \n\u00b6 1.g. He paid some of the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a, and has a well-established payment plan \nfor the remainder of this $5,512 federal tax debt. In the last 90 days he has contacted \nthe other creditors, and will soon begin his payment plan on his state tax debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.b to 1.d), as well as his other two creditors holding delinquent debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and \n1.f).  He has earned substantial credit for his service to his country overseas for many \nyears, especially his current service in a combat zone.    \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                           \nrecord, including evidence that tends to support it as well as evidence that tends to \ndetract from it. \n \nI recognize Applicant is assigned overseas in a combat zone and obtaining corroboration from other \nemployees about the advice of security personnel would be difficult. Accordingly, the absence of \ncorroboration in this case is a much lesser factor than it would otherwise be.  \n \n\n \n14 \n                                                                                                                                                             \n                                                          \nApplicant did not provide evidence that he did anything to resolve his debts until \nabout 90 days ago. He did not act responsibly after he became fully employed and \nreceived the SOR to resolve five delinquent debts. His failure to show financial \nresponsibility is a much lesser security concern than his falsification of his SF 86, \ncompounded by his false explanation about receiving bad advice from security personnel. \n \nApplicant deliberately failed to disclose his two felonies on his 2004 security \nclearance application. This falsification has a serious negative impact on my security \nclearance determination because it damages his integrity and trustworthiness. He said \nsecurity personnel told him not to list conduct prior to 2000, and his two felony convictions \noccurred in 1998. His false statement about receiving this bad advice on March 20, 2008, \nis recent. An Applicant should not receive a clearance when they provide recent, false \nexplanations for failing to disclose information on their SF 86.     \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d14 and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, all the evidence in this decision (especially his contributions to his employer and \nhis country, while serving in a combat zone) and my interpretation of my responsibilities \nunder the Guidelines. For the reasons stated, I conclude he is not eligible for access to \nclassified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b to 1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.g: ` \n \nFor Applicant \n  \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:    \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.b and 2.c: \n For Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact9 In his SOR response, Applicant admitted responsibility for the federal and state tax debts listed in the SOR, and that he did not disclose his debts and two felonies on his 2004 SF 86. He said he did not intend to deceive the government. Applicant explained why he believed the security concerns were mitigated. His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 52 years old (Tr1. 4, Tr2. 6).10 He married in 1996 and divorced in 2000. He remarried in 2003. He served on active duty from 1978 to 1982 in the Navy. He has two years of college and some subsequent college credits equivalent to four years of college (Tr1. 4, Tr2. 6). He has been employed by government contractors since 1998 (Tr1. 17-18, Tr2. 7), and began working for the current government contractor on November 30, 2006 (Tr1. 17). Applicant does not have a clearance (Tr1. 5-6, Tr2. 7). He has been married four times, and his most recent marriage occurred in 2003 (Tr1. 37-38, Tr2. 7-8). Applicant\u2018s two children were born in 1997 and 2005 (Tr1. 38, Tr2. 8). 9 The facts in this decision do not specifically describe employment or locations in order to protect Applicant and his family\u2019s privacy.

Noel, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n__________ \n \nDecision \n__________ \n \n \nHARVEY, Mark W., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant failed to mitigate security concerns regarding personal conduct and \nfinancial considerations. He knowingly and deliberately failed to disclose two felony \nconvictions on his security clearance application. He also failed to resolve one debt for \n$8,708 to a credit card company. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn May 6, 2004, Applicant submitted a Security Clearance Application (e-QIP \nversion) (hereinafter SF 86) (Government Exhibit (GE) 1-4). On June 29, 2007, the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \nto him,1 pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within \nIndustry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified. The SOR \n \n1Government Exhibit (GE) 1-1 (Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated June 29, 2007). GE 1-1 is \nthe source for the facts in the remainder of this paragraph unless stated otherwise. \nDecember 10, 2008\n\n \n2 \n                                                                                                                                             \n                                           \nalleges security concerns under Guidelines F (Financial Considerations), and E \n(Personal Conduct).2 The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the \npreliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for him, and recommended \nreferral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, \ncontinued, denied, or revoked. \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR allegations, and elected to have his case \ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.3 A complete copy of the file of \nrelevant material (FORM), dated November 1, 2007, was provided to him, and he was \nafforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, \nor mitigation.4 On December 10, 2007, Applicant requested a 90-day delay to submit his \nresponse to the FORM (GE 5 at 3). Department Counsel concurred with a 30-day delay, \nbut objected to a 90-day delay (GE 5). On January 15, 2008, the case was assigned to \nme. For at least a year prior to his March 20, 2008, proceeding, Applicant was assigned \nto a combat zone overseas, and collection of evidence was difficult for him (Tr. 22-23). \nAfter a series of e-mail communications, Applicant requested to provide a statement in \nthe format of a teleconference. In an e-mail dated March 19, 2007 (GE 7), Applicant \nstated: \n \nI appreciate everyone's efforts [to attempt to arrange a video \nteleconference (VTC)). It looks like the VTC isn't going to work out as well \nas we had planned. I will put this in writing so everyone will know that I am \nrequesting this. I [Applicant\u2019s name], am requesting a tele-conference for \nmy interview with the personnel listed in this email. My VTC personnel \nhere will email you with the phone number to the room I will be using for \nthis tele-conference. I look forward to speaking with you.5 \n \n2On Aug. 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a memorandum \ndirecting application of revised Adjudicative Guideline to all adjudications and other determinations made \nunder the Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program \n(Regulation), dated Jan. 1987, as amended, in which the SOR was issued on or after Sep. 1, 2006. The \nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines are applicable to Applicant\u2019s case because his SOR was issued after \nSep. 1, 2006. \n \n3GE 1-2 (Applicant\u2019s undated response to SOR).   \n \n4The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) transmittal letter informed Applicant that \nhe had 30 days after Applicant\u2019s receipt to submit information. \n \n5At the hearing the following exchange occurred: \n \nAdministrative Judge:  . . . I want to make it clear that [Applicant] has requested that we \ndo a speaker, non-video type hearing today.  Is that correct, [Applicant]? \n \nApplicant: That is correct, sir. \n \nAdministrative Judge: You understand that under the Directive, you have a right to an in-\nperson hearing or at least a video teleconference type hearing.  Is that correct? \n \nApplicant: Yes. \n\n \n3 \n                                                                                                                                             \n                                                                                                                                            \nThe teleconference proceeding itself was conducted in a manner consistent with \na typical DOHA security clearance hearing; however, it was not a hearing as I could not \nobserve Applicant\u2019s demeanor during the interview. This interview was conducted on \nMarch 20, 2008. There were no objections to my consideration of GEs 1-6 (Transcript \n(Tr1.) 11). The interview transcript was received on March 28, 2008. Applicant\u2019s final \nsubmissions were received on April 5 and 16, 2008 (GE 8 and 9).  There were no \nobjections to my consideration of GE 8 and 9, and they are admitted.  \n \nProcedural Rulings \n \nDepartment Counsel objected to my communications with Applicant using e-mail \n(with a copy electronically provided to Department Counsel), arguing such a procedure \nis not permitted under the Directive and is unfair to the Government. Department \nCounsel recommended selection of one of three options: (1) use of video \nteleconference (VTC), (2) delay until in-person presentation or (3) close of the record \nwithout further presentation of evidence.  \n \nDepartment Counsel contended use of e-mail to collect evidence6 is too helpful \nto the Applicant because the process will reveal how disqualifying conditions might be \nmitigated,7 and unfairly facilitates gathering and presenting documentary evidence.  \nMoreover, it does not permit Applicant\u2019s cross-examination, or observation of an \nApplicant\u2019s demeanor.   \n \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s observations about the limitations of written evidence and \ne-mail in regard to cross-examination and assessment of demeanor are well taken. At \n \n \nAdministrative Judge: And knowing you have those rights, you\u2019ve decided to waive those \nrights and present your case in the format of a speaker hearing.  Is that correct? \n \nApplicant: That\u2019s correct. \n \nTr1. 13-14.    \n \n6 An Administrative Judge has some discretion to research issues, especially to protect the rights \nof a pro se Applicant, so long as the product of the research if used to decide an issue is provided to the \nparties, and the parties have an opportunity to comment on the information. See Hines v. Department of \nHealth and Human Services, 21 Cl.Ct. 634 (1990); Illinois v. Swart, 860 N.E.2d 1142 (Ill. App. 2006), but \nsee Kershner v. Massanari, 16 Fed. Appx 606 (9th Cir. 2001) (unpublished opinion) (stating the \nadministrative law judge (ALJ) \u201cshould not have gone outside the record to perform his own medical \nresearch,\u201d and noting the ALJ incorrectly applied a medical summary of an article to determine a pro se \nclaimant was not credible without providing the article to the parties). See, e.g., Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, 548 \nU.S. 547 (2006) (providing an example of an appellate decision with numerous citations to internet \ndocuments). \n \n7 \u201c[A]n ALJ has a heightened obligation to assist a pro se claimant, in particular to \"assist [him or \nher] affirmatively in developing the record.\" Carroll v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, 872 \nF.Supp. 1200, 1204 (E.D.N.Y. 1995) (citing Smith v. Bowen, 687 F.Supp. 902, 906 (S.D.N.Y. 1998)). \n\u201cEspecially where an unrepresented claimant's record is inconsistent and incomplete, an ALJ must \n\u2018scrupulously and conscientiously probe into, inquire of and explore all the relevant facts.\u2019\u201d Id. (Citing \nHankerson v. Harris, 636 F.2d 893, 895 (2d Cir. 1980)). See also Garrett v. Richardson, 363 F. Supp. 83 \n(E.D.S.C. 1973) (discussing ALJ\u2019s responsibility to obtain reports for full and fair hearing).   \n\n \n4 \n                                                                                                                                             \n                                           \nmost, e-mail and speaker phone evidence presentations are not equivalent to in-person \ntestimony and do not constitute a \u201chearing.\u201d The cross-examination and full evaluation \nof demeanor and credibility through a hearing are critical due process components.  \nHowever, Applicant can waive his hearing as under the FORM process and in this case \naffirmatively chose to do so.8   \n \nI overruled Department Counsel\u2019s motion to preclude consideration of e-mailed \ninformation. The Directive does not address methods of collecting evidence such as \nVTC, e-mail and speaker phones. Moreover, VTC is routinely used and encouraged to \nconduct hearings because travel expenses are saved. E-mail and speaker phones \nshould also be encouraged as a substitute for written correspondence as they allow an \nalmost real time response and more timely clarification, speeding the processing of \ncases without compromising the quality of the evidence received.   \n \nOn April 28, 2008, I denied Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified \ninformation. Applicant appealed my decision to the DOHA Appeal Board.     \n \nAppeal Board\u2019s Remand and Subsequent Processing \n \nThe Appeal Board remanded Applicant\u2019s case stating: \n \nGiven Applicant\u2019s pro se status, the likely exigencies of communicating to \nDOHA from a war zone, and the circumstances highlighted above, a \nreasonable person could conclude that Applicant\u2019s waiver of his right to a \nhearing was not sufficiently knowing so as to satisfy the due process \nrequirements of Directive. Accordingly, the Board concludes that the best \ncourse of action is to remand the case to the Judge for a new proceeding, \neither a determination on the written record or a hearing that complies with \nthe requirements of the Directive (making appropriate allowances given \nApplicant\u2019s presence in a conflict zone).  \n \nISCR Case No. 06-13610 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 31, 2008). \n \n \n8The Appeal Board remanded Applicant\u2019s case because the Appeal Board wanted to protect \nApplicant\u2019s due process rights, determining that his waiver of a hearing was not sufficiently knowing and \nciting his presence in Afghanistan (a combat zone) when he rendered his waiver. Unfortunately, the \nAppeal Board did not articulate why a waiver of a hearing in the context of a DOHA FORM proceeding is \nmore knowing than the process used in Applicant\u2019s first proceeding. Moreover, Applicant received more \ndue process in his first proceeding than an Applicant receives under the FORM process. In any event, it is \nclear that Applicant understood his March 20, 2008, proceeding did not involve observation of his \ndemeanor because he was well aware when the video portion of the teleconference became unavailable \nat his Afghanistan location. Applicant has four years of college and works in information technology. He \nknew what was occurring and waived the video portion both orally and in writing. He chose to proceed \nwith the teleconference proceeding without video. Nevertheless, I welcome the Appeal Board\u2019s remand \nbecause it provides an opportunity to determine whether Applicant has made progress resolving financial \nor personal conduct concerns, or has developed new evidence supporting or corroborating his positions \non security concerns. A hearing adds the most important element to Applicant\u2019s clearance determination, \nwhich is a credibility evaluation. \n\n \n5 \n                                                                                                                                             \n                                           \nAfter Applicant received the Appeal Board\u2019s remand, he requested a hearing. \nApplicant waived his right to the 15-days notice and his hearing was held on November \n18, 2008 (Tr2. 21-22, Remand AE D, E). The parties did not object to consideration of \nthe same documents that were admitted in the previous proceeding, and I admitted \nthose same documents with the same exhibit numbers (Tr2. 16-19). The parties did not \nobject to admission of the transcript from the prior proceeding, and I admitted it (Tr2. \n20). References to the pages in the prior proceeding are marked \u201cTr1.\u201d and references  \nto the hearing on November 18, 2008, are designated \u201cTr2.\u201d  Applicant did not object to \nanything in the first decision rendered aside from wanting a hearing so that his \ncredibility could be evaluated (Tr2. 52).   \n \nI approved a post-hearing delay until December 2, 2008, for Applicant to provide \nadditional documentation concerning his case (Tr2. 44-45, 59). Applicant said that \nwould be \u201cplenty of time.\u201d (Tr2. 45). I emailed the transcript of the hearing to Applicant \nas he requested (Tr2. 6, 45). On December 1, 2008, Applicant provided a copy of his \nopening statement as an attachment to an email (Remand AE A). From December 2 to \nDecember 2-6, 2008, the parties sent several emails (AE B-C). All documentation \nApplicant submitted was admitted into evidence AE A-C, and I closed the record on \nDecember 8, 2008.   \n \nFindings of Fact9 \n \nIn his SOR response, Applicant admitted responsibility for the federal and state \ntax debts listed in the SOR, and that he did not disclose his debts and two felonies on \nhis 2004 SF 86. He said he did not intend to deceive the government. Applicant \nexplained why he believed the security concerns were mitigated. His admissions are \nincorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the \nevidence of record, I make the following findings of fact.  \n \nApplicant is 52 years old (Tr1. 4, Tr2. 6).10 He married in 1996 and divorced in \n2000. He remarried in 2003. He served on active duty from 1978 to 1982 in the Navy. \nHe has two years of college and some subsequent college credits equivalent to four \nyears of college (Tr1. 4, Tr2. 6). He has been employed by government contractors \nsince 1998 (Tr1. 17-18, Tr2. 7), and began working for the current government \ncontractor on November 30, 2006 (Tr1. 17). Applicant does not have a clearance (Tr1. \n5-6, Tr2. 7). He has been married four times, and his most recent marriage occurred in \n2003 (Tr1. 37-38, Tr2. 7-8).  Applicant\u2018s two children were born in 1997 and 2005 (Tr1. \n38, Tr2. 8). \n \n \n \n \n9 The facts in this decision do not specifically describe employment or locations in order to protect \nApplicant and his family\u2019s privacy. The cited sources contain more specific information.  \n \n10 Applicant\u2019s SF 86 (GE 1-4) is the source for the facts in this paragraph, unless stated \notherwise. \n \n\n \n6 \n                                                                                                                                             \nFinancial Considerations (Guideline F) \n \nApplicant\u2019s SOR lists seven debts. On January 31, 2008, Applicant sent an e-\nmail which includes the statement, \u201cI have been making payments to clear my debts, \nand as they are completed, I have asked them to send me documentation for the \npayment in full and that my matters with these debts are cleared.\u201d (GE 10). Specific \ninformation about each debt follows: \n \nFor SOR \u00b6 1.a, a Federal tax lien was filed against Applicant on April 27, 1998, in \nthe amount of $5,512.  He filed his federal tax returns, and was unclear about why there \nwas a federal tax lien (Tr1. 19-23). His federal tax lien was paid by payroll deduction in \nAugust or September 2008 (Tr2. 29, 34-35). On November 18, 2008, he said he wrote \nthe IRS about three months ago requesting a letter releasing the debt (Tr2. 35). On \nDecember 4, 2008, Applicant said in an email that he had \u201cpaystubs\u201d showing \n\u201cpayments for Federal taxes paid.\u201d He then offered to email his proof to me (Remand \nAE B). I asked him to immediately do so (Remand AE B).  However, I did not \nsubsequently receive any Federal tax-related evidence from Applicant.  \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b to 1.d list state tax liens filed on November 15, 1999, in the amounts \nof $911; $1,591; and $1,814. Applicant remembered when he filed his Oregon state tax \nreturn in 1998 he owed less than $1,000 (Tr1. 20). He suspected that his former spouse \n(who also charged $20,000 in bills when she visited his overseas location in the late \n1990s) took the money that was supposed to be paid to Oregon (Tr1. 21).  Around mid-\nJanuary 2008, Applicant\u2019s cousin contacted the state of Oregon to obtain information \nabout his state tax debt (Tr1. 21-22). At his hearing on November 18, 2008, Applicant \nsaid he sent his cousin the funds and his Oregon state taxes are paid (Tr2. 29, 35-36). \nHe asked his cousin to provide proof that the debt was paid (Tr2. 36). On December 4, \n2008, Applicant said in an email that he had \u201cpaystubs\u201d reflecting \u201cpartial payments to \nthe state of Oregon, which shows about half of the payments, as the rest was paid in \ncash directly to the state office.\u201d He then emailed his proof to me, which consisted of \npay stubs showing in October 2008 he paid $3,000 to the state of Oregon as a tax \ndeduction (Remand AE B). On December 6, 2008, he also sent an email indicating he \nseparately and directly sent $1,326 and $648.90 to Oregon for taxes (Remand AE B).    \n \nFor SOR debts \u00b6\u00b6 1.a to 1.d, Applicant said he was not notified of these debts \nand was unaware of them (GE 1-2). In his response to interrogatories, dated April 3, \n2007, he said for SOR debts \u00b6 1.a, he was overseas for the past nine years and was tax \nexempt (GE 1-5). On April 15, 2008, in an email he said the federal and state taxes \nowed are being resolved using direct withdrawal from his bi-weekly pay (GE 6). He \nprovided his pay statement showing a payment of $1,394 towards his federal tax debt \n(GE 6). His next five pay statements will result in full payment of his federal tax debt \n(GE 6). His state tax payments should appear on his April 2008 pay statement (GE 7).    \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e describes Applicant\u2019s credit card account, which became delinquent in \n2002 in the amount of about $8,708. Applicant said he charged travel expenses \nincurred on behalf of his employer, and he believed his employer was responsible for \npaying the creditor (Tr1. 24-26). In his response to the SOR and to interrogatories, he \n\n \n7 \n                                                                                                                                             \nsaid his employer told Applicant that this debt was resolved in 2003 (GE 2, 5). In his \nresponse to interrogatories, dated April 3, 2007, he said he was \u201ctaking action to rectify \nthis situation and have it removed from [his] files\u201d (GE 5). In his SOR response he \npromised to investigate removal of this delinquent debt from his records (GE 1-2). On \nFebruary 19, 2008, I specifically asked Applicant by email to provide copies of \ndocumentation he used to investigate and dispute this debt (GE 6-V). On March 20, \n2008, he said he contacted the creditor and the creditor was attempting to obtain \nresolution from his former employer (Tr1. 24). He told the creditor he would pay the \ndebt, and the creditor offered to cut the debt by one third (Tr1. 25). Applicant had no \ncorrespondence with the creditor\u2014all of his communications with the creditor were \nverbal, over the telephone (Tr1. 25). On April 15, 2008, in an email he said the creditor \n\u201care/have sent me a settlement that would be reimbursed in the event [his former \nemployer] were to pay off this debt.\u201d (GE 6). At his hearing on November 18, 2008, \nApplicant said the credit card company told him not to pay the debt because it would be \n\u201cvery difficult\u201d to obtain a refund if his former employer paid the debt (Tr2. 30). Applicant \nclaimed the creditor offered to provide correspondence documenting their advice not to \npay their bill (Tr2. 36). Applicant did not provide any such documentation concerning \nthis creditor\u2019s proposal.  \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.g are two credit card accounts, which became delinquent in \n2003 in the amounts of $772 and $516. In Applicant\u2019s SOR response, he said his former \nspouse incurred these debts without his knowledge and he paid them in March 2007 \n(GE 1-2). At his hearing, he said his wife was responsible for one account, he was \nresponsible for the other, and both were taken care of (Tr1. 28). On January 31, 2008, \nApplicant provided a letter from the creditor indicating that an account from the creditor \nfor $222 was settled and paid on March 26, 2007 (Tr1. 28, GE 6-C). The account \nnumber in GE 6-C matches the account number in the credit report for the $516 debt, \nand I find \u201cFor Applicant\u201d on SOR \u00b6 1.g (Tr1. 28-29, GE 1-10 at 2). On February 19, \n2008, I asked Applicant by e-mail to provide documentation showing proof of payment \nfor the other debt (GE 6-V). On April 15, 2008, he said in an email, \u201cA settlement is \nbeing sent me which when paid will be considered paid in full.\u201d (GE 6). On November \n18, 2008, he said the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f was \u201ccleared,\u201d and he promised to provide \ncorroborating documentation to support resolution of this debt (Tr2. 31, 37); however, \nhe did not provide any such documentation after his hearing.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s pay statement for April 3, 2008, shows bi-weekly pay of $5,104 (GE \n6). He said he worked very diligently from December 2007 to March 20, 2008 (the date \nteleconference statement) to investigate and resolve his delinquent debts (Tr1. 23-24).  \nHe promised \u201c100 percent to take care of\u201d his debts (Tr1. 24).   \n \nPersonal Conduct (Guideline E) \n    \n \nApplicant answered, \u201cNo\u201d on his SF 86, executed on May 6, 2004, to three \nquestions that are relevant to the issue of whether Applicant falsified his SF 86: \n \nQuestion 21. Your Police Record \u2013 Felony Offenses Have you ever \nbeen charged with or convicted of any felony offense? For this item, report \n\n \n8 \n                                                                                                                                             \ninformation regardless of whether the record in your case has been \n\"sealed\" or otherwise stricken from the record. The single exception to this \nrequirement is for certain convictions under the Federal Controlled \nSubstances Act for which the court issued an expungement order under \nthe authority of 21 U.S.C. 844 or 18 U.S.C. 3607.  \n \nQuestion 38.  Your Financial Delinquencies-180 Days In the last 7 \nyears, have you been over 180 days delinquent on any debt(s)?  \n \nQuestion 39. Your Financial Delinquencies-90 Days Are you currently \nover 90 days delinquent on any debt(s)?  \n \nApplicant was arrested on February 27, 1997, and charged with: (1) forgery 1st \ndegree, (2) theft 1st degree, (3) failure to appear 2nd degree and (4) negotiating a bad \ncheck. On February 12, 1998, he was convicted of negotiating a bad check, a felony, \nfined $1739.00, and sentenced to two years probation. \n \nApplicant was arrested on May 14, 1997, and charged with: (1) failure to appear \n1st degree, (2) forgery 1, and (3) failure to appear 1st degree theft I. On February 12, \n1998, he was convicted of (1) failure to appear 1st degree, a felony, fined $669.00, and \nsentenced to two years probation, and (2) forgery 1, a felony, fined $919.00, and \nsentenced to two years probation. \n \nThe two felony convictions resulted from thefts using a forged check from \nApplicant\u2019s father, and forgery of a credit card purchase (Tr1. 39-41). Applicant provided \nextenuating information concerning the felony convictions, essentially blaming his \nformer wife for the offenses. Id. In his SOR response he denied that he was aware of \nthe delinquent debt, and admitted the felony charges and convictions (Tr1. 30-32, GE 1-\n2). He explained why he did not disclose the requested information about the felonies:  \n \nI admit that the findings are in my past record.  I was instructed in writing, \nof which I unfortunately do not have copies of, when filling out the forms, \nwhile working [for a contractor overseas], to follow the instructions as \npresented. I was to fill out these forms under the timeframe Year 2000 \u2013 \n2004. I followed the instructions as directed. I did not list these cases as it \ndid not fall into the instructed timeframe. \n \nGE 1-2. At his proceeding on March 20, 2008, he described the circumstances of \ncompleting his SF 86 as follows: \n \n.  .  .  I asked them when I was there, I said I - - I do have some things on \nmy record, I was not - - you know, I didn\u2019t tell them exactly what I had. The \ntime frame that they told me [about was] from 2000 and 2004[.] [W]hen we \nwere filling this out [, they said] to go back four years. I said I have some \nother things. Is that going to be a problem? And they said no. As we went \nthrough this, and again, this is what\u2019s really bad about this, is I\u2019m - - I\u2019m \nfollowing the direction that they were giving me and as they were telling \n\n \n9 \n                                                                                                                                             \neverybody. They wanted the - - and their explanation for that, by the way, \nwas we need to get these through as fast as we can. Therefore, they said, \nfour years go back, do this. And that\u2019s what we turned in. \n     \nTr1. 32-33. On February 19, 2008, I specifically asked Applicant by email to provide the \nname of any witness who could corroborate his statement about these instructions (GE \n6-V). At his March 20, 2008, proceeding, he said his employer\u2019s security officers \nprovided the instructions about completing his SF 86 (Tr1. 35-36). Applicant said he did \nnot have any documentation to provide concerning the instructions he was given about \ncompleting the SF 86 (Tr1. 31).  \n \nIn regard to Applicant\u2019s failure to disclose his delinquent debts on his SF 86, he \nsaid he thought his employer paid the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e (Tr1. 33).  He was not aware of \nthe other debts (Tr1. 33-34).   \n \n \nAt his hearing on November 18, 2008, Applicant said he downloaded and set up \nthe electronic 2004 SF 86 for his employer (Tr2. 31, 38). Security personnel orally \nasked the questions, and then the security personnel filled out the 2004 SF 86s for the \nemployees based on their responses (Tr. 37). He insisted the security personnel limited \nthe questions about criminal conduct to any arrests and felonies in the last four years \n(Tr2. 32). He volunteered to the security personnel that he had felonies prior to 2000 \nand they \u201ckind of yelled at [him], at that point,\u201d and they directed him to answer the \nquestions as they asked them (Tr2. 33). Applicant claimed, \u201cI disclosed [the felonies] to \nthem. But they said that is not our concern. Our concern is 2000. Listen and follow the \ninstructions. They kind of yelled at me.\u201d (Tr2. 43). \n \nApplicant said he never saw the hard copy of the SF 86 in 2004 (Tr2. 38); \nhowever, later he said he had an unsigned copy of his 2004 SF 86, which he provided \nto his new employer (Tr2. 41). He claimed the 2004 SF 86 he provided to his new \nemployer was unsigned (Tr2. 41). He denied that he signed the 2004 SF 86 in 2004 \n(Tr2. 38-41). Applicant said the signature that appears on his 2004 SF 86 was actually \nmade on the 2004 SF 86 in 2006 when he signed the 2004 SF 86 before providing the \nversion in the record to his new federal-contractor employer (Tr2. 40-41). His new \nemployer told him to backdate the 2004 SF 86 (Tr2. 40-42). He promised to provide an \nemail he sent to his new employer asking whether he should sign the 2004 SF 86 and \nabout what date he should put next to his signature (Tr2. 41-42). However, he did not \nprovide the email after his hearing. He read the 2004 SF 86 before he submitted it in \n2006, and his new employer told him not to change his answers (Tr2. 46). He told his \ncurrent employer about the felonies, and Applicant promised to seek a statement from \nhis current employer corroborating his account (Tr. 47). He never mentioned the \nbackdated signature on his 2004 SF 86 before his November 18, 2008, hearing \nbecause he never realized it before and it never crossed his mind before (Tr2. 42). He \nnever filled out a job application when he was hired by his current employer, and was \nhired based on a recommendation (Tr2. 47-48).  Accordingly, he did not have an \nopportunity to disclose his felonies on a job application to be hired by his current \nemployer.      \n \n\n \n10 \n                                                                                                                                             \n \nApplicant was unable to obtain evidence corroborating his description of the \nadvice security officers provided in 2004 and 2006 about completion of SF 86s (Tr2. \n43). \n \nEmployee Performance  \n \n \nApplicant said the generals on down to the lieutenants in the combat zone are \ndepending on Applicant to continue his work in the combat zone (Tr2. 48). His skill is \nunique (Tr2. 48). The government spent millions of dollars on two products that are \nineffective at stopping a very significant virus that attacks through USB devices, and \nApplicant created a product that does work (Tr2. 49).  \n \nApplicant worked for his current employer in a combat zone and deserves \nsubstantial credit for his patriotism and dedication to the national defense (Tr1. 42). He \nhas sacrificed for his country through his multiple overseas tours for nine years (Tr1. 42-\n43). He enjoys contributing to the national defense. He receives satisfaction from \nsupporting his family and the troops in the combat zone (Tr1. 42-44).  His supervisors \nare pleased with his performance and are in the process of promoting him (Tr1. 42-44).  \nHis assistance is very important to the information technology mission in the combat \nzone (GE 10). \n \nPolicies \n \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the Applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \n\n \n11 \n                                                                                                                                             \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the [A]pplicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, \nnothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, \nin whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, \nloyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has not met the strict \nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a \nclearance. \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the Applicant that may disqualify the Applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an Applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the Applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An Applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly \nabove, I conclude the following with respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR: \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended \nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \n \n\n \n12 \n                                                                                                                                             \nAG \u00b6 19 provides three Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions that \ncould potentially raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case, \u201c(a) \ninability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial \nobligations.\u201d  \n \nApplicant\u2019s history of delinquent debt is well documented; however, he deserves \ncredit for the progress he has made in the resolution of his debts. He established that \nhe paid the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.g on March 27, 2007. I am satisfied he paid his federal and \nOregon state tax debts described in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, and 1.d. He has not made \nsufficient progress on his debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e, and it is currently delinquent. He has \nprovided insufficient documentation to show progress resolving the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e. \nThe government established the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c).   \n \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)-(e) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant receives partial credit under AG \u00b6 19(b) because a condition that caused \nsome financial problems was largely beyond his control, that is, his difficult marriages, \nand eventual divorces (his most recent divorce was in 2003). Overall he showed some \nfinancial responsibility when he paid most of his delinquent debts, except for his credit \ncard debt when he was employed by his former employer (SOR \u00b6 1.e).  \n \nHowever, financial considerations cannot be mitigated because he was employed \nand had the means to address the delinquent debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e, especially after he \nbecame aware that this debt was a security concern around June 29, 2007 (the SOR\u2019s \n\n \n13 \n                                                                                                                                             \ndate). He did not provide proof that he disputed the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e as required by AG \n\u00b6 19(e). He did not do enough to resolve the $8,708 debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e.  \n \nIn sum, Applicant did not establish that he made a good faith effort to repay the \ndebt in SOR \u00b6 1.e, or otherwise resolve it to a sufficient degree to mitigate it. His financial \nproblems are continuing and likely to recur. He should have been more diligent, providing \ndocumentation showing greater and more timely efforts to resolve this delinquent debt. \nHe has not carried his burden of proving his financial responsibility. There are not clear \nindications his debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e is being resolved. His overall conduct with the creditor in \nSOR \u00b6 1.e casts doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment and I \nconclude no mitigating conditions fully apply. \n \nPersonal Conduct (Guideline E) \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning \nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent \nmedical authority, or other official government representative. \n \nApplicant\u2019s May 6, 2004, SF 86 asked about his delinquent debt. He answered, \n\u201cNo,\u201d and did not disclose the debts discussed in the previous section. However, his \nanswers were not deliberately false because he was unaware of his delinquent debts.  \nHe has successfully refuted this allegation.   \n \nApplicant\u2019s May 6, 2004, SF 86 asked, \u201cQuestion 21. Your Police Record \u2013 \nFelony Offenses Have you ever been charged with or convicted of any felony \noffense?\u201d He answered, \u201cNo,\u201d and did not disclose his two felony convictions. He \nprovided deliberately false information. His statement that he was told not to provide \ninformation about offenses prior to 2000 is not credible.  AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) and 16(b) apply. \n \n\n \n14 \n                                                                                                                                             \nAG \u00b6 17 provides seven conditions that could mitigate personal conduct security \nconcerns in this case: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress;  \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or \noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules \nand regulations. \n  \nAs indicated previously, Applicant\u2019s answers about his delinquent debts were not \ndeliberately false because he was unaware of his delinquent debts. The allegations \nabout providing false answers to Questions 38 and 39 are unsubstantiated and \ntherefore mitigated under AG \u00b6 17(f). \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions in AG \u00b6 17 apply to his false answer to \nQuestion 21. Although Applicant\u2019s falsification of his SF 86 on May 6, 2004, is not \nrecent, he falsely stated at his 2008 hearing that security officials told him not to include \ninformation about offenses prior to 2000. I do not believe his claim that security \npersonnel told him not to include his pre-2000 felonies on his SF 86. His failure to \npresent corroboration about his allegation that security personnel told him not to list pre-\n2000 offenses or information is a minimal factor in this decision because I recognize \n\n \n15 \n                                                                                                                                             \nthat security personnel are unlikely to admit such malfeasance.11 I primarily base my \nopinion that he was not truthful at his hearing on November 18, 2008, on his demeanor, \nand his new, implausible story that security personnel at his new employer told him in \n2006 not to disclose his felonies. It is simply not credible that two different security \nofficers at two different companies would tell Applicant not to disclose expressly \nrequested information on a security clearance application.  \n \nApplicant did not promptly inform the government of the falsification. He did not \nreceive counseling designed to improve his conduct. He admitted the information he \nprovided on his security clearance application about his two felonies was not correct, \nand the falsification of his SF 86 is substantiated. The falsification of his 2004 SF 86, as \ncompounded by his statements blaming the falsification on security personnel at two \ndifferent companies casts doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount \nconcern. The adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in \nconsidering the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by \nthe totality of his or her acts, omissions, and motivations as well as various other \nvariables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into consideration all \nrelevant circumstances and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful \nanalysis.  Under the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge should consider \nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at Directive \u00b6 E2.2.1:  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the \nvoluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \n                                            \n11Administrative judges \u201cmust look at the record for corroboration of Applicant\u2019s testimony.\u201d ISCR \nCase 02-03186 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2006). Moreover, a judge may consider \u201cApplicant\u2019s failure to \npresent documentary evidence in corroboration of his denials and explanations.\u201d ISCR Case 01-20579 at \n5 (App. Bd. Apr. 14, 2004) (holding Applicant\u2019s failure to provide reasonably available corroborative \nevidence may be used in common sense evaluation to determine whether Applicant\u2019s claims are \nestablished). In ISCR Case 01-02677 at 7 (App. Bd. Oct. 17, 2002), the Appeal Board explained: \n \nWhile lack of corroboration can be a factor in evaluating the reliability or weight of \nevidence, lack of corroboration does not automatically render a piece of evidence \nsuspect, unreliable, or incredible. . . . Evidence that lacks corroboration must be \nevaluated in terms of its intrinsic believability and in light of all the other evidence of \nrecord, including evidence that tends to support it as well as evidence that tends to \ndetract from it. \n \nI recognize Applicant is assigned overseas in a combat zone and obtaining corroboration from other \nemployees about the advice of security personnel would be difficult. Accordingly, the absence of \ncorroboration in this case is a much lesser factor than it would otherwise be.  \n \n\n \n16 \n                                                                                                                                             \nand other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E2.2.3, \u201cThe ultimate determination of whether the granting or \ncontinuing of eligibility for a security clearance is clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security must be an overall common sense determination based upon careful \nconsideration\u201d of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nApplicant went through several difficult marriages and divorces. Delinquent debt \nresulted in the 1999 to 2003 timeframe, and his most recent divorce was in 2003. He \npaid $222 in March 2007, resolving the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.g. He paid the debt in SOR \u00b6 \n1.a ($5,512 federal tax debt). He said he gave the money to his cousin to pay his \nOregon state tax debt (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b to 1.d). On December 4, 2008, he said he had \n\u201cpaystubs\u201d showing \u201cpartial payments to the state of Oregon, which shows about half of \nthe payments, as the rest was paid in cash directly to the state office.\u201d On December 6, \n2008, he emailed some pay information showing he paid the state of Oregon $3,000 in \nOctober 2008 as an \u201cOregon State Deduction\u201d (Remand AE B). He has earned \nsubstantial credit for his service to his country overseas for many years, especially his \ncurrent service in a combat zone.    \n \nApplicant provided sufficient evidence that he resolved all SOR debts except for \nthe debt of $8,708 in SOR \u00b6 1.e. In regard to the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e, he failed to establish \nthat he acted responsibly after he became fully employed and received the SOR.  \n \nHowever, his failure to show financial responsibility is a much lesser security \nconcern than his falsification of his SF 86, compounded by his false explanation at his \nhearing about receiving bad advice from security personnel. If his single delinquent debt \nin SOR \u00b6 1.e was the only security concern, I would mitigate all security concerns under \nthe \u201cWhole Person Concept.\u201d  \n \nApplicant deliberately failed to disclose his two felonies on his 2004 security \nclearance application. This falsification has a serious negative impact on my security \nclearance determination because it damages his integrity and trustworthiness. He claimed \nthat he disclosed his felonies to security personnel in 2004 and again to security \npersonnel at a different company in 2006. He asserted that security personnel in both \noffices told him not to list conduct prior to 2000 (his two felony convictions occurred in \n1998). His false statements about receiving this bad advice on March 20, 2008, and again \non November 18, 2008, are recent. An Applicant should not receive a clearance when \nthey provide recent, false explanations for failing to disclose information on an SF 86. His \nstatement that he disclosed the felonies to his current employer in 2006, who told him not \nto disclose the information on his 2004 SF 86 and to back date the 2004 SF 86 is not \ncredible. It is simply not plausible that two security offices for two different defense \ncontractors would tell an Applicant not to reveal information that was clearly and \nexpressly required on a security clearance application.      \n \n\n \n17 \n                                                                                                                                             \n                                           \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d12 and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, all the evidence in this decision (especially his contributions to his employer and \nhis country, while serving in a combat zone) and my interpretation of my responsibilities \nunder the Guidelines. For the reasons stated, I conclude he is not eligible for access to \nclassified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.d: \n For Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.f and 1.g: \n For Applicant \n  \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:    \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.b and 2.c: \n For Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) proposed to deny or revoke access to\nautomated information systems in ADP-I/II/III sensitivity positions for Applicant.  On August 30,\n\nThe Judge\u2019s favorable findings with respect to paragraphs 1.g, 1.i, 1.k, 1.m, 1.n, 1.o, 2.a, 2.b, and 2.c are not\n1\nat issue on appeal.  In her brief, Applicant also contends that she did not deliberately falsify two public trust positions\nquestionnaires by failing to disclose seven debts that were delinquent for over 180 days and four prior criminal charges.\nIn support of this contention, she argues that the omission of the information was due to a misinterpretation on her part,\nand she subsequently provided the correct information.  Because the Judge found in favor of Applicant under Guideline\nE, the Board need not address this issue.\n2\n2006, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2014trustworthiness concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On February 28, 2007, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge Marc E. Curry denied Applicant\u2019s request for a trustworthiness designation.\nApplicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether Applicant was denied due process;\nwhether the Judge erred by concluding that the trustworthiness concerns raised under Guideline F\nhad not been mitigated.1\n(1) On appeal, Applicant argues that at the hearing she was in tears and very nervous, and\ncould have given more verbal information pertaining to some the questions that were asked of her.\nThe  Board construes Applicant\u2019s argument as raising the issue of whether she received due process.\nAfter reviewing the record in this case, the Board concludes that Applicant was reasonably\nprovided with the procedural rights set forth in Executive Order 10865 and the Directive, and that\nthe Judge conducted the hearing in a professional manner, consistent with his role as an impartial\npresiding official.  Based upon the representations he received from the Applicant at the beginning\nof the hearing, the Judge reasonably concluded that Applicant was making a knowing and intelligent\nwaiver of her right to counsel, and was ready and willing to proceed with the hearing. See, e.g., ISCR\nCase No. 02-17574 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 24, 2006); Compare ISCR Case No. 04-12732 at 8 (App. Bd.\nNov. 2, 2006).  During the hearing Applicant gave reasonably detailed explanations with respect to\nthe matters at issue in the case, appeared to understand what was transpiring, answered questions\nappropriately, and did not otherwise impose any objections to the proceedings.\nAlthough pro se applicants cannot be expected to act like lawyers, they are expected to take\ntimely, reasonable steps to protect their rights under the Directive.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 00-0593\nat 4 (App. Bd. May 14, 2001).  If they fail to take timely, reasonable steps to protect their rights, that\nfailure to act does not constitute a denial of their rights.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-19896 at 6\n(App. Bd.

Applicant\u2019s argument\n2\ndoes not demonstrate that the Judge erred.\nThe federal government need not wait until an applicant actually mishandles or fails to\nproperly handle sensitive information before it can deny or revoke access to such information.  See,\ne.g., ADP Case No. 06-09293 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 6, 2007).  Trustworthiness determinations are not\nlimited to consideration of an applicant's job performance or conduct during duty hours, and off-duty\nconduct can be relevant in assessing an applicant's trustworthiness eligibility. See, e.g., ADP Case\nNo. 06-07581 at 2 (App. Bd. May 17, 2007).  An applicant with good or exemplary job performance\nmay engage in conduct that has negative trustworthiness implications.  See, e.g., ADP Case No. 06-\n09293 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 6, 2007).  The Directive's Guidelines set forth a variety of examples of off-\nduty conduct and circumstances which are of trustworthiness concern to the government and\nmandate a whole-person analysis to determine an applicant's trustworthiness eligibility.  A whole-\nperson analysis is not confined to the workplace.  Id.\nThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and whole-person factors does not\nturn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the particular facts of a case.  Rather, their\napplication requires the exercise of sound discretion in light of the record evidence as a whole.  See,\ne.g., ADP Case No. 06-02549 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 3, 2007).

An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the\nJudge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence,\nis not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner\nthat is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nIn this case, the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the\nlength and seriousness of her history of financial difficulties, and considered the possible application\nof relevant mitigating conditions.  He reasonably explained why the evidence which the Applicant\nhad presented in mitigation was insufficient to overcome all the government\u2019s trustworthiness\nconcerns.  The Board does not review a case de novo.  The favorable record evidence cited by\nApplicant is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary\nto law.  See, e.g., ADP Case No. 06-07581 at 2 (App. Bd. May 17, 2007).

Clearance is denied.                                                       \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn July 18, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 (as amended) and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated\nJanuary 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why\nDOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant and\nrecommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied\nor revoked.\nApplicant filed a signed and sworn, notarized response, dated September 27, 2006, to the\nallegations set forth in the SOR. He requested a clearance decision based on a hearing record before\na DOHA Administrative Judge.\nOn November 8, 2006, this case was assigned to this Administrative Judge to conduct a\nhearing and issue a written decision. A Notice of Hearing was issued to the parties on November 15,\n2006, and the hearing was held on December 6, 2006.\nAt the hearing, Department Counsel offered ten documentary exhibits (Exhibits 1 - 10) and\nno witnesses were called. Applicant offered no documentary exhibits, but did testify on his own\nbehalf. The transcript (Tr) was received on December 18,2006.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe Government opposes Applicant's request for a security clearance, based upon the\nallegations set forth in the SOR. In the SOR, the Government alleges that a security risk may exist\nunder Adjudicative Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the\nDirective. The SOR contains five allegations, 1.a. through 1.e., under Guideline G, and one\nallegation, 2.a., under Guideline E. In his Response to the SOR (RSOR) Applicant admits allegations\n1.c., 1.d., and 1.e.. He denies 1.a., 1.b., and 2.a..  The admitted allegations are incorporated as\nfindings of fact.\nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including Applicant's\nAnswer to the SOR, the admitted documents and the live testimony, and upon due consideration of\nthat evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact: \n\n3\nApplicant is 63 years old. He is married and has two children. He has a Masters Degree in\nElectrical Engineering. Applicant is an independent contractor, employed by a defense contractor,\nand he seeks to retain a DoD security clearance in connection with his employment in the defense\nsector.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline G - Alcohol consumption). \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because\nhe abuses alcohol to excess.\nApplicant's drinking has resulted in at least four alcohol related convictions for DUI. They\noccurred in 1982, 1986, and two times in 1995. \nOn April 29, 1982, Applicant was arrested and charged with two Counts; 1) Driving Under\nthe Influence of Alcohol/Drugs, and 2) BA Level over .10%.  He pled guilty to Count 1, and he was\nsentenced to three year summary probation (RSOR, Exhibit 4). \nOn January 28, 1986, Applicant was arrested and charged with two Counts; 1) Driving Under\nthe Influence of Alcohol/Drugs, and 2) BA Level over .10%.  He pled guilty to Count 1, and he was\nsentenced to three year summary probation (RSOR, Exhibit 4).\nOn February 7, 1995, Applicant was arrested and charged with two Counts; 1) Driving Under\nthe Influence of Alcohol/Drugs, and 2) BA Level over .20% or greater.  He pled No Contest, and he\nreceived 100 hours of community service (RSOR, Exhibits 3, 7, 8).\nOn December 19, 1995, Applicant was arrested and charged with three Counts; 1) Driving\nUnder the Influence of Alcohol/Drugs, 2) Driving with BA .08% or More, and (3) Driving with\nSuspended/Revoked License.  He was found guilty on all counts (Exhibit 6, 9) (Tr at 99) . Applicant\nadmitted that he was arrested and found guilty for this DUI. The Government\u2019s also alleges that a\nBench Warrant was issued on April 26, 1996, for Applicant\u2019s failure to appear, but he denies that\nthis occurred. Department Counsel offered Exhibit 9, a Booking Sheet, dated May 24, 2004, to\nestablish that a bench warrant had been issued against Applicant. I find that Exhibit 9 is not\nsufficiently clear to establish that a bench warrant was issued against Applicant for failure to appear,\nand the bench warrant allegation has not been proven.   \nOn October 19, 1989, a hearing was conducted by Directorate for Industrial Security\nClearance Review (DISCR), the Government agency that is  the predecessor to DOHA, to determine\nif Applicant should be allowed to hold a security clearance. The primary concern was Applicant\u2019s\nconsumption to excess of alcohol. The result of that hearing was that Applicant was denied a security\nclearance.\nIn a sworn statement signed on January 7, 2004, (Exhibit 3),  Applicant averred that he\n\u201cdrinks moderately at home and occasionally at restaurants.\u201d He added that he has no intention to\nmodify his personal lifestyle. Applicant also testified that he continues to drive after one or two\nalcoholic drinks, and while he does not think he would be above the legal limit, he conceded that he\nhas no way of knowing what his blood alcohol count would be, since he did not believe he was\nabove the limit, when he was found guilty of the DUIs in the past. \n\n4\nParagraph 2 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct) \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because\nhe furnished untruthful information to the Government.  Applicant completed a signed, sworn\nSecurity Clearance Application (SCA) on March 14, 2003 (Exhibit 1) . Question #24 asked whether\nApplicant was \u201cever charged with or convicted of any offense(s) related to alcohol or drugs?\u201d\nApplicant answered \"No.\" As discussed above, Applicant was charged with or convicted of four \nDUIs in the years 1982, 1986, and two times in 1995. Applicant should have listed these four DUI\nconvictions.\nApplicant contended that he did not include these incidents because he was instructed by a\nsecurity representative to only go back five years in his responses. While testifying at the hearing\nApplicant conceded that some questions on the SCA requested that the individual completing the\nSCA should refer back for the previous seven years, while other questions did not ask for a time\nlimit, but rather asked whether this question ever applied to the individual. Applicant acknowledged\nthat these question were inconsistent with the instruction he claimed to have received to only go back\nfive years for any question, and he did concede that the wording of the question did indicate that the\nGovernment wanted more than a five year history (Tr at 92). \nBased on his prior 1989 hearing, which resulted in a denial of a security clearance for alcohol\nconsumption, Applicant certainly should have been aware that the Government was concerned about\nhis alcohol consumption and would want to know about his entire alcohol conviction history. \nFinally, Applicant testified that if the record was held open, he would offer a statement from\nthe security officer verifying that he was instructed to only go back five years in all of his answers.\nWhile the record was held open, no statement was ever offered.\nClearly in this case, Applicant was not honest with the information that he furnished to the\nGovernment. His explanation that he was instructed to only refer back five years is not credible, and\nhe knew or should have known that he should have included all four DUI convictions on his 2003\nSCA.\nPOLICIES\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum. Accordingly, the Department of\nDefense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992 Directive, has set forth policy factors which must be given\n\"binding\" consideration in making security clearance determinations. These factors should be\nfollowed in every case according to the pertinent guideline. However, the factors are neither\nautomatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative\nJudge's reliance on his own common sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature and\nthe ways of the world, in making a reasoned decision. Because each security clearance case presents\nits own unique facts and circumstances, it cannot be assumed that these factors exhaust the realm\nof human experience, or apply equally in every case. \n\n5\nAs set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17, \"In evaluating the relevance of\nan individual's conduct, the [Administrative Judge] should consider the following factors [General\nFactors]:\na. The nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct\nb. The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation\nc. The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd. The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne. The voluntariness of participation\nf. The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes\ng. The motivation for the conduct\nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\ni. The likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe eligibility guidelines established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics\nand conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question of whether it is \"clearly consistent\nwith the national interest\" to grant an Applicant's request for access to classified information.\nIn the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian\nworkers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information twenty-four hours a day.\nThe Government is therefore appropriately concerned where available information indicates that an\nApplicant for clearance may be involved in acts of alcohol abuse and criminal conduct that\ndemonstrates poor judgement, untrustworthiness or unreliability on the Applicant's part.\nThe DoD Directive states, \"Each adjudication is to be an overall common sense\ndetermination based upon consideration and assessment of all available information, both favorable\nand unfavorable, with particular emphasis placed on the seriousness, recency, frequency, and\nmotivation for the individual's conduct; the extent to which conduct was negligent, willful,\nvoluntary, or undertaken with the knowledge of the circumstances or consequences involved; and,\nto the extent that it can be estimated, the probability that conduct will or will not continue in the\nfuture.\" The Administrative Judge can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have a\nreasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record. The Judge cannot draw inferences or\nconclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature. Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \"Any determination under this order...shall be\na determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the\nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\"\nCONCLUSIONS\nIt is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding\nof a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant's conduct and the continued holding of a\nsecurity clearance. If such a case has been established, the burden then shifts to the Applicant to go\nforward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome or\noutweigh the Government's case. The Applicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving\nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him or her a security clearance.\n\n6\n(Guideline G - Alcohol Consumption) \nIn this case, the Government has met its initial burden of proving by substantial evidence that\nApplicant has used alcohol to excess (Guideline G). Applicant has not introduced persuasive\nevidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome the Government's\ncase against him.\nApplicant has had a long history of consuming alcohol, at times to excess, which has caused\nhim four DUI convictions. While there have been no DUI arrests since 1995, Applicant continues\nto regularly drive a vehicle after consuming alcohol in the same quantity as he did during his prior\nDUI arrests and convictions. \nThe Government has established that Applicant was involved in alcohol-related incidents\naway from work, which is Disqualifying Condition (DC) (E2.A7.1.2.1.), and that he has engaged in\nhabitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment, DC (E2.A7.1.2.5.). \nIn reviewing the Mitigating Conditions (MC), it could be argued that MC (E2.A7.1.3.2.)\napplies because Applicant\u2019s last DUI conviction occurred in 1995. However, since Applicant\ncontinues to drive after consuming alcohol in the amounts that resulted in his DUI convictions, the\nunderlying conduct, that is of concern, has not abated.  Overall, the disqualifying conditions\noutweigh the mitigating conditions, and Guideline G is concluded against Applicant.\n(Guideline E -Personal Conduct) \nWith respect to Guideline E, the evidence establishes that Applicant furnished to the\nGovernment less than a complete, honest answer by failing to list any of his four DUI convictions,\nin a 2003 SCA.  \nThe Government relies heavily on the honesty and integrity of individuals seeking access to\nour nation\u2019s secrets. When such an individual intentionally falsifies material facts or fails to furnish\nrelevant information to a Government investigator, it is extremely difficult to conclude that he\nnevertheless possesses the judgment, and honesty necessary for an individual given a clearance. In\nthis case, I do not find Applicant\u2019s explanation for his failure to inform the Government about his\nfour DUIs credible or reasonable. I conclude that Applicant knowingly and willingly failed to give\ncomplete, honest information to the Government.\nIn reviewing the DCs under Guideline E,  I conclude that DC (E2.A5.1.2.2.) applies because\nApplicant was not candid and truthful in information that he provided to the Government in the\nSCA. Applicant\u2019s conduct, considered as a whole, including his alcohol consumption and his\ndishonesty exhibits questionable judgement, unreliability, and a lack of candor. I resolve Paragraph\n2, Guideline E against Applicant\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nParagraph 1. Guideline G: AGAINST APPLICANT\n\n7\nSubparagraph 1.a.: Against Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.b.: Against Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.c.: Against Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.d.: Against Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.e.: Against Applicant.\nParagraph 2. Guideline E: AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a.: Against Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.\nMartin H.

Edmunds, Esq. \nSYNOPSIS\n\n2\nApplicant, a 60-year-old engineer who has held a security clearance for 40 years and who has\nworked for several defense contractors, mitigated security concerns arising from his termination from\nhis former employment for misuse of a company credit card while purchasing tools and other\nequipment for installation kits for use by teams of his engineering staff. His explanation and rationale\nfor his actions was sufficient to explain and provide a correct analysis of the concerns expressed in\na human resources staff report that led to his termination. Clearance is granted. \nSTATEMENT OF CASE\nOn June 27, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, as amended and\nmodified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the\npreliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. DOHA recommended the case be\nreferred to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued,\ndenied, or revoked.\nOn July 12, 2006, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and requested a hearing. The\nmatter was assigned to another judge on October 13, 2006, and re-assigned to me on January 9, 2007.\nA notice of hearing was issued on January 24, 2007, for a hearing on February 27, 2007, and held\nthat day. The government offered four exhibits and Applicant offered 16 at the hearing. All were\nadmitted into evidence. The record was left open for 30 days and on February 28, 2007, Applicant\nsubmitted one additional exhibit that was admitted in evidence without objection. One witness\ntestified for the government. Applicant and four witness testified on behalf of Applicant. The\ntranscript was received on March 9, 2007. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted the specific facts of the two SOR allegations but provided explanatory\ninformation. After a complete review of the record, I make the following findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 60-year-old employee of a major defense contractor who worked as a lead\nengineer from 1990 until 2004. He was suspended without pay on April 22, 2004, and terminated\non April 30, 2004, after an investigation by the company of misuse of a corporate credit card\nresulting in a report to the \u201cfile\u201d dated April 26, 2004 (Exh. 2 pages 5-7). He had been promoted one\nmonth earlier to an annual salary of $105,000. He did not contest the termination as he was advised\nby his then counsel that as an \u201cat will\u201d employee he had no rights. \nSince his discharge he has worked for two other major defense contractors as an engineer.\nHe was hired at the first company a year after his termination in April 2005 at the same salary as he\nhad at the first company. When he left the second company in September 2006 when the contract\n\n3\nhe worked on was completed, he had been proposed for a $3,000 per annum raise and was rated as\nan excellent employee with a long list of accomplishments. He has worked for his present employer\nfor less than a year. He served on active duty in the Navy for 22 years and retired as a Lt.\nCommander. He has held a clearance for over 40 years with no security violations. He holds a B.S.\nand Masters degree in electrical engineering and graduated summa cum laude. \nThe allegations in the SOR center around Applicant\u2019s misuse of a company credit card, his\ndischarge from employment, and his statements to the investigator from the Office of Personnel\nManagement (OPM) for this proceeding. Applicant\u2019s work for his former employer concerned\nproviding engineering installation services with a team of several staff members on Navy ships. The\ninstallers were required by the company to provide their own tools for their work. Applicant and\nothers objected to this on the basis that their tools were getting stolen and broken. In 2003 the policy\nwas changed and the company agreed to provide the tools to the employees. His job assignment at\nthat time was assistant program manager and materiel procurer (Tr. 103). Applicant was directed to\nassemble tools for three large tool boxes each of them for installation teams of one to five persons\nwho would use them on assignments. The tools would not be used in the shops or the labs so that\nthey would be fully stocked and ready for use by the teams on installation assignments (Tr. 114). He\nbought these items commercially using a corporate credit card (P card) he was authorized to use\nexcept for personal items and travel. Usually the purchases were made on weekends when he was\ntraveling on company business. \nThe other option available to him and preferred by his company was to acquire them through\nthe on-line procurement system of the company (Ariba) but it was inflexible and time consuming\nso often not used by other managers in similar situations (Tr. 60-63). The system was discontinued\nby the company soon after this investigation concluded (Tr. 85-88). In addition to the tools for his\nteam, he occasionally bought items for other employees for corporate use when those employees did\nnot have a P card and needed items sooner than the on-line system could provide. \nSome of the tools were specific to the work Applicant and his teams were performing such\nas hard hats, wiring, and label-making equipment for mil spec identification. Many others used for\ncompany work were not unique to it such as screwdrivers hammers and pliers. Others were items\nthat someone might find strange but had specific applicability to his team assignments such as:\n1. Steel toed shoes: Required for use on one installation (Post hearing submission Exh. Q.\n2. Golf shirts with company logo: Used by teams while aboard ship. \n3. Garden hose 50 foot: Purchased for staff member and remained in company office unused.\n4. Antennas for walkie talkies: For communication aboard ship when cell phones inoperable.\n5. Travel guides to Canada: Purchased in anticipation of staff assignments in Canada. \n6. Static guard carpet cleaner: Used to eliminate static at workplace aboard ships. \nThe company investigation of Applicant was done by a generalist in the human resources\ndivision (Exh. 2, p. 4) who was not familiar with the products purchased but interviewed others in\nthe company over several days. These were discussed in her three-page report dated April 26, 2004.\nTwo of these were supervisors of Applicant (page 3) who did not question the items purchased for\n\n4\nthis \u201cextremely fast turnaround program\u201d but did question some the quantities of some items\npurchased in that they might have, in their opinion, exceeded requirements for the program. The\ncompany investigator was concerned that Applicant did not use Ariba, as was one of the supervisors.\nApplicant asserted during the company investigation and to the OPM investigator, who\ntestified as a government witness at the hearing, that he purchased only for government use and that\nall the products bought remained with the company. The one exception was a mistaken purchase of\nan impact wrench that was for his personal use and he reimbursed the company for it (Exh. P). With\nthat one exception all other items he purchased were the property of the company and, as such,\nremain in the possession of the company. \nIn his statement to the OPM investigator (Exh. 3), Applicant gave a detailed analysis of the\nitems purchased, why they were purchased and in what volume. He continued to assert that he did\nnot misuse the credit card and that all the purchases were for the benefit of the company and his team\nof engineers. The investigator found the Applicant in his interview to be candid and straightforward\n(Tr. 31-32). He did not independently investigate specific allegations as that was not his assignment.\nHowever, he was sufficiently concerned with the allegations that he sought the investigative files\nfrom the company but was unable to get them. He was told by the company investigator that they\nwere not available since they were either in storage or had been lost (Tr. 47-53). Thus, he was unable\nto check the statements made in the company report against statements made to the investigator. \nApplicant was well regarded by his former company based on his performance evaluations\n(Exhs. K-N). In addition to the four witnesses who testified for him and also submitted statements\non his behalf, five others submitted statements (Exhs. A-I). All spoke and wrote of his reputation for\nhonesty and integrity as well as his work performance skills. One described his attention to detail\nand \u201ccan do\u201d attitude (Exh. E). Another described him as one of the most capable systems engineers\nhe had ever known. He had an excellent reputation at his last employer and was considered one of\ntheir best engineers (Tr. 77-80). He has worked too brief a period for his present employer to be\nevaluated but they support his effort to obtain a security clearance.\nApplicant has been married for 29 years and has three grown children. His principal activity\noutside of work and family is helping with off road racing competitions. \nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position that will give that person access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527.\nAn evaluation of whether the applicant meets the security guidelines includes consideration\nof the following factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and\nmaturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence\nof rehabilitation and other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential\nfor pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\n\n5\nDirective, \u00b6 E2.2.1. Security clearances are granted only when \u201cit is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to do so.\u201d Executive Order No. 10865 \u00a7 2. See Executive Order No. 12968 \u00a7 3.1(b).\nInitially, the government must establish, by something less than a preponderance of the\nevidence, that conditions exist in the personal or professional history of the applicant which\ndisqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information\nSee Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. The applicant then bears the burden of demonstrating it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance. \u201cAny doubt as to\nwhether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved\nin favor of the national security.\u201d Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.2. \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should\nerr, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. See Executive Order No. 12968 \u00a7\n3.1(b).\nCONCLUSIONS\nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate\nadjudicative factors, I conclude the following with respect to all allegations set forth in the SOR:\nApplicant\u2019s discharge from his employer of 14 years and the reasons assigned to the\ntermination prompted the allegations of security concerns under Guideline E (Personal Conduct).\nIt is also alleged that his continued denial of the allegations to the OPM investigator was a\nfalsification of material facts. Such conduct might indicate questionable judgment, unreliability, and\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations and could indicate that the person may not\nproperly safeguard classified information (E2.A5.1.1.). Specifically, the deliberate omission,\nconcealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts in a personnel security interview could\nraise a security concern and be disqualifying. (E2.A5.1.2.2.)\nAfter analyzing testimony of Applicant, his witnesses, the OPM investigator, the\ninvestigative report which was the basis on which the company terminated him, and the statement\nApplicant gave to the OPM investigator, I find that the conclusion of the company investigator was\nunfounded and unsubstantiated. While the practices followed by Applicant might not have been in\nstrict keeping with the preferred company purchasing practices then in effect, he had a rational\nexplanation for all of the issues the company investigator evaluated. The report of the OPM\ninvestigator provided a thorough analysis of Applicant\u2019s actions and rationale for them. The\nunavailability of a complete file impeded Applicant and the OPM investigator. I find the available\nevidence does not raise a potentially disqualifying condition under Guideline E. \nGuideline J (Criminal Conduct) is alleged on the basis that the statement to the OPM\ninvestigator was false and is a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a71001. I conclude that the evidence does not\nsupport the allegation since the statement was not false.\nIn all adjudications the protection of our national security is of paramount concern. Persons\nwho have access to classified information have an overriding responsibility for the security concerns\nof the nation. The objective of the security clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense\nassessment of a person\u2019s trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information. \n\n6\nThe \u201cwhole person\u201d concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of their acts\nand omissions. Each case must be judged on its own merits taking into consideration all relevant\ncircumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis. Applicant has\nhad a successful career both in the Navy and in industry. He had 22 years of active duty and is now\nretired from the Navy. He has successfully held a security clearance for 40 years. There is nothing\nin his background or the facts of this matter to suggest that he is vulnerable to pressures which might\nraise a security concern. Even if he did not strictly follow the preferred acquisition process, the\nnature and seriousness of the conduct is not sufficient to justify the loss of his clearance. Applying\nthe precepts of the whole person analysis, I conclude that Applicant meets the security guidelines.\nAfter considering all the evidence in its totality, including the whole person of Applicant, I\nconclude a security clearance should be granted.\nFORMAL FINDINGS \nFormal findings as required by the Directive (Par. E3.1.25) are as follows:\nParagraph 1. Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2.

Leonard denied Applicant\u2019s request for a trustworthiness designation.  Applicant\ntimely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge erred by concluding the\ntrustworthiness concerns under Guideline F had not been mitigated.\nApplicant argues that the Judge erred in concluding that the trustworthiness concerns raised\nby her history of financial difficulties had not been mitigated, because her indebtedness was due to\nseparation, divorce, and the loss of a family member, and she is current on her recent debts and has\nno history of deceptive or illegal financial practices.  Applicant\u2019s argument does not demonstrate that\nthe Judge erred\nThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and whole person factors does not\nturn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the particular facts of a case.  Rather, their\napplication requires the exercise of sound discretion in light of the record evidence as a whole.  See,\ne.g., ADP Case No. 05-03939 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 1, 2006).  Thus, the presence of some mitigating\nevidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable trustworthiness determination.  As\nthe trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable\nevidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the\nJudge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence,\nis not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner\nthat is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nApplicant requested that her case be decided upon the written record, and then did not\nrespond to the government\u2019s file of relevant material.  As a result, the Judge noted that \u201c. . . the\navailable information in support of Applicant is limited.\u201d   The Judge weighed the mitigating\n1\nevidence offered by Applicant against the seriousness of the disqualifying conduct, and considered\nthe possible application of relevant mitigating factors.  He reasonably explained why the evidence\nwhich the Applicant had presented in mitigation was insufficient to overcome the government\u2019s\ntrustworthiness concerns.  The favorable record evidence cited by Applicant is not sufficient to\ndemonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ADP Case No.\n03-14873 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 28, 2006).  The Board does not review a case de novo.   Given the\nrecord that was before him, the Judge\u2019s ultimate unfavorable trustworthiness determination is\nsustainable.  Thus, the Administrative Judge did not err in denying Applicant access to automated\ninformation systems in ADP-I/II/III sensitivity positions.\n\n3\nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge denying Applicant access to automated information systems in\nADP-I/II/III sensitivity positions is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Jean E.

LEONARD\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nJames F. Duffy, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nJoseph L. Johnson, Esq.\nSYNOPSIS\n\n Executive Order 10865, dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive 5220.6, dated January 2,\n1\n1992, as amended (Directive).\n See Memorandum from the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, dated August 30, 2006, Subject:\n2\nImplementation of Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (December\n29, 2005). \n2\nApplicant has a history of financial problems consisting of delinquent consumer debts and\na real estate foreclosure. He has not presented sufficient information to explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate the financial considerations security concern. Clearance is denied. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny or revoke his eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order and DoD Directive,  the Defense\n1\nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant on\nNovember 21, 2006. The SOR\u2014which is equivalent to an administrative complaint\u2014details the\nfactual basis for the action and alleges security concerns under Guideline F for financial\nconsiderations. Applicant, through counsel, timely replied to the SOR and requested a hearing. \nIn addition to the Directive, this case is brought under the revised Adjudicative Guidelines\nfor Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information approved by the President on\nDecember 29, 2005. The revised guidelines were then modified by the Defense Department, effective\nSeptember 1, 2006. They supersede or replace the guidelines published in Enclosure 2 to the\nDirective and Appendix 8 to DoD Regulation 5200.2-R, and they apply to all adjudications and other\ndeterminations where an SOR has been issued on September 1, 2006, or thereafter.  Both the\n2\nDirective and the Regulation are pending formal amendment. The revised guidelines apply to this\ncase because the SOR is dated November 21, 2006. At the hearing, Applicant acknowledged that\nthey would apply to his case (R. 129\u2013130). \nThe case was assigned to me January 24, 2007. A notice of hearing was issued scheduling\nthe hearing for March 5, 2007. The hearing took place as scheduled. DOHA received the hearing\ntranscript March 14, 2007.\nRULINGS ON PROCEDURE\nThe government moved to amend the SOR by adding three additional allegations of\nindebtedness to the Guideline F allegation (Appellate Exhibit I). Without objections, the motion was\ngranted and subparagraphs 1.f, 1.g, and 1.h were added (R. 11\u201313).  \n\n3\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant\u2019s response to the SOR allegations was mixed. His admissions and explanations\nare incorporated herein. I make the following findings of fact set forth below in numbered\nparagraphs. \n1.\nApplicant is a 52-year-old driver for a trucking company engaged in hauling munitions and\nother loads for the government. He has been married and divorced four times. He is part of a two-\nperson driving team who operates a company-owned truck. The other driver is a woman he has had\na romantic relationship with for the last five years. He has worked for his current employer since\nFebruary 2002, and held an interim security clearance until the SOR was issued in November 2006.\nSince the loss of his interim security clearance, Applicant has continued to work hauling non-\nrestricted government freight.\n2.\nApplicant has a history of financial problems. As part of the background investigation, a\ncredit report was obtained in January 2005 (Exhibit 2). The public record section of the report\nrevealed a state tax lien for $1,591 filed in June 1997 and paid in August 1998. The trade section of\nthe report revealed nine accounts of which only three accounts did not have a negative account\nhistory. The collections section of the report revealed an unpaid collection account. An additional\ncredit report was obtained in November 2006, and this report further revealed or confirmed\nApplicant\u2019s unfavorable financial history. The specific accounts alleged in the SOR, as amended,\nare discussed below.\n3.\nSOR subparagraph 1.a concerns a collection account for $78. Applicant disputes this debt\nbecause he had previously paid this account in full. He presented documentary proof from the\ncollection agency that the account was turned over to their office in error (Exhibit A).\n4.\nSOR subparagraph 1.b concerns a collection account for $157. It stemmed from a medical\nbill for services incurred without health insurance. Applicant resolved this account by payment in\nfull in December 2006 (Exhibit B).\n5.\nSOR subparagraph 1.c concerns a past-due collection account for $3,481. It originated as a\ncredit card account during Applicant\u2019s fourth marriage. Applicant says the account was allocated to\nhim during the divorce proceedings. He has made $100 monthly payments for the last three months.\nApplicant did not present any documentary evidence on this debt.\n6.\nSOR subparagraph 1.d concerns a collection account for $224. The account originated as an\naccount for TV services, and it was placed for collection when it became delinquent. Applicant\nresolved this account by payment in full in December 2006 (Exhibit C).\n7.\nSOR subparagraph 1.e concerns a collection account for $7,903. It appears the account\noriginated as an auto loan with payment terms of $388 monthly (Exhibit 2 at 2). It became a bad debt\nand was placed for collection with the creditor alleged in the SOR (Exhibit 3 at 2). Applicant has\nbeen unable to find any information on this account and did not present any documentary evidence\non this debt.\n\n4\n8.\nSOR subparagraph 1.f concerns a real estate mortgage for $60,000 that went into foreclosure\nin about November 2000. Applicant explained that the debt stemmed from the home where he and\nhis fourth wife lived. He says the house was sold and there was not a deficiency balance (R. 49\u201351).\nHis assertion is verified by the most recent credit report that shows a zero balance (Exhibit 3 at 2).\n9.\nSOR subparagraph 1.g concerns a charged-off account for $2,531. Applicant believes this\ndebt is the same as that alleged in subparagraph 1.c. The 2005 credit report shows this was a credit\ncard account that became a bad debt and was placed for collection (Exhibit 2 at 2). The account was\nsold or transferred, and it shows a zero balance on the account with a high credit of $2,531. The debt\nappears again on the credit report as a collection account 120 days or more past due with a balance\nof $3,481 and a high credit of $2,531 (Exhibit 2 at 3). Applicant did not present any documentary\nevidence on this debt. Reading the two entries in the credit report together and given the high credit\namounts match, I find the debt in subparagraphs 1.c and 1.g are the same, and Applicant owes\napproximately $3,481 on this debt.\n10.\nSOR subparagraph 1.h concerns a collection account for $11,358. Applicant thought this debt\nwas the same as that alleged in subparagraph 1.e, but he did not present any documentary evidence\non this debt. Under cross-examination, he acknowledged that it was possible this debt stemmed from\na car loan that he cosigned for a girlfriend several years ago (R. 69\u201373). Moreover, the two credit\nreports establish two different accounts. The 2005 credit report shows this debt originated as a car\nloan with $309 monthly payments (Exhibit 2 at 3). It became a bad debt and was placed for\ncollection by transfer or sale to another creditor. The report reflects a zero balance and a high credit\nof $11,358. The 2006 credit report shows another creditor holding the account with a zero balance\nand a high credit of $11,358 (Exhibit 3 at 2). The debt was also transferred or sold. At bottom, both\ncredit reports establish that Applicant was delinquent on this account in the past and that it is a\ndifferent debt than that alleged in subparagraph 1.e. \n11.\nIn addition to the debts in the SOR, Applicant is making monthly payments to a creditor for\na $9,000 medical bill he incurred when he was hospitalized for several days without health\ninsurance. He has made monthly payments on this account for the last two years or so, and, as far\nas he knows, the account is in good standing.\n12.\nApplicant concedes that he is not a good money manager. His girlfriend/co-driver handles\nall the money matters, bill paying, etc., via a joint account. Because they are on the road for weeks\nat a time, they do not own or rent a residence. Instead, they live with his girlfriend\u2019s parents and\nassist with living expenses. Applicant does not have a personal credit card. Applicant attributes his\nfinancial problems to his last divorce in about 2000 after a brief one-year marriage and the medical\nexpenses he incurred without health insurance in about 2004.  \n13.\nApplicant has not been arrested, charged, or convicted or any crimes. Likewise, he has not\nhad a speeding ticket for five years.\nPOLICIES\nThe Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a person\u2019s\nsecurity clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions\n\n Directive, Enclosure 2, \u00b6 E2.2.1 (setting forth nine factors to consider under the whole-person concept).\n3\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n4\n ISCR Case No. 96-0277 (App. Bd.

Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a\n10\nsecurity clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10  Cir. 2002) (\u201cIt is likewise plain that there\nth\nis no \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance, so that full-scale due process standards do not apply to cases such as Duane\u2019s.\u201d).\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.\n11\n5\n(MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial\ncommonsense decision based upon consideration of all the relevant and material information, the\npertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-person concept.  A person granted access\n3\nto classified information enters into a special relationship with the government. The government\nmust be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in those persons to whom it grants access\nto classified information. The decision to deny a person a security clearance is not a determination\nof an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination that the applicant has not met the strict\n4\nguidelines the President has established for granting eligibility for a security clearance.\nBURDEN OF PROOF\nThe only purpose of a security-clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an applicant.  There is no\n5\npresumption in favor of granting or continuing access to classified information.  The government\n6\nhas the burden of presenting evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been\ncontroverted.  An applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or\n7\nmitigate facts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate burden\n8\nof persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.9\nNo one has a right to a security clearance.  As noted by the Supreme Court in Department\n10\nof Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations\nshould err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the\n11\nDirective, any doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information\nwill be resolved in favor of protecting national security.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n6\nUnder Guideline F, a concern typically exists due to significant unpaid debts. Failure or\ninability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor\nself-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can\nraise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified\ninformation. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal\nor unethical acts to generate funds to meet financial obligations. Similarly, an individual who is\nfinancially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly\nhandling and safeguarding classified information.   \nHere, based on the record evidence as a whole, a security concern is raised by significant\nunpaid debts. Applicant has a well-established history of financial problems (Exhibits 2 and 3). His\nderogatory financial history is a security concern because it indicates an inability or unwillingness\nto satisfy debts and a history of not meeting financial obligations within the meaning of the\nguideline.\nI reviewed the MC under the guideline and conclude he receives some credit in mitigation.\nEach MC is briefly summarized and discussed below.\nThe first MC\u2014the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur\u2014does not apply. His financial problems are ongoing, and\nhis financial problems involve multiple delinquent debts. Given his longstanding financial problems\nthat continue to date, it is too soon to say that his financial problems are unlikely to recur. \nThe second MC\u2014the conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the\nperson\u2019s control\u2014applies somewhat. Applicant experienced understandable financial problems\nstemming from his last divorce in about 2000. Likewise, his uninsured medical expenses in about\n2004 no doubt had a negative effect on his overall financial situation and he has acted reasonably\nby making monthly payments on this debt. The credit is limited, however, given that his divorce was\nseveral years ago and he is still in the process of cleaning up his financial  house. \nThe third MC\u2014the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or\nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control\u2014does not apply. \nThere is no evidence to support application of this MC. \nThe fourth MC\u2014the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts\u2014applies somewhat. Applicant has resolved three collection accounts by\npayment in full (subparagraphs 1.a, 1.b, and 1.d). He is making monthly payments on another bad\ndebt (subparagraph 1.c). And he is making monthly payments on a sizeable medical bill not alleged\nin the SOR. Taken together, these circumstances are sufficient to qualify for initiating a good-faith\neffort within the meaning of the guideline. The credit is limited because of the other debts where he\nhas taken little, if any, action to resolve. \nThe fifth MC\u2014the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due\ndebt\u2014is not applicable here. \nThe sixth MC\u2014the affluence resulted from a legal source\u2014is not applicable here.\n\n7\nI have also considered this case in light of the whole-person concept. Applicant is 52 years\nold and sufficiently mature to make thoughtful, prudent decisions about his finances, but the record\nevidence shows otherwise. Although he has made some progress in resolving his bad debts, there\nis still much work to do. He owes about $3,481 stemming from a credit card account and he just\nstarted making monthly payments on it (subparagraphs 1.c and 1.g). He owes nearly $8,000 on a\ncollection account stemming from an auto loan (subparagraph 1.e). Also, the current status of the\nauto loan that went in collection for about $11,358 is unknown (subparagraph 1.h). \nOf concern here is the lack of documentary evidence (account statements, receipts,\ncorrespondence verifying the status of accounts, etc.) from Applicant. Other than the three small\ndebts he paid in full for less than $500 in total (Exhibits A, B, and C), he did not present\ndocumentary evidence about his other debts or his overall financial situation. Indeed, what\u2019s missing\nhere is: (1) a comprehensive, realistic approach or plan for resolving his indebtedness; (2)\ndocumented actions taken in furtherance of that approach; and (3) a measurable improvement to his\nsituation. In my view, Applicant does not have a firm grasp on his finances and it is likely his\nfinancial problems will continue. These circumstances militate against a favorable decision for\nApplicant.  \nAfter weighing the favorable and unfavorable evidence, I conclude that Applicant has not\npresented sufficient information to explain, extenuate, or mitigate the financial considerations\nsecurity concern. Likewise, he has not met his ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable\nclearance decision. \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nHere are my conclusions for each allegation in the SOR:\nSOR \u00b6 1\u2013Guideline F:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs a\u2013h:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the facts and circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

On October 3, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing the\ntrustworthiness concerns under Guidelines J, H, and E.. The action was taken under\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February\n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended\n(Directive); Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security\nProgram, dated Jan. 1987, as amended (Regulation), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on October 27, 2007.  He answered\nthe SOR in writing in an undated Answer, and requested a hearing before an\nadministrative judge. DOHA received the request on November 13, 2007. Department\nCounsel was prepared to proceed on December 18, 2007.  The case was assigned\noriginally to another administrative judge on December 27, 2007.  Because of case load\nApril 28, 2008\n\n2\nrequirements, the case was transferred to me on January 4, 2008.  DOHA issued a\nNotice of Hearing on January 25, 2008.  An Amended Notice of Hearing was issued on\nJanuary 31, 2008, because of a change in hearing location.  I convened the hearing as\nscheduled on February 12, 2008.  The Government offered Exhibits (Ex.) 1 through 4,\nwhich were received without objection.  Applicant did not submit any exhibits.  I let the\nrecord remain open until February 26, 2008, to allow Applicant to submit an alcohol\nevaluation form, but I never received any documents from Applicant after the hearing\n(Tr. 78).  DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on February 22, 2008.  The\nrecord closed on February 26, 2008.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings,\nexhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to sensitive information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all factual allegations in  the SOR,\nexcept the allegation in \u00b6 3.a. He also provided additional information to support his\nrequest for eligibility for a public trust position.  \nApplicant is 27 years old, unmarried, and works for a defense contractor in the\nhealth insurance business.  He started with this employer five years and five months\nago.  He has been promoted several times.  He works in the scheduling and processing\narea of the business.  He has two and a half years of college.  His income is $45,000\nand he owns his home. (Tr. 19, 39, 53-58; Exhibits 1, 2)\nApplicant was arrested and given a citation to appear in court on May 8, 1998,\nwhen he was at a friend\u2019s house for a party.  The citation was for trespassing and entry\nof a vehicle on the property of another person.  Applicant pled not guilty, and eventually\nthe charges were dismissed. (Tr. 21, 22; Exhibit 3)\nApplicant was arrested on July 2, 1999, and charged with underage possession\nof alcohol.  The police ticketed Applicant, but he cannot remember the details of the\nincident or the disposition of the offense. (Tr. 22; Exhibit 3)\nApplicant was arrested on August 5, 1999, on charges of underage drinking,\npossession of alcohol (first offense), and adult failure to prevent underage drinking.  He\nwas convicted of underage drinking and possession of alcohol. His fine was\napproximately $209.  The adult failure charge was dismissed.  This incident occurred at\nhis parent\u2019s lake house where he invited friends to visit him. (Tr. 23, 24; Exhibit 3)\nOn or about November 2000, Applicant was again arrested on two counts of\noperating a motor vehicle while intoxicated (OWI).  He was convicted of one count of\nOWI.  His sentence was one year probation, 30 days in jail, and a fine of $453.  His\ndriver\u2019s license was suspended for one year.  He obtained a restricted driving permit for\nwork purposes.  The other OWI charge was dismissed.  Applicant attended a friend\u2019s\nwedding, drank too much alcohol, and drove home.  He blew .17% on his breathalyser\ntest.  The terms of his probation included periodic reports to his probation officer, drug\neducation classes, and alcohol treatment classes.  At that time Applicant was 19 years\nold.  He is not certain why he was arrested on two counts of OWI. (Tr. 24-26; Exhibit 3)\n\n3\nOn or about September 2002, Applicant was arrested for identification card\nviolations and underage drinking.  He was convicted and fined $674.  Applicant had a\nfake identification card.  He tried to enter a bar with the identification card, and he was\nnot 21 years of age.  The police were called and Applicant was arrested. (Tr. 26; Exhibit\n3)\nApplicant was charged with disorderly conduct on October 26, 2003.  He was\nlater convicted of this offense and fined $160.  He does not remember much of the\ncircumstances of this offense because he was drunk.  He does remember playing darts\nin a bar. Applicant committed this offense while working for his current government\ncontractor employer. (Tr. 26, 27, 39; Exhibit 3)\nOn November 16, 2003, Applicant was arrested on charges of two counts\nresisting arrest and obstructing an officer, possession of drug paraphernalia, and\nunlawful deposit of human waste.  Applicant was traveling from bar to bar this night,\ndrinking, and could find a bathroom at 1:00 a.m. in the morning.  He urinated by a\ndumpster.  A bar security officer saw him, told him to stop and come over to him.  The\nsecurity officer apprehended him, but Applicant did not think the security officer was a\nreal policeman, so they got into a fight, ending when the security officer wrestled\nApplicant to the ground.  Applicant admitted he had the drug paraphernalia and was\nurinating publicly, but did not think the resisting arrest charge was valid.  Applicant also\ndid not want to hire a lawyer to represent him.  He did not appear in court on the\nappointed day, and an arrest warrant was issued for him.  The police found him when\nhe had an automobile accident on August 25, 2004.  The police checked their computer\nrecords for outstanding warrants, and found Applicant had one.  He later appeared in\ncourt, was convicted of the offense of unlawful deposit of human waste, ordered to\ncomplete the first offender\u2019s program, which included drug and alcohol counseling, 60\nhours of community service. He was fined $243.  The other charges were dropped by\nthe court.  The alcohol counseling included a 30-day outpatient program for four hours\na week day.  Applicant completed the program.  Applicant worked for his current\nemployer when this incident occurred. (Tr. 27-31, 39; Exhibits 3, 4)\nOn December 20, 2003, Applicant was arrested on charges of possession of\nmarijuana and reckless driving, endangering safety, and operating while intoxicated.\nHe was convicted of these offenses and fined $507.  His driving privileges were\nsuspended for one year.  Applicant had a .09% result on his breathalyser test.\nApplicant claims this arrest (alleged in Subparagraph 1.h of the SOR) is the same\noffense as alleged in the Subparagraph 1.I of the SOR.  Applicant worked for his\ncurrent employer when this incident occurred. (Tr. 31-33, 39; Exhibits 3, 4)\nOn April 20, 2004, Applicant was arrested for possession of marijuana, reckless\ndriving, and driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI).  He was convicted of reckless\ndriving and fined $151.  The other charges were dropped by the court. Applicant worked\nfor his current employer when this incident occurred. (Tr. 31-33, 39; Exhibit 3)\nApplicant was arrested on May 4, 2004, for operating a motor vehicle after his\ndriver\u2019s license was suspended.  He was convicted of this offense and fined $181.\n\n4\nApplicant does not remember why the police stopped his vehicle that night.  He also\ndoes not remember whether his driver\u2019s license was suspended for a longer period of\ntime because of this offense.  Applicant worked for his current employer when this\nincident occurred. (Tr. 33, 34, 39; Exhibit 3)\nApplicant was arrested on November 17, 2006.  The charges against him were\npossession of marijuana and drug paraphernalia.  He was convicted of these offenses,\nfined an unknown amount, and had his driver\u2019s license suspended for another six\nmonths.   Applicant was at a casino in his home state when this incident occurred.  He\nput his coat in one place, and went to another place.  The casino security officer\nthought the coat was abandoned, so they searched it to find identification to be able to\nreturn it to its owner. During that search they found the marijuana and drug\nparaphernalia.  He admitted the coat was his, and was arrested.  The marijuana in the\ncoat was about one gram, according to Applicant. This incident occurred while\nApplicant worked for his current employer. (Tr. 34, 35, 39; Exhibit 3)\nApplicant started using marijuana when he was 16 years old and in high school.\nHe used it once or twice a month at that time when he was with other students at\nparties.  He guesses he last used marijuana in November 2007, at the age of 26.  He\ndoes not remember the circumstances of that last use.  He claims he stopped using it\nbecause he does not like it anymore.  He stopped using marijuana about two years ago,\nand was going to Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings.  The older members there\ntalked about God and Applicant had an \u201cepiphany\u201d at one meeting, concluding God\nwanted humans to be happy, and marijuana use made him happy, so he quit going to\nAA meetings and started using marijuana again.  He did not like AA meetings because\nhe felt he did not fit into the demographic mix of the membership.  Applicant was\nyounger than they were.  He also saw the members smoking tobacco and drinking\ncoffee, and thought there were \u201cuppers and downers\u201d in those substances also.\nApplicant did not  submit a urine screen for drug use to verify his recollection that he\nstopped using marijuana. (Tr. 36-39, 60)\nApplicant resumed  drinking alcohol at the same time he started using marijuana\nagain.  He has no intent to stop drinking alcohol, particularly because he is now over 21\nyears of age. (Tr. 38, 39, 60, 68)\nApplicant was in drug and alcohol counseling from November 9, 2004 to\nDecember 9, 2004.  This counseling was court-ordered, apparently resulting from his\nNovember 2003, December 2003, and April 2004, arrests.  Applicant admitted that the\ncounselor assessed him to be an alcoholic, but he does not have a copy of that\nassessment.   He was in additional counseling from December 17, 2004, to February\n18, 2005.  The counselor in that program also concluded Applicant had an alcohol\nproblem.  Since then, Applicant has not had any counseling or treatment for his alcohol\nor drug problem.  Applicant was given until February 26, 2008, to submit the alcohol\nassessment from those sessions, but did not send it. (Tr. 61-66, 78)\nApplicant disclosed on his Interrogatories and during the hearing that he is\ncurrently under the care of a psychiatrist for schizophrenia.  He takes two medications\n\n5\nto help control his mental condition.  He started treatment after being involuntarily\ncommitted by his mother.  Applicant was in a hospital for a two week period, and then\nlater for a one  week period.  He has been under the care of the psychiatrist for a year\nand a half since the original committment.  His condition has not affected his work.  This\nevent was not alleged in the SOR. (Tr. 66-76; Exhibit 3)\nApplicant signed his SF 85P, on May 20, 2003. On that SF 85P he listed, in\nresponse to Question 20 (Police Record), that he was arrested for DUI in 2000, and\nunderage drinking and false identification offense in 2002.  Applicant did not list other\noffense occurring in the past seven years, as required by Question 20.  Those offenses\nwere the 1998, July 1999 and August 1999 incidents.  Applicant claims any omissions\nin response to that question were unintentional.  He used the available two lines on the\nform to list two offenses.  The same SF-85P was signed again on April 26, 2005, and\nhas attached to it a \u201cForm 85P Continuation Sheet\u201d with Applicant\u2019s initials on it and\nsigned May 4, 2005.  The Continuation Sheet contains offenses from March 31, 2003,\nto August 25, 2004. He does not recall the circumstances surrounding the signing of\nthis document.  The Continuation Sheet contains a March 31, 2003, speeding arrest not\nalleged in the SOR.  It also contains the August 25, 2004, date for offenses of resisting\nand obstructing an officer, and possession of drug paraphernalia, which in the SOR are\nalleged to have occurred on November 16, 2003.  Applicant completed the Continuation\nSheet when he and the investigator discussed his application.  Applicant got the\nadditional information about his arrests from the court website.  Applicant used the\nwords, \u201c guesses,\u201d \u201cbelieves,\u201d \u201cI think so,\u201d and \u201cI don\u2019t remember,\u201d when answering\nquestions at the hearing on this application issue.  Applicant\u2019s answer to the\nInterrogatories on this issue were that he pushed these matters out of his mind. (Tr. 41-\n48; Exhibits 1-3)\nPolicies\nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d\n(See Regulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.)  \u201cThe standard that must be met for\n. . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the\nperson\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to\nsensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d (See\nRegulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1.) The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence\nand Security) Memorandum, dated November 19, 2004, indicates trustworthiness\nadjudications will apply to cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense Security Service\nand Office of Personnel Management.  Department of Defense contractor personnel\nare afforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any final\nunfavorable access determination may be made. (See Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.)  \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the\nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of\nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in\nthe adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a\nfair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is\n\n6\na conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d\nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\n[sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable\ntrustworthiness decision. \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nsensitive information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin\nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty\nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple\nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for criminal conduct is set\nforth in AG \u00b6 30:\nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness.  By its very nature, it calls into\nquestion a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws,\nrules and regulations. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns,\none of which may be applicable in this case.  Under AG & 31(a), \u201ca single serious crime\n\n7\nor multiple lesser offenses,\u201d and AG \u00b6 31(c), \u201callegation or admission of criminal\nconduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or\nconvicted,\u201d may raise trustworthiness concerns.  Applicant has 11 arrests or citations\ninvolving alcohol and drugs over an eight- year period, nine of which resulted in\nconvictions with fines and driving privileges suspensions as parts of the court\nsentences.  Six of these offense occurred while Applicant worked for his current\ndefense contractor employer. The evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially\ndisqualifying conditions, requiring a closer examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate\ntrustworthiness concerns arising from criminal conduct, three of which may be\napplicable:  AG \u00b6 32(a), \u201cso much time elapsed since the criminal behavior happened,\nor it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does\nnot cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;\u201d  AG  \u00b6\n32(b), \u201cthe person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those\npressures are no longer present in the person\u2019s life;\u201d and AG \u00b6 32(d), \u201cthere is evidence\nof successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time without\nrecurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher education,\ngood employment record, or constructive community involvement.\u201d  AG \u00b6 32(c)\nrequiring evidence that Applicant did not commit the alleged offenses, and AG \u00b6 32(e)\nregarding waivers of dishonorable military discharges and convictions with jail\nsentences of at least a year, are not applicable to this case on the facts.\nApplicant has the burden of proof and persuasion that the mitigating conditions\nshould apply.  Looking at those conditions and the facts of the case, Applicant\u2019s latest\noffense was November 2006, so insufficient time has elapsed to make AG \u00b6 32(a)\napplicable.  Nor were there unusual circumstances not likely to recur.  Consequently,\nthis mitigating condition is not applicable.  Applicant introduced no evidence of any\npressure to commit these 11 offenses, as required under AG \u00b6 32(b).  Finally, while\nApplicant showed he had been promoted by his employer over the past five years of\nemployment, that is insufficient evidence of successful rehabilitation for eight years of\ncriminal transgressions of the alcohol and drug laws of his state, and AG \u00b6 32(d) is not\napplicable. Therefore, Applicant failed to meet his burden, and no mitigating conditions\nare applied.\nGuideline H, Drug Involvement\nThe trustworthiness concern relating to drug involvement is set forth in AG \u00b6 24:\nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may\nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\n(a) Drugs are defined as mood and behavior altering substances,\nand include:\n\n8\n     (1) Drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified\nand listed in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g.,\nmarijuana \nor \ncannabis, \ndepressants, \nnarcotics, \nstimulants, \nand\nhallucinogens), and \n      (2) inhalants and other similar substances;\n(b) drug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a\nmanner that deviates from approved medical direction.\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns.  Under\nAG \u00b6 25(a), \u201cany drug abuse,\u201d and AG \u00b6 25(c), \u201cillegal drug possession, including\ncultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of\ndrug paraphernalia,\u201d are potentially disqualifying.  Applicant has a ten-year history of\nmarijuana use.  His last use of marijuana, according to his testimony, was in November\n2007.  He did not submit a drug screen test result to confirm he is not currently using\nmarijuana.  He was arrested four times between November 2003 and November 2006,\nfor marijuana and drug paraphernalia possession.\nThe guideline also contains potentially mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26.\nApplicant has not shown by the evidence he introduced at the hearing that any of these\nmitigating conditions apply.  AG \u00b6 26(a) requires \u201cthe behavior occurring so long ago, or\nso infrequent, or happening under circumstances which are not likely to happen again,\nso as not to cast doubt about the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment.\u201d  His marijuana use is recent and frequent, so this AG is not applicable.  AG\n\u00b6 26(b) requires \u201ca demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future,\u201d\nmanifested by four criteria, none of which Applicant has satisfied.  In fact, Applicant did\nnot use marijuana for two years, then started using it again because it made him\n\u201chappy\u201d to do so.  He has not shown there has been an appropriate period of\nabstinence at present.  AG \u00b6 26(c) refers to abuse of prescription drugs, which is not\nthe situation here.  AG \u00b6 26(d) requires a \u201csatisfactory completion of a prescribed drug\ntreatment program . . .  including a favorable prognosis from a duly qualified medical\nprofessional.\u201d Applicant does not have any assessments from the programs he\nattended in 2004 and 2005, so it cannot be determined if he successfully completed the\nprograms, or what prognosis, favorable or unfavorable, was issued.  This AG is not\napplicable.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set forth in\nAG \u00b6 15:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\n\n9\nUnder the facts of this case, AG \u00b616.a (involving deliberate omission,\nconcealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire,\npersonal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine\nemployment qualifications, or determine trustworthiness), and AG \u00b616.b (deliberately\nproviding false or misleading information concerning relevant facts to an employer,\ninvestigator, security official, or other official government representative) would seem to\napply.  \nApplicant disclosed two of his arrests, one in 2000 and the other in 2002, in\nQuestion 20 of the SF 85P he completed on May 20, 2003.  He had two lines on the\nform to use, and he used them.  The form does state, \u201cIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019, explain\nyour answer(s) in the space provided.\u201d  Applicant did that in the two lines provided.\nLater, in 2005, when interviewed by the Government investigator, he disclosed other\narrests that he obtained from the state court website.  He did not intend to leave off his\nother offenses from the AF 85P in 2003, but only followed directions explicitly.  In\naddition, throughout the hearing, Applicant testified he could not remember details of\nsome of the various arrests.  His Interrogatory answers on the disclosure issue were\nthat he pushed his arrests out of his mind.  He did disclose all of his arrests in 2005 on\nthe Continuation Sheet.  The Government was on notice in 2003, and then again in\n2005, that Applicant had arrest problems for alcohol-related problems.  Finally,\nwhatever the cause of his lack of precise recollections, I believe he genuinely could not\nremember all of these arrests, and find his explanation of a lack of intent to deceive and\nfalsify to be persuasive and credible.  Therefore, I conclude no disqualifying conditions\napply, and as a result, no mitigating conditions need be considered or applied.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the\nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should\nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature,\nextent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct,\nto include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;\n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a public trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon\ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  When these problems first began,\nApplicant was a young man. (See AG & 2(a)(4).)  He knowingly used marijuana for 10\nyears, and had 11 criminal arrests or citations over a nine-year period.  (See AG &\n2(a)(2).)   His offenses were serious, including driving while under the influence of\nalcohol, using false identification for the purposes of obtaining alcohol while a minor,\n\n10\nand possessing drug paraphernalia AG \u00b6 2(a)(1).  His use of marijuana, and alcohol,\nwere frequent, and his alcohol use continues to the present.  It is also voluntary on his\npart. AG \u00b6 2(a)(3), (5), (7), and (9).  Applicant has not undergone significant behavioral\nchanges.  He attended two alcohol and drug counseling programs, and AA meetings,\nbut returned to abusing alcohol and marijuana. (See AG & 2(a)(6).)  His past marijuana\nusage, and current alcohol consumption when placed against his history of driving\nunder the influence of alcohol, makes the potential for coercion, pressure, exploitation,\nor duress greater than normal, and demonstrates his overall lack of good judgment.\n(See AG & 2(a)(8).) \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a public trust position. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant did not mitigate the trustworthiness concerns arising from his\ncriminal conduct and drug involvement.  I conclude those trustworthiness concerns\nagainst Applicant.  I also conclude the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept against Applicant.  I\nconclude Applicant mitigated the personal conduct trustworthiness concern.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\n Subparagraphs 1.a to 1.k:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline H:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\n  Subparagraphs 2.a to 2.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT \n Subparagraph 3.a:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust\nposition.

He allowed debt to accumulate for seven years, and only commenced efforts at debt\nresolution after the Statement of Reasons (SOR) was issued.  He is financially disorganized.

The Defense Office of Hearings\n1\nand Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  As required\nby Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended\nand modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 \u00b6 E3.1.2 Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended, modified, and revised, DOHA issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) on August 23, 2006, detailing the basis for its decision \u2013 security\nconcerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct)\nof the Directive.  The President issued revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) on December 30, 2005.\nDoD implemented them effective September 1, 2006.  Pending official amendment/reissue of DoD\nDirective 5220.6, the AG are to be used in all cases when the SOR is issued on or after September\n1, 2006.  Because the SOR was issued prior to September 1, 2006, DOHA policy requires that this\ncase proceed under the old guidelines.  \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on October 11, 2006, and elected to have a hearing\nbefore an administrative judge.  The case was assigned to me on January 3, 2007.  The Notice of\nHearing was dated on January 23, 2007, to convene a hearing on February 15, 2007, to consider\nwhether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for\nApplicant.  The government offered six exhibits, marked as Exhibits 1-6, with Exhibit 6 being a\nrebuttal exhibit.  Applicant offered eleven exhibits, marked as exhibits A-K.  I kept the record open\nuntil March 1, 2007, to allow Applicant the time to file additional documents.  He filed three\ndocuments that were marked as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits L, M, and N.  The government had no objection\nand Exhibits L, M, and N were admitted.  The government filed one exhibit marked as Exhibit 7,\nand without objection it was admitted.  DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on February 26,\n2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted the allegations contained in SOR subparagraphs 1.a., 1.i., and 1.j.  He\ndenied all other allegations in the SOR.  The admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact.\nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of\nsame, I make the following additional findings of fact: \nApplicant is a 30-year-old engineering technician (explosives operator) employed by a federal\ncontractor.   He was divorced in 2004 and has one child.   He is a high school graduate and has one\n2\n3\nand half years\u2019 credit towards a college degree.

Of that amount, he disputed\nthree debts that totaled $41,266, he paid six debts totaling $2,397, and two debts for $3,990 and $502\nremained unpaid.  On September 22, 2006, he was provided a validation of the $3,990 debt from a\ncollection agency.   The $502 debt is on the latest credit report.   He claimed that the debt listed\n18\n19\nin SOR subparagraph 1.b. was for a mobile home that he and his ex-wife purchased jointly, but his\nex-wife kept after they separated and divorced.   Although the debt did not appear on the most\n20\nrecent credit report , he provided no information about whether or not the debt is paid  or unpaid.\n21\nThe real estate foreclosure debt listed in SOR subparagraph 1.h. does not appear on the latest credit\nreport.   There was correspondence between Applicant and the debtor listed in SOR subparagraph\n22\n1.k., but it did not clarify whether or not the debt was owed.  This debt is not listed in the latest credit\nreport.   He did not provide corroboration or documentation showing how he disputed the debts.\n23\nApplicant stated that he depended upon his wife to pay bills during several deployments.  He\nmentioned one bill that she had not paid in 1997 , and the next time he became aware of his bad\n24\ndebts and financial issues involving his ex-wife was during an interview with a Defense Security\nService (DSS) agent in February 2006.   He told the agent he would obtain a copy of his credit\n25\nreport and look into the matters.   He took care of his own finances after they separated in 1999.\n26\n27\nThey were divorced May 6, 2004, but the decree is silent about division of marital property.   His\n28\nmonthly surplus of income over expenses was $1,000 in February 2006, and $1,600 in February\n2007.29\nPersonal Conduct\n\nSOR.\n30\nId.\n31\nTr. at 91-93.\n32\n6\nApplicant falsified material facts on his security clearance application, which he caused to\nbe electronically transmitted on or about September 11, 2003, on which he was required to reply to\nthe following question: \u201c38. Your financial delinquencies-180 days.  In the last 7 years, have you\never been over 180 days delinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d; to which he answered \u201cNo.\u201d  He also  falsified\nmaterial facts on that same SF-86, on which he was required to reply to the following question: \u201c39.\nYour financial delinquencies-90 days.  Are you currently over 90 days delinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d;\nto which he answered \u201cNo.\u201d  He deliberately failed to list the information about his delinquent debts\nas discussed in the previous section.30\nApplicant falsified material facts on an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations\nProcessing (e-QIP), executed by him on October 25, 2005, on which he was required to reply to the\nfollowing question: \u201c28.a. Your financial delinquencies-180 days.  In the last 7 years, have you\never been over 180 days delinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d; to which he answered \u201cNo.\u201d  He also  falsified\nmaterial facts on that same e-QIP, on which he was required to reply to the following question:\n\u201c28.b. Your financial delinquencies-90 days.  Are you currently over 90 days delinquent on any\ndebt(s)?\u201d; to which he answered \u201cNo.\u201d  He deliberately failed to list the information about his\ndelinquent debts as discussed in the previous section.31\nApplicant was asked why he listed no debts on his security clearance applications:\nQ.  And why did you answer, \u201cNo?\u201d  \nA.  Because at the time when I was filling this out, I did not know I had any financial\ndelinquencies because nothing had changed between, financially nothing had changed from 2003 to\n2005.  And in 2003 I was granted a security clearance.  So I thought that everything was good.  I fill\nthe questionnaire out.  I got a security clearance.  And I didn\u2019t work there anymore.  I went to\ncollege.  Got out of college.  Went to get work at a different company that required a security\nclearance.  And fill this out.  And nothing had changed financially.\nQ.  But you had divorced in 2004.\nA.  Right.\nQ.  That changed.\nA.  Right.  Just the marital status.  But I mean, as far as financial obligations within that time\nperiod, I had no reason to think that I had past due accounts because in 2003 when I filled it out and\nsaid, \u201cNo,\u201d and I got it, I mean, to the best of my knowledge it was, no.  I got a security clearance\nso I thought I had no reason to think any different.  2005 came around.  I applied for another security\nclearance.  Same questionnaire.  Nothing had changed from 2003 2005.32\n\n\u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a\n33\nconclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4,\n2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1).  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of\ndrawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported\nby substantial evidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966).  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d\nis \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v.Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375,\n380 (4  Cir. 1994).\nth\n \n7\nPOLICIES\nIn an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s security suitability, an administrative judge must consider\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive, which sets forth adjudicative guidelines.  In addition to brief\nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines are divided into\nDisqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC), which are used to determine an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law.  Instead, recognizing\nthe complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge should apply these guidelines in\nconjunction with the factors listed below.  An administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal\nis a fair, impartial and common sense decision.\nBecause the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept,\u201d an administrative judge should consider all available, reliable information\nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision.\nSpecifically, an administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors\nlisted at Directive \u00b6 E2.2.1: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency\nand recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the\nvoluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nSince the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision\nin each case is arrived at by applying the standard that the issuance of the clearance is \u201cclearly\nconsistent with the interests of national security.\u201d  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those\nconclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence contained in the record.  Likewise,\nI have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d  The\ngovernment initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a potentially disqualifying\ncondition under the Directive.  Once the government has produced substantial evidence of a\ndisqualifying condition, the burden shifts to the applicant to produce evidence and prove a mitigating\ncondition.   Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 provides, \u201cThe applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and\n33\nother evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by\nDepartment Counsel, and [applicant] has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a\n\nSee ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  ?The Administrative Judge [considers] the record\n34\nevidence as a whole, both favorable and unfavorable, [evaluates] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light\nof pertinent provisions of the Directive, and [decides] whether Applicant [has] met his burden of persuasion under\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006).\n8\nfavorable clearance decision.\u201d  The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the\ngovernment.34\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with\nthe government predicated upon trust and confidence.  It is a relationship that transcends normal duty\nhours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well.  It is because of this special relationship the\ngovernment must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to\nwhom it grants access to classified information.  Decisions under this Directive include, by necessity,\nconsideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information.  Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible\nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nThe scope of an administrative judge\u2019s decision is limited.  Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty,\nand patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings.  Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically\nprovides industrial security clearance decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall\nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  Security clearance\ndecisions cover many characteristics of an applicant other than allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism.\nNothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or\nin part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.\nCONCLUSIONS\nFinancial Considerations\nThe government established its case under Guideline F.  Financial Considerations\nDisqualifying Condition (FC DC) E2.A6.1.2.1. arises where there is (A history of not meeting\nfinancial obligations.)  Similarly, FC DC E2.A6.1.2.3. applies where the information shows an\n(Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.)  The available information demonstrates Applicant has\na history of not meeting his financial obligations.  He has been delinquent in paying his debts, since\nat least 1999.\nVarious conditions can mitigate the security concerns arising from financial difficulties.  The\nDirective sets out Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition (FC MC) E2.A6.1.3.3. (The\nconditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or\nseparation).  Applicant and his ex-wife separated in 1999.  He stated he did not know where she was\nliving when he returned from an overseas deployment.  They divorced in 2004.  The divorce decree\nmade no division of property.  He took care of his own finances from 1999 to 2006.  His monthly\ncash flow showed a surplus.  He claimed he did not know about these delinquent debts until February\n2006.  What all of this demonstrates is that there is severe financial disorganization in his life.  And\nthis may indicate how organized or disorganized he might be in handling classified information.\n\nDirective \u00b6 E.2.2.1.\n35\nId.\n36\n9\nApplicant claimed that many of these debts belonged to his ex-wife, even though they were\njointly established.  He co-signed for the purchase of a mobile home, but provided no documents that\nthe loan had been paid or unpaid.  To claim no knowledge of his delinquent debts from 1999 until\n2006 is not believable.  He knew in 1997 that his former spouse had not paid at least one debt, so\nhe was on notice that there could be a potential problem.  And he took no action about these debts\nuntil the SOR was filed, about seven months after his DSS interview.\nFC MC E2.A6.1.3.4. (The person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and\nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control) does not apply.\nThere is no evidence of financial counseling, and his debts are neither resolved nor under control.\nFC MC E2.A6.1.3.6. (The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors\nor otherwise resolve bad debts) is inapplicable.  Applicant made little effort at payment until after\nthe SOR was filed.  He has not resolved his indebtedness.  No other mitigating conditions apply.\nI conclude Guideline F against Applicant.\nPersonal Conduct\nConduct involving questionable judgment, unreliability, lack of candor, or dishonesty could\nindicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.\nThe government established its case under Guideline E.  Personal Conduct Disqualifying\nCondition (PC DC) E2.A5.1.2.2. (The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant\nand material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar\nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities) is\nthe standard.  The operative word is \u201cdeliberate.\u201d  Applicant had delinquent debts since at least 1999.\nHis explanation for the omissions is not credible.  No mitigating conditions apply.  I conclude\nGuideline E against Applicant.\nWhole Person Analysis\n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.\u201d   \u201cAvailable,\n35\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be\nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u201d   In evaluating Applicant\u2019s case, in addition to the\n36\ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions, I also considered the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d in evaluating\n\nId.\n37\n10\nApplicant\u2019s risk and vulnerability in protecting our national interests.   Applicant ignored his debts\n37\nuntil the SOR was issued, six months after he claimed he first learned of past due debts..  He has not\nadequately addressed the status of the unpaid and disputed debts.\nApplicant falsified two security clearance applications.  This is problematic because candor\nwith the government about a person\u2019s embarrassing information is the crux of a trustworthiness and\nsecurity determination.  If a person discloses their personal adverse information, then he or she is\nmore likely to be trustworthy with confidential or classified information.  The totality of the record\nraises reasonable and persistent doubts about Applicant\u2019s ability to protect classified information and\nto exercise the requisite good judgment and discretion expected of one in whom the government\nentrusts its interests and secrets.  I conclude it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to\ngrant Applicant a security clearance.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact of this decision, infra. 3On Aug. 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a memorandum directing application of revised Adjudicative Guideline to all adjudications and other determinations made under the Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program (Regulation), dated Jan. 1987, as amended, in which the SOR was issued on or after Sep. 1, 2006. The revised Adjudicative Guidelines are not applicable to Applicant\u2019s case because his SOR was issued on Aug. 23, 2006. 4Item 4 (Applicant\u2019s response to SOR) is dated Sep. 21, 2006.

There is no allegation of falsification of Applicant\u2019s 2004 EPSQ 86.   \n \n2Item 1 (Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated Aug. 23, 2006). Item I is the source for the facts in \nthe remainder of this paragraph unless stated otherwise. \n \nMarch 13, 2008\n\n \n2 \n                                                                                                                                                             \n1, 2008. \n                                                          \n1992, as amended and modified.3 The SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline \nB (Foreign Influence). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the \npreliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for him, and recommended \nreferral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, \ncontinued, denied, or revoked. \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR allegations, and elected to have his case \ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.4 A complete copy of the file of \nrelevant material (FORM), dated August 27, 2007, was provided to him, and he was \nafforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, \nor mitigation.5 Applicant did not provide a response to the FORM. The case was \nassigned to me on January 3\n \nProcedural Ruling \n \nDepartment Counsel requested administrative notice of the facts in the FORM \nconcerning the Russian Federation (FORM at page 3-7) and supporting documents to \nshow detail and context for the facts in the FORM (Ex. I to VIII\u2014listed in FORM at 7). \nApplicant did not object to me taking administrative notice.   \n \nAdministrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for \nadministrative proceedings. See ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4 n.1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, \n2007); ISCR Case No. 02-24875 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. \n02-18668 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2004)); McLeod v. Immigration and Naturalization  \nService, 802 F.2d 89, 93 n.4 (3d Cir. 1986)). The most common basis for administrative \nnotice at ISCR proceedings, is to notice facts that are either well known or from \ngovernment reports. See Stein, ADMINISTRATIVE LAW, Section 25.01 (Bender & Co. \n2006) (listing fifteen types of facts for administrative notice). In addition to the facts \noutlined in the FORM at 3-7, I have taken administrative notice of facts in Exhibits I to \nVIII. See the Russian Federation section of the Findings of Fact of this decision, infra. \n \n \n \n3On Aug. 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a memorandum \ndirecting application of revised Adjudicative Guideline to all adjudications and other determinations made \nunder the Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program \n(Regulation), dated Jan. 1987, as amended, in which the SOR was issued on or after Sep. 1, 2006.

He also provided an explanation for all \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d to 1.g. His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a \ncomplete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of \nfact.   \n \n \nApplicant is 47 years old (Item 5). He was born in Greece, and received a degree \nfrom a Russian University in 1981 (Item 5 at 1, 3).  In 1984, he married his first wife in \nMoscow (Item 5 at 5).  They divorced in 1996. Id. In 1985, his first son was born in \nMoscow. Id. In 1996, he married his current wife, who is a U.S. citizen (Item 5 at 4). In \n1997 and 2003, his second and third sons were born in the United States (Item 5 at 6).  \nHis first son became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1996 (Item 5 at 5).    \n \nFrom 1981 to 1989, Applicant worked for a Union of Soviet Socialist Republics \n(USSR) Ministry in the USSR and overseas that had important and sensitive \nresponsibilities for foreign affairs and national security (Item 5 at 6-7). However, he has \nnot had any contact since 1989 with any employees from this Ministry (Item 6 at 2). He \nwas a member of the USSR Communist Party from June 1989 until August 1989 (Item 5 \nat 9).7 In August 1989, he terminated his Communist Party membership and requested \npolitical asylum in the United States (Item 5 at 7). In March 1996, he became a U.S. \ncitizen (Item 5 at 7).   \n \nApplicant\u2019s contacts with Russian government officials after he emigrated from \nRussia in 1989 were \u201cofficial,\u201d as they were all related to his employment with U.S. \ncorporations. From 1996 to 2001, Applicant held U.S. corporate employment that \nresulted in frequent contact with Russian officials (Item 6 at 2-3). From October 2002 to \nDecember 2003, Applicant lived in Russia on behalf of a U.S. corporation, and had \nregular contact with Russian government officials employed by an important Russian \ngovernment agency. Id.; Item 5 at 7. From October 1998 to October 2002, Applicant \ntraveled to Russia more than 20 times (Item 6 at 3-6). The U.S. Government reaped \nsome benefit of his travel to Russia and employment with the U.S. corporations (Item 4 \nat 2).  He currently has an official U.S. Government passport. Id.  The record does not \ninclude information about his travel to Russia after December 2003. \n   \n  \nApplicant\u2019s parents are currently citizens and residents of Russia.8 He has \nmonthly, telephonic contact with his parents. His father retired from an important city \ngovernmental position, and until about 10 years ago, his mother was employed by the \nRussian and/or USSR Government. His father receives a disability pension. His mother \nwas a well-known public figure, and frequently presented a radio show at an \n \n6 The facts in this decision do not specifically describe employment or locations in order to protect \nApplicant and his family\u2019s privacy.  The cited sources contain more specific information.  \n \n7 Applicant was coerced into joining the Communist Party (Item 5 at 17, Item 6 at 7). \n \n8 Items 4 and 6 are the sources for the facts in this paragraph, unless stated otherwise. \n \n\n \n4 \n                                                                                                                                                             \n                                                          \nindependent radio station.  His mother visited Applicant in the United States three times, \nand his father visited Applicant in the United States twice. They stayed at Applicant\u2019s \nresidence. His parents do not plan to immigrate to the United States. Applicant does not \nprovide financial support to them.  \n \nApplicant had part ownership in an apartment located in Russia.9 His share was \nvalued at $8,000 to $9,000. He was receiving $200 per month in rent, which he used to \npay utilities. Most likely the apartment became the property of the Russian Government \nin February 2007 because of Applicant\u2019s acceptance of U.S. political asylum.       \n \nThe Russian Federation10 \n \nThe Russian Federation is a vast and diverse country.  It is about twice the size \nof the United States, and has a population of 142 million people. It achieved \nindependence with the dissolution of the Soviet Union on August 24, 1991.     \n \nThe threat of terrorism in Russia continues to be significant. Travel in the areas in \nthe vicinity of Chechnya may be dangerous, despite Russian efforts to suppress the \nterrorists. Acts of terrorism include taking hostages and bombings. Applicant\u2019s parents \ndo not live in Chechnya. \n \nRussia has recognized the legitimacy of international human rights standards, \nbut in Chechnya the treatment of some prisoners and detainees violates human rights \nstandards. Russia has a large prison population, and prison conditions are below \ninternational standards. The Russian Government has weakened freedom of the press \nby eliminating some television networks and by encouraging self-censorship.   \n \nThe Russian Federation\u2019s intelligence capability is significant and focuses on \ncollection of information from the United States.11 The old Soviet Union engaged in a \nseries of high profile espionage missions against the United States.  The Russian \nFederation continued in this tradition. The 2004 Intelligence Threat Handbook (2004 \nITH) states, \u201cThe FBI estimates that more than 105,000 Russians immigrated to the \nUnited States in the late 1980s. The Russians, like many intelligence services have \ntraditionally used \u00e9migr\u00e9s to gather intelligence.\u201d Id. at 16. However, the specific \nespionage examples cited in the 2004 ITH involved native-born U.S. citizens or Russian \ndiplomats, and none involved Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9s.    \n \n \n9 Item 5 at 6, and Item 6 at 2 are the sources for the facts in this paragraph. \n \n10Exhibit IV (\u201cRussian Political, Economic, and Security Issues and U.S. Interests,\u201d Congressional \nResearch Service Report, May 31, 2007) and the FORM pages 3-7 are the source for the facts in this \nsection, unless stated otherwise.   \n \n11 Exhibit VI, (\u201cIntelligence Threat Handbook,\u201d Centre for Counterintelligence and Security Studies \nfor the Interagency Operational Security Support Staff, June 2004) is the source for the facts in this \nparagraph. \n \n\n \n5 \n                                                                                                                                                             \n                                                          \nThe relationship between the United States and Russia remains complicated.  \nThe United States and Russia share common interests on a broad range of issues, \nincluding the reduction of strategic arsenals, prevention of the spread of weapons of \nmass destruction, and in combating terrorism. Since 1992, the United States has spent \nover $7 billion in Cooperative Threat Reduction funds and related programs to reduce \nthe threat of Russian weapons of mass destruction. Billions of dollars have also been \nallocated to aid Russian democratization and market reform. Recently, however, the \nRussian-U.S. relationship shows more discord than in previous years because for \nexample, Russia has opposed deployment of a U.S.-developed missile defense system \nin Poland. Nevertheless, there are important areas of continued cooperation. Russia \nand the United States seek to compel Iran to bring its nuclear programs into compliance \nwith International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) rules. Specifically, on March 24, 2007, \nRussia voted with the United States on a UN Security Council resolution that tightens \neconomic and political sanctions on Iran because of Iran\u2019s nuclear program.    \n \nPolicies \n \n \nIn an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s security suitability, an administrative judge must \nconsider Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which sets forth adjudicative guidelines. In \naddition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines \nare divided into Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC), which are \nused to determine an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge should apply \nthese guidelines in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process \nprovision in Section E2.2, Enclosure 2, of the Directive.  An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \n \nBecause the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d an administrative judge should consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. \n \nSince the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the \nfinal decision in each case is arrived at by applying the standard that the issuance of the \nclearance is \u201cclearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.12 The government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish \n \n12 \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as \nadequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-\n11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1).  \u201cThis is something less than the weight \nof the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not \n\n \n6 \n                                                                                                                                                             \n                                                                                                                                                                                          \na potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive. Once the government has \nproduced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to produce evidence and prove a mitigating condition. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 \nprovides, \u201cThe applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to \nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by \nDepartment Counsel, and [applicant] has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to \nobtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d The burden of disproving a mitigating \ncondition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. \nSep. 22, 2005).13 \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. It is a \nrelationship that transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours \nas well. It is because of this special relationship the government must be able to repose \na high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions under this Directive include, by necessity, \nconsideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to \nprotect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of \nlegally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise \nof classified information. \n  \nThe scope of an administrative judge\u2019s decision is limited. Applicant\u2019s allegiance, \nloyalty, and patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings.  Section 7 of Executive \nOrder 10865 specifically provides industrial security clearance decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d  See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. \nSecurity clearance decisions cover many characteristics of an applicant other than \nallegiance, loyalty, and patriotism.  Nothing in this Decision should be construed to \nsuggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied \ndetermination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly \nabove, I conclude the following with respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR: \n \n \n \n \n \nprevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime \nComm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966).  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a \npreponderance.\u201d  See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \n \n13\u201fThe Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and \nunfavorable, [evaluates] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the \nDirective, and [decides] whether Applicant [has] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d  \nISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006).  \n\n \n7 \n                                                                                                                                                             \nForeign Influence \n \nDirective \u00b6 E2.A2.1.1 describes why a security concern may exist under \nGuideline B:  \n \nwhen an individual\u2019s immediate family, including cohabitants, and other \npersons to whom he or she may be bound by affection, influence, or \nobligation are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to \nduress.  These situations could create the potential for foreign influence \nthat could result in the compromise of classified information. Contacts with \ncitizens of other countries or financial interests in other countries are also \nrelevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially \nvulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure. \n \nTwo of eight possible foreign influence disqualifying conditions (FI DC) could \nraise a security concern in this case. FI DC 1 applies where an \u201cimmediate family \nmember, or a person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a \ncitizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign country.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E2.A2.1.2.1. \n\u201cImmediate family members\u201d include a spouse, father, mother, sons, daughters, \nbrothers, and sisters.  Directive \u00b6 E2.A2.1.3.1. FI DC 6 applies where there is  \n\u201c[c]onduct which may make the individual vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or \npressure by a foreign government.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E2.A2.1.2.6. \n \nI disagree with the contention in the FORM that FI DC 3, \u201cRelatives, cohabitants, \nor associates who are connected with any foreign government,\u201d and FIDC 8, \u201cA \nsubstantial financial interest in a country, or in any foreign-owned or -operated business \nthat could make the individual vulnerable to foreign influence\u201d apply.14 The Russian \nGovernment does not currently employ his parents. The information about their receipt \nof Russian pensions is not sufficiently specific for application of FI DC 3. Applicant said \nhe thought his property interest in a Russian apartment was terminated in 2007, ending \nthe applicability of FI DC 8.  \n \nI agree with the FORM that FI DCs 1 and 6 apply. Applicant\u2019s father and mother \nare \u201cimmediate family members\u201d and persons to whom he \u201chas close ties of affection or \nobligation.\u201d They are also citizens of and live in Russia. Even if only one relative lives in \nRussia, this factor alone is sufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and \ncould potentially result in the compromise of classified information. See ISCR Case No. \n03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006). The mere possession of close family ties with a \nperson in a foreign country is not, as a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. \nISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001). However, such ties in this case do \nraise a security concern under FI DCs 1 and 6 because his parents were Russian \ngovernment employees with significant stature. Moreover, Applicant himself had \nsensitive, national security-related employment with the USSR Government from 1981 \nto 1989. After immigrating to the United States in 1989, Applicant obtained U.S. \ncorporate employment which resulted in more than 20 trips to Russia, and from October \n                                                          \n14 Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E2.A2.1.2.3 and E2.A2.1.2.8.  \n\n \n8 \n                                                                                                                                                             \n2002 to December 2003, he lived in Russia. His connections to Russia are sufficiently \nsignificant to make him vulnerable to Russian coercion, exploitation or pressure.   \n \nApplicant is required to present evidence of rebuttal, extenuation or mitigation \nsufficient to meet his burden of persuasion that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for him.   \n \nSecurity concerns based on foreign influence can be mitigated by showing that \nany of the five foreign influence mitigating conditions (FI MC) apply. FI MC 1 recognizes \nthat security concerns are reduced when the \u201cimmediate family member(s), (spouse, \nfather mother, sons, daughters, brothers, sisters), cohabitant, or associate(s) in \nquestion are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign \npower in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the person(s) \ninvolved and the United States.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E2.A2.1.3.1. Notwithstanding the facially \ndisjunctive language of FI MC 1, the Appeal Board has decided that an Applicant must \nprove that his family members, cohabitant or associates are not agents of a foreign \npower, and are not in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could \nforce Applicant to chose between the person(s) involved and the United States.  ISCR \nCase No. 02-14995 at 5 (App. Bd. July 26, 2004). \n \nThe Appeal Board, however, does not apply the statutory definition of \u201cagent of a \nforeign power.\u201d Instead, the Appeal Board has held that \u201cAn employee of a foreign \ngovernment need not be employed at a high level or in a position involving intelligence, \nmilitary, or other national security duties to be an agent of a foreign power for purposes \nof Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition 1.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-24254 (App. Bd. Jun. \n29, 2004). In a series of decisions, the Appeal Board has broadly defined \u201cagent of a \nforeign power.\u201d15   \n \nThe second prong of FI MC 1 provides that it is potentially mitigating where the \n\u201cassociate(s) in question are not . . . in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a \nway that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the person involved and \nthe United States.\u201d The Appeal Board interprets this language as establishing a very \nhigh standard; i.e., an applicant must affirmatively prove that there is at most a slight \npossibility that anyone might attempt to exploit or influence a foreign relative or \nacquaintance in the future.  See ISCR Case No. 03-17620 at 4 (App. Bd. Apr. 17, 2006) \n(stating, \u201c[FI MC] 1 does not apply because, as is well settled, it requires that Applicant \ndemonstrate that his relatives are not in a position which could force Applicant to \n                                                          \n15The discussion in this opinion of FI MC 1 relies heavily on and occasionally quotes without \nattribution the discussion of this same issue in ISCR Case No. 03-10312 at 6-9 (A.J. May 31, 2006).  See \nalso ISCR Case No. 03-10954 at 3 (App. Bd.

Feb. 15, 2005).  \n \nFI MC 1 does not, by its express terms, exclude from consideration applicants \nwith relatives or associates in countries where terrorism has occurred, any more than it \nexcludes person from countries where there are foreign governments, foreign political \norganizations, or foreign non-governmental organizations.  Rather, it focuses on a very \nspecific type of threat\u2013the risk of a foreign power exploiting an applicant\u2019s foreign \nrelatives in such a way as to cause an applicant to act adversely to the interests of the \nUnited States. The Appeal Board has limited the applicability of FI MC 1 where there is \na history of terrorist activity in the foreign country in question.  ISCR Case No. 03-22643 \n(App. Bd. Jun. 24, 2005); ISCR Case No. 02-22461 at 5 (App. Bd. Oct. 22, 2005). \n \nHis father and mother are citizens and residents of Russia. The evidence does \nnot establish that his family members living in Russia are Russian agents or that they \nare agents of any other foreign power.   \n \nThe nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and \nits human rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family \nmembers are vulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or \nduress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a \nfamily member is associated with or dependent upon the government, or the country is \nknown to conduct intelligence operations against the United States. The complicated \nrelationship of Russia to the United States places a significant, but not insurmountable \nburden of persuasion on Applicant to demonstrate that his immediate family members in \nRussia do not pose security risk and he is not in a position to be forced to choose \nbetween loyalty to the United States and his family members.16 With its occasionally \nadversarial stance and its mixed human rights record, it is conceivable that Russia \nwould target any citizen in an attempt to gather information from the United States. \n \nThere is no evidence that his elderly father and mother are or have been, political \nactivists, challenging the policies of the Russian Government. Although Applicant and \nhis parents were employees of the USSR and/or Russian governments, they do not \ncurrently work for the Russian Government or military or any news media.  There is no \nevidence that terrorists have approached or threatened Applicant or his parents for any \nreason. There is no evidence the Russian Government has approached Appellant \n(unrelated to his U.S. corporate employment). There is no evidence that his parents \nliving in Russia currently engage in activities which would bring attention to themselves \nor that they are even aware of Applicant\u2019s work. As such, there is a reduced possibility \nthat they would be targets for coercion or exploitation by the Russian Government, \n \n16 An applicant with relatives in Iran, for example, has a much heavier burden to overcome than \nan applicant with relatives living in Russia. See ISCR Case No. 02-13595 at 3 (App. Bd. May 10, 2005) \n(stating an applicant has \u201ca very heavy burden of persuasion to overcome the security concerns\u201d when \nparents and siblings live in Iran).

See also \nISCR Case No. 06-17164 at 15 (A.J. Oct. 23, 2007) (listing 23 consecutive cases involving U.S. citizens \nwith Iranian connections whose clearances were denied). \n \n\n \n10 \n                                                                                                                                                             \nwhich may seek to quiet those which speak out against it.  Applicant deserves some \ncredit because of the reduced possibility that Russia will exploit his family; however, FI \nMC 1 cannot be applied in this case.  Even if there was substantial evidence of the \n\u201cfamily members\u2019 low-key noncontroversial lifestyle, and the fact that the [Russian \nGovernment] has not contacted them about Applicant in the past, such factors are \ninsufficient to support the application of FI MC 1\u201d because of the nature of the Russian \nGovernment and its complicated, and sometimes contentious relationship to the United \nStates.    \n \nFI MC 2 can mitigate security concerns where \u201c[c]ontacts with foreign citizens are \nthe result of official United States Government business.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E2.A2.1.3.2.  \nApplicant said that the U.S. Government benefited from his visits to Russia.  However, \nhis employment was with U.S. corporations, not with the U.S. Government.  He did not \nprovide sufficient details or any corroboration to establish his manifestly very significant \ncontacts with Russian citizens and Russian government officials from 1996 to \nDecember 2003 resulted from official U.S. Government business. \n \nFI MC 3 can mitigate security concerns where \u201ccontact and correspondence with \nforeign citizens are casual and infrequent.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E2.A2.1.3.3. Applicant has \nmonthly contacts by telephone with his parents living in Russia, and they visit him \nand/or stayed with him five times (twice for father, thrice for mother) when they visit the \nUnited States.  He probably visited them when he visited Russia more twenty times over \nduring the last ten years. FI MC 3 does not apply because his contacts with them are \nnot casual and infrequent. See ISCR Case No. 04-12500 at 2, 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, \n2006) (finding contacts with applicant\u2019s parents and sisters a total of about 20 times per \nyear not casual and infrequent); ISCR Case No. 04-09541 at 2-3 (App. Bd.

See ISCR Case No. 04-12500 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, \n2006). Moreover, contacts with such family members are presumed to be \u201cnot casual.\u201d Id.

The adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in \nconsidering the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by \nthe totality of his or her acts, omissions, and motivations as well as various other \nvariables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into consideration all \nrelevant circumstances and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful \nanalysis.  Under the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge should consider \nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at Directive \u00b6 E2.2.1:  \n \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) The \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) The frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) The \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) The \nvoluntariness of participation; (6) The presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) The motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) The likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E2.2.3, \u201cThe ultimate determination of whether the granting or \ncontinuing of eligibility for a security clearance is clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security must be an overall common sense determination based upon careful \nconsideration\u201d of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nA Guideline B decision concerning Russia must take into consideration the \ngeopolitical situation in Russia, as well as the dangers existing in Russia.18 Russia is a \ndiplomatic and strategic partner of the United States in some areas where both \ncountries have mutual interests. Russia is a key partner in the search for peace in the \nMiddle East and resolution of problems with Iraq and Iran. Russia was an important ally \nin World War II, and then our greatest antagonist during the Cold War.  Russia has a \nmixed human rights record and like the United States has been subject to terrorist \nattacks. Russia is a known collector of U.S. intelligence and sensitive economic \ninformation.  \n   \nApplicant did not mitigate the government\u2019s security concerns over possible \nforeign influence raised by his visits to Russia because he traveled to Russia more than \n20 times between 1998 and October 2002. He lived in Russia from October 2002 to \nDecember 2003. The file does not indicate whether or not he traveled to Russia after \nDecember 2003. He travelled to Russia with the permission of his U.S. corporate \nemployers, and his contacts with Russian citizens and Russian government employees \nbenefited the U.S. Government.  He did not, however, provide witness statements about \nhis contacts with Russian citizens and Russian government employees, who could \ncorroborate his contentions about the U.S. Government benefits resulting from his \ncontacts with Russian citizens and Russian government employees.  \n                                                          \n18 See ISCR Case No. 04-02630 at 3 (App. Bd. May 23, 2007) (remanding because of insufficient \ndiscussion of geopolitical situation and suggesting expansion of whole person discussion).  \n\n \n12 \n                                                                                                                                                             \n                                                          \nApplicant's ties to his parents living in Russia with whom he has monthly \ntelephone conversations as well as his frequent visits to Russia establish his close ties \nof affection to them. There is a possibility Applicant could be placed in a position of \nhaving to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or \ngovernment and the interests of the United States.  \n \nApplicant has lived in the United States since 1989 (except for the 15 months he \nlived in Russia in 2002-2003). He became a U.S. citizen in 1996. His wife and three \nsons are U.S. citizens. However, he did not fully develop the evidence showing his \nconnections to the United States. He did not provide corroborating statements \nconcerning his loyalty and trustworthiness.  He did not provide any recommendations of \nemployers, neighbors, friends, or family members supporting his application for a \nsecurity clearance. After weighing the evidence of his connections to Russia, and to the \nUnited States, I conclude Applicant has not carried his burden of mitigating the foreign \ninfluence security concern.  \n \n           I take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d19 and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities under the Guidelines. For the \nreasons stated, I conclude he is not eligible for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:    \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b to 1.c: \n For Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.d to 1.e: \n Against Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security \nclearance for Applicant.

Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro se\nSYNOPSIS\n\nThis action was taken under Executive Order 10865, dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive\n1\n5220.6, dated January 2,1992, as amended and modified (Directive).\nTr. 43.\n2\nExhibit A, Performance Evaluation, dated March 7, 2006, at 6.\n3\nExhibit B, Performance Evaluation, dated February 26, 2007, at 5.\n4\n2\nIn 2003, while in the process of filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, Applicant concealed her\nemployment status, several financial transactions, and more than $130,000 of assets from the\nbankruptcy court. Subsequently the trustee filed a lawsuit against her, which is still pending. These\nissues raise security concerns that Applicant failed to mitigate. Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn August 30, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to\nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) stating it was unable to find it clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance.  Applicant filed an undated answer\n1\nrequesting a hearing.\nThe case was assigned to me on February 23, 2007. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on\nMarch 6, 2007, scheduling it for March 23, 2007. The hearing was held as scheduled. During the\nhearing, I received seven government exhibits, nine Applicant exhibits, and Applicant\u2019s testimony.\nAlso, at the government\u2019s request, I took administrative notice of 11 U.S.C. Ann. \u00a7727 (2006) which\nsets forth the criteria governing Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharges. DOHA received the transcript on\nApril 10, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT \nApplicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated as findings of fact. In addition, I make the following\nfindings of fact.\nApplicant is a 42-year-old married woman with a three-year-old child. She earned a college\ndegree in communications in 1989 and a master\u2019s degree in business administration in 1992. For the\npast three years, she has worked in the quality assurance field for a software development company.2\nHer supervisor describes her as a \u201cjewel\u201d  to the company who is \u201cconsistently one of the top\n3\nperformers. . . .\u201d4\nThroughout the 1990s, Applicant earned a high salary. Because she had no student loans,\nno children, and a husband who also earned income, she was able to enjoy a comfortable lifestyle.\nAmong other things, she frequently took tropical vacations. On one occasion, she purchased a work\n\nTr. 50, 52.\n5\nTr. 46.\n6\nTr. 71.\n7\nTr. 70.\n8\nExhibit 1, Security Clearance Application, dated July 15, 2005, at 27.\n9\nExhibit 3, Agreement for Sale, executed June 6, 2003.\n10\nId. at Paragraph 2.\n11\nTr. 111.\n12\nId.\n13\nTr. 77.\n14\nId.\n15\n3\nof art for $5,000. During this period, she incurred between $45,000 and $60,000 of credit card debt,\nbut never had trouble satisfying it in a timely manner.  \n5\nIn May 2001, Applicant lost her job, and was unable to obtain a full-time job until nearly two\nyears later.  During this time, her husband, who only earned a fraction of the income Applicant\n6\nearned before her unemployment, was unable to support them both, and they began to have difficulty\nsatisfying their debts.  During her unemployment, she started a network marketing business, but it\nwas unsuccessful, leading to the accrual of more debt.  \n7\nWhile unemployed, Applicant did not curtail her spending.  On one occasion in October\n8\n2002, she went on another tropical vacation.  In March 2003, she obtained a full-time job. She has\n9\nbeen employed continuously since then.\nIn June 2003, Applicant\u2019s husband entered into an agreement to purchase an undeveloped\nparcel of real estate in a foreign country.  His intention was to build a resort. According to the\n10\nagreement, he was to pay the seller $130,000 in several increments over six months in exchange for\nthe property.  Although Applicant did not sign the agreement, she considered it a joint venture,\n11\ncharacterizing it as \u201can investment in the future for us all,\u201d  and \u201cour dream that we were chasing.\u201d\n12\n13\nApplicant and her husband made an initial deposit of $5,000 three days after the agreement\u2019s\nexecution. Approximately three weeks later, they paid $60,000 toward the purchase price.14\nApproximately half of this sum was generated through the refinance of their home, and the other half\nwas generated from her husband\u2019s business.  In July 2003, Applicant and her husband took a\n15\nvacation to the country where the property is located. \n\nExhibit 6, Schedule F of Bankruptcy Petition, dated November 12, 2003, at 13-15.\n16\nTr. 117; See Schedule I - Current Income of Individual Debtor(s), of Bankruptcy Petition, Ex. 6.\n17\nExhibit 6; Tr. 98.\n18\nInterrogatories, executed December 22, 2003, as listed in Exhibit 2 at 10.\n19\nTr. 116.\n20\nTr. 110.\n21\nTr. 119; Exhibit C, Agreement, at 4, Notice of Motion of Chapter 7 Trustee for Authorization to Sell Debtor\u2019s\n22\nInterest in Contract Free and Clear of Liens, Claims, Encumbrances and Interests, dated August 17 2005.\nId.\n23\nExhibit 2, Complaint, dated July 17, 2006.\n24\n4\nIn November 2003, Applicant  filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, listing $368,448 in liabilities,\nand $218,955 in assets. Approximately $124,000 of the liabilities constituted credit card debt.16\nThree months before filing for bankruptcy, Applicant had obtained a new job earning $10,000 per\nmonth. She did not report this income, as required, in the bankruptcy petition.  She also did not\n17\ndisclose the investment property, as required under Schedule A of the petition, the agreement for the\npurchase of the investment property, as required under Schedule G of the petition, the installment\npayments executed according to the terms of the investment agreement, as required under Schedule\nJ of the petition, or the refinance of their home in June 2003, as required under Schedule D of the\npetition.18\nOn December 22, 2003, Applicant and her husband completed interrogatories provided by\nthe Chapter 7 trustee. In response to question number 6, \u201cAre all of your assets identified in the\nschedules?\u201d they answered \u201cyes.\u201d19\nBy December of 2003, Applicant and her husband had deposited an additional $20,000\ntoward the execution of the agreement.   They generated this money through her employment\n20\nincome in addition to money borrowed from an insurance policy. Later that month, Applicant\nreceived $10,000 in gift money from relatives after the birth of their child. \u201cIt was funneled\u201d to their\nreal estate investment.  \n21\nBy February 2004, Applicant and her husband had paid approximately $38,000 of post-\npetition income toward the purchase of the investment property.  At no time did they make any\n22\npayments toward the satisfaction of any of the debts listed in the bankruptcy. In August 2005, the\ntrustee discovered the investment property, and sold it after obtaining authorization from the court.23\nIn July 2006, the trustee filed a complaint objecting to the discharge of Applicant and her husband\u2019s\ndebts, alleging \u201cconcealment of assets,\u201d and \u201cfalse oath or account.\u201d  The litigation is pending and\n24\nthe debts are still outstanding.\nPOLICIES\n\nSee generally, Directive, Sec. 2.3, Sec. 2.5.3, Sec. 3.2, and Sec. 4.2.\n25\n5\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be considered in\nthe evaluation of security suitability. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline,\nthe adjudicative guidelines are divided into those that may be considered in deciding whether to deny\nor revoke an individual\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information (disqualifying conditions)\nand those that may be considered in deciding whether to grant an individual\u2019s eligibility for access\nto classified information (mitigating conditions).\nBecause the entire process is a scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person\nconcept,\u201d all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and\nunfavorable, should be considered in making a meaningful decision. Specifically these are: (1) the\nnature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances; (2) the frequency and recency\nof the conduct; (3) the age of the applicant; (4) the motivation of the applicant, and the extent to\nwhich the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the\nconsequences; (5) the absence or presence of rehabilitation; and (6) the probability that the\ncircumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future.\nThe following adjudicative guidelines are raised:\nGuideline F - Financial Considerations: An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nGuideline E - Personal Conduct: Conduct involving questionable judgment,\nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, or unwillingness to comply with rules\nand regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified\ninformation.\nGuideline J - Criminal Conduct: A history or pattern of criminal activity creates\ndoubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.\nConditions pertaining to these adjudicative guidelines that could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security concerns, are set forth and discussed\nin the conclusions below.\nSince the protection of national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision\nin each case must be reached by applying the standard that the issuance of the clearance is \u201cclearly\nconsistent with the national interest.\u201d   In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those\n25\nconclusions that are based on the evidence contained in the record.\nThe Government is responsible for presenting evidence to establish facts in the SOR that\nhave been controverted. The applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain,\nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by the Government, and has the\nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\n\n6\nCONCLUSIONS\nFinancial Considerations and Personal Conduct\nApplicant accrued between $45,000 and $60,000 of debt in the 1990s that she was unable\nto satisfy after she lost her job in 2001, prompting her to file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2003. She\nfraudulently omitted several assets from the bankruptcy petition, including among other things, her\nlucrative job, her interest in an investment property, and multiple cash transactions executed to\npurchase an investment property. Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) 1 (A\nhistory of not meeting financial obligations), FC DC 2 (Deceptive or illegal financial practices such\nas embezzlement, employee theft, check fraud, income tax evasion, expense account fraud, filing\ndeceptive loan statements, and other intentional financial breaches of trust), and FC DC 3 (Inability\nor unwillingness to satisfy debts) apply. \nI have considered all the mitigating conditions and conclude none apply. Applicant lived a\nspendthrift, carefree lifestyle when she held a lucrative job in the 1990s, accruing up to $60,000 of\ndebts. She maintained this lifestyle after losing her job in 2001, going on a tropical vacation in\nOctober 2002, while still unemployed. Approximately 11 months later, she sought to facilitate the\npurchase of an investment property by obtaining a discharge of all of her debts through the Chapter\n7 bankruptcy process, while concealing both the purchase of the property and any assets associated\nwith its purchase from the bankruptcy trustee. Applicant has not mitigated the financial\nconsiderations security concern.\nApplicant\u2019s conduct also generates security concerns under Personal Conduct Disqualifying\nCondition (PC DC) 1 (Reliable, unfavorable information provided by associates, employers,\ncoworkers, neighbors, and other acquaintances), PC DC 4 (Personal conduct or concealment of\ninformation that increases an individual\u2019s vulnerability to coercion, exploitation or duress, such as\nengaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s personal, professional, or community\nstanding or render the person susceptible to blackmail), and PC DC 5 (A pattern of dishonesty or\nrule violations, including violation of any written or recorded agreement made between the\nindividual and the agency). The gross duplicity of Applicant\u2019s conduct completely undermines her\ncredibility. Consequently, upon considering all of the personal conduct mitigating conditions, I\nconclude none apply. She has not mitigated the personal conduct security concerns.\nCriminal Conduct\nThe SOR alleges civil infractions, not criminal. Absent the allegation of any criminal\ninfractions, there are no criminal conduct security concerns.\nWhole Person Concept\n\n7\nApplicant\u2019s pattern of duplicity began when she concealed the real estate investment and its\nmultiple related financial transactions from the bankruptcy court, continued when she made\ninstallment payments without notifying the bankruptcy court trustee, and did not end until nearly two\nyears later, when the trustee discovered the property, and initiated a forced sale. Throughout the\nhearing, she attempted to minimize responsibility for the fraud by asserting that her role was\nsecondary to her husband\u2019s role. Given her educational background, and the fact that she was the\nprimary wage earner throughout their marriage, this contention has little probative value.\nApplicant\u2019s contention that she currently manages money responsibly, and has not accrued\nany additional debt since filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2003, similarly has limited probative\nvalue. Her testimony simply was not credible in light of the scope of the duplicity.\nApplicant\u2019s investment in the real estate scheme was motivated by the admirable desire to\nachieve financial independence for her family. However, she resorted to duplicity in an attempt to\nachieve this objective. Upon considering this case in light of the whole person concept, I conclude\nthat Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns. Clearance is denied.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nParagraph 1 \u2013 Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2 - Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 3 - Guideline J:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

The second allegation is that On May 8, 1997, Applicant was convicted of transporting intoxicants (1.b.) in a motor vehicle as a minor.

MASON\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nGina L. Marine, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant\u2019s alcohol problem has not been mitigated due to his pattern of alcohol-related\nincidents, and his binge drinking to the point of impaired judgment. Though more than two years has\npassed since his most recent alcohol-related incident in December 2004, Applicant provided little\nor no evidence to show the measures taken to resolve his abusive use of alcohol. Application for a\npublic trust position is denied. \nSTATEMENT OF CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a\n\n. Although he cited 1999 and not 1998 as reflected in 1.c. of the SOR. . \n1\n2\nsecurity clearance for Applicant. On August 23, 2006, under Executive Order 10865 and Department\nof Defense Directive 5200.6, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the reasons for\nits security concerns raised under the alcohol consumption guideline (Guideline G) of the Directive.\nIn his answer dated August 30, 2006, Applicant requested a decision be made on the record in lieu\nof a hearing. A copy of the Government\u2019s File of Relevant Material (FORM, the Government\u2019s\nevidence in support of the SOR) was sent to Applicant on June 4, 2007. Applicant received the\nFORM on June 12, 2007. Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM, was received by DOHA on July 27,\n2007. The case was assigned to me for decision on August 13, 2007.\nRULINGS ON PROCEDURE\nAs noted in Statement of Case, the Government submitted the FORM to Applicant on June\n4, 2007. In section III of the FORM, the Government moved to amend the second and third lines of\nthe first paragraph of the SOR by deleting the following words \u201cparagraph 3-614, Department of\nDefense Regulation 5200.2-R and.\u201d The reason for this motion is that the cited regulation is\ninapplicable to trustworthiness cases. As stated in a memorandum by the Deputy Under Secretary\nof Defense on November 19, 2004, \u201cpursuant to paragraph 2.4 of DoD Directive 5220.6, DOHA\nshall utilize the provisions of the Directive to resolve contractor cases forwarded by the Defense\nSecurity Service (DSS) or Office of Personnel Management (OPM) for a trustworthiness\ndetermination, to include those involving ADP I, II, and III positions.\u201d Since the motion applies to\njurisdiction for DOHA to present this case, and neither diminishes nor encroaches upon the rights\nof the Applicant, the motion is granted under paragraph E3.1.17. of the Directive. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant is 29 years old and has been employed as a claims processor with a Department\nof Defense contractor since June 2004. He seeks a public trust position. \nApplicant admitted the four allegations listed under the alcohol consumption guideline of the\nSOR. See, Item 3. The first allegation is include consuming alcohol to the point of intoxication\nbetween 1997 and February 2005 (1.a.). The second allegation is that On May 8, 1997, Applicant\nwas convicted of transporting intoxicants (1.b.) in a motor vehicle as a minor. In May 1999,\nApplicant was charged with operating a motor vehicle under the influence (OWI) with his blood\nalcohol level over .10% (1.c.). On November 1, 2004, he disclosed the May 1998  OWI in response\n1\nto question 20 of his public trust application (PTA).\nOn February 10, 2005, Applicant provided an affidavit to an investigator from the Office of\nPersonnel Management (OPM) in which he furnished information about one of his alcohol-related\noffenses and a description of his drinking history. In December 2004, according to Applicant, he was\narrested and charged with OWI (1.d.), second offense, and also operating a motor vehicle with a\nprohibited blood alcohol level, second offense. Before he was arrested, Applicant was with a friend\nat a bar. After consuming about seven beers and two or three shots of alcohol over a five hour period,\nthey left the bar, and Applicant decided to drive his friend\u2019s car home. During the drive, Applicant\n\n3\ntried to activate the front light, high beams so he could improve his view of the road. His friend, who\nwas riding in the passenger seat, observed Applicant was having problems with the high beam lever,\nreached over and pulled the lever into the proper position. However, the friend\u2019s movement caused\nApplicant to swerve over the centerline of the road. After failing some field sobriety tests conducted\nby the arresting officer, Applicant was taken to jail. Applicant was sentenced to five days in jail,\nfined $935.00, his license was revoked for a year, and he was required to undergo an alcohol\nassessment. Applicant provided no information about the assessment. \nIn December 2004 when the alcohol-related incident occurred, Applicant was drinking from\nthree to ten beers at bars one or two times during the weekends. In February 2005, he claimed he\nreduced his consumption, drinking five beers between two and three times a month. Since the\nDecember 2004 OWI, Applicant has made certain that he always has a ride home so that he will not\ndrive after drinking alcohol. The last time Applicant was intoxicated was during a sports event in\nFebruary 2005. Applicant has never had counseling. He claims his alcohol consumption has never\naffected his employment. \nApplicant provided a statement and performance evaluations in response to the FORM. He\nadmitted making mistakes, but denied that he has ever been untrustworthy. Applicant is proud of his\nwork in processing claims for the military in an expeditious manner. Applicant\u2019s evaluation for the\nperiod ending in October 2004 indicates his performance was consistent with job requirements and\ngoals achieved. The October 2005 evaluation shows his performance either met or exceeded\nexpectations. Though the October 2006 assessment reiterated Applicant\u2019s 2005 evaluation, there was\nalso a notation that he had not met his attendance standard goal, and that future attendance\ndeficiencies could impact his rating in the next review period. \nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth guidelines containing disqualifying conditions (DC)\nand mitigating conditions (MC) that should be given binding consideration in making security\nclearance determinations. These conditions must be considered in every case along with the general\nfactors of the whole person concept. However, the conditions are not automatically determinative\nof the decision in any case nor can they supersede the Administrative Judge's reliance on his own\ncommon sense. \nBurden of Proof\nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, that conditions exist in the\npersonal or professional history of the applicant which disqualifies, or may disqualify, the applicant\nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484\nU.S. 518, 531 (1988) \u201c[T]he Directive presumes there is a nexus or rational connection between\nproven conduct under any of the Criteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.\u201d ISCR\nCase No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996) (quoting DISCR Case No. 92-1106 (App. Bd. Oct.\n7, 1993)). \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the\nburden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. \u201c[S]ecurity clearance\n\n4\ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d See Egan, 481 U.S. at 531; see\nDirective E2.2.2.\nAlcohol Consumption (AC)\nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment while\nraising the risk of security violations.\nCONCLUSIONS\nApplicant\u2019s alcohol-related conduct falls within FC disqualifying condition (DC)\nE2.A7,1.2.1. (alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence)\nThough he provided no details about his May 1997 conviction as a minor for transporting intoxicants\nin a motor vehicle, his admission of guilt to the charge raises a reasonable inference he was\nconsuming alcohol in a motor vehicle while underage. Had there been no subsequent alcohol-related\nbehavior after May 1997, his infraction before the age of majority could readily be attributed to a\nyouthful indiscretion. However, the alcohol-related behavior continued to May 1999 when Applicant\ncommitted his second alcohol-related offense. Less than six years later, Applicant\u2019s third alcohol-\nrelated offense occurred when he was arrested for his second OWI with his blood alcohol again\ngreater than .10%. The seven beers and two or three shots of whiskey coupled with the poor\njudgment demonstrated in driving his friend\u2019s car, provides ample reason for application of AC DC\nE2.A7.1.2.5. (habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment).\nThere are four mitigating conditions (MC) under the AC guideline that may be utilized by\nan applicant to meet his ultimate burden of persuasion in showing that he warrants a public trust\nposition. AC MC E2.A7.1.3.2. (the alcohol-related incidents do not indicate a pattern) does not\napply as three alcohol-related offenses between 1997 and December 2004 creates a pattern of\nalcohol-related behavior. AC MC E2.A7.1.3.2. (the problem occurred a number of years ago and\nthere is no indication of a recent problem) is removed from consideration as Applicant\u2019s most recent\nalcohol behavior occurred less than three years ago. \nE2.A7.1.3.3. (positive changes in behavior supportive of sobriety) provides an applicant an\nopportunity to explain in detail and show how he has modified his behavior to support sobriety or\ncontrol over alcohol use and inevitable alcohol-related incidents. Applicant provided no information\nin his response to the FORM about his current alcohol use. Very little favorable weight can be\nassigned to Applicant\u2019s February 2005 statement of reduced alcohol consumption because of his\noverall pattern of alcohol-related incidents, and the fact Applicant was still under the jurisdiction of\nthe court for his alcohol-related incident in December 2004. Notwithstanding the upcoming court\ndate in March 2005, Applicant became intoxicated in February 2005, a short time before he provided\nthe affidavit. \nApplicant\u2019s positive performance evaluations weigh in his favor, but provide little insight\ninto his record of alcohol-related incidents and excessive alcohol consumption. The performance\nnotations in his 2006 evaluation reveal an attendance problem that was so lacking that Applicant was\nwarned his future evaluations could be negatively affected. The lack of any evidence to explain the\n\n5\nscope and frequency of his current alcohol use indicates that AC MC E2.A7.1.3.3. has not been met.\nAC MC E2.A7.1.3.4. (following diagnosis of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence, the individual\nhas successfully completed inpatient or outpatient rehabilitation along with aftercare requirements,\nparticipates frequently in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or similar organization, has abstained\nfrom alcohol for a period of at least a year, and received a favorable prognosis by a credentialed\nmedical professional or licensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized\ntreatment program) is not applicable due to the absence of a diagnosis and no evidence of\ncounseling. Subparagraphs 1.a., 1.b., 1.c., and 1.d. are found against Applicant.\nMy findings against Applicant under the specific guidelines remain the same after an\nevaluation of the evidence under the whole person model. Applicant was only 19 when he committed\nhis first alcohol-related offense. By December 2004 (at age 26), he committed two additional\nalcohol-related offenses, with the last offense resulting in five days in jail, a hefty fine, and\nrevocation of his license for a year. With no evidence of counseling, Applicant has offered little to\nshow positive steps taken to avoid alcohol abuse or alcohol-related conduct in the future. His pattern\nof alcohol-related behavior is likely to continue in the future. I find against Applicant under the AC\nguideline. \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nParagraph 1(Alcohol Consumption, Guideline G):\nAGAINST THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.\nAgainst the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.b.\n.\nAgainst the Applicant. \nSubparagraph 1.c.\n.\nAgainst the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.d.\n.\nAgainst the Applicant.\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for assignment to sensitive duties.

Shortly afterwards, she was\nunemployed for almost 20 months, and she became financially responsible for her terminally ill\nmother and medically disabled son.  Nevertheless, she paid off a large debt reaffirmed after her\nbankruptcy, paid off her mother\u2019s medical expenses and her son\u2019s car loan, and resolved or disputed\nseveral other debts.  Trustworthiness concerns based on financial considerations are mitigated.\nEligibility for assignment to sensitive positions is granted.\n\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn August 17, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny Applicant a\nfavorable trustworthiness determination.  This action was taken under Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Jan. 2, 1992),\nas amended and modified (Directive), and Department of Defense Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel\nSecurity Program (Jan. 1987), as amended and modified (Regulation).  The SOR alleged security\nconcerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the Regulation. \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on September 26, 2006 and elected to have a hearing\nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on March 9, 2007, and heard on April\n18, 2007, as scheduled.  I kept the record open until May 3, 2007, to enable Applicant to submit\nadditional documentary evidence.  I received her evidence on May 3, 2007, and admitted it as\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit (AX) M.  DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on April 27, 2007.  \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant's admissions in her answer to the SOR and at the hearing are incorporated into my\nfindings of fact.  I make the following findings:\nApplicant is a 55-year-old administrative assistant employed by a defense contractor.  She\nis a high school graduate with some college credits but no degree.  She has worked for her current\nemployer since March 2004.  \nApplicant\u2019s annual performance appraisal for the period ending in March 2005 rated her\n\u201cexceptional\u201d for two performance objectives, \u201ccommendable\u201d for one, and  \u201csatisfactory\u201d for two.\nShe was selected as \u201c2  Quarter Employee of the Quarter\u201d in July 2005.  For the period ending in\nnd\nFebruary 2006, she was \u201cexceptional\u201d for two objectives, \u201ccommendable\u201d for two, and \u201csatisfactory\u201d\nfor one (Answer to SOR).  For the most recent period ending in February 2007, she was\n\u201cexceptional\u201d for one performance objective, \u201ccommendable\u201d for two, and \u201csatisfactory\u201d for two\n(AX J). \nApplicant served on active duty in the U.S. Air Force Reserve from September 1981 to\nJanuary 1982.  She received a security clearance during her military service (Government Exhibit\n(GX) 1 at 6; AX E).  \nApplicant was involved in a car accident in 1994 and unable to work for about six months.\nShe was involved in another accident in 1999 and unable to work for about three months.  Her\ninsurance payments and disability pay were less than her financial obligations, causing her to fall\nbehind on her car payment and several credit card balances (GX 2 at 2-3).\n\n4\nApplicant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in July 1999 and received a discharge in November\n1999.  She had about $33,222 in assets and $41,728 in liabilities, including credit card debts incurred\nduring a marriage that ended in divorce.  Her bankruptcy filing reflects 13 credit card accounts, of\nwhich five were joint and eight were in Applicant\u2019s name only (GX 4 at 37-41).  She reaffirmed a\n$16,709 debt for a 1998 automobile and the a $766 debt on two cemetery plots worth about $1,900.\nAll other debts were discharged.  This bankruptcy is alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a.\nShortly after Applicant\u2019s bankruptcy discharge, her mother became seriously ill and required\nfull-time care.  Applicant and her sister moved in with their mother to care for her.  Applicant lost\nher job in February 2001 and began living on her credit cards.  She also began paying her son\u2019s car\nloan when he was medically disabled from working (GX 2 at 4).  She was unemployed until\nDecember 2002.  At some time in 2002, she placed her mother in a nursing home, and assumed\nresponsibility for sharing the expenses with her sister.  The total bill for the nursing home was\naround $2,000 (Tr. 57).  Her mother died in May 2002 (Answer to SOR at 3).   \nApplicant has disputed the three medical bills alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, and 1.i, on the\nground that they should have been paid under her previous employer\u2019s medical insurance (AX A at\n17-18; Tr. 48-51).  She resolved the medical bill alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.j (AX A at 17; Tr. 48-49).  She\nresolved the credit card debt alleged twice in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g and 1.h (AX M at 7; Tr. 47).  She has\ndetermined that  the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e are the same debt, but she has been unable\nto resolve that debt and the credit card debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f, because the collection agencies will\nnot accept partial payments (Tr. 50, 52, 60).\nIn March 2005, Applicant executed a personal financial statement reflecting net monthly\nincome of $1,595, expenses of $1,265, debt payments of $492, and a monthly shortfall of about $162\n(GX 2 at 16).  She currently earns about $32,000 per year, about $5,200 more than when she\nexecuted her personal financial statement.  She lives with her sister and they split the rent of $895.\nShe has paid off her son\u2019s car and her own car loan that she reaffirmed after her bankruptcy.  She\nrecently borrowed about $3,500 for essential repairs on her car.  As of the date of the hearing, the\nbalance on this loan was about $3,200.  Applicant paid $150 on the nursing home bill in March\n2007, leaving a balance of only about $192.  Each month she has a remainder of about $260 before\nbuying food and gasoline (Tr. 55-58).  She has virtually no savings, but contributes about 3 percent\nof her pay to her retirement account (Tr. 59).  If she could negotiate a payment plan with her\nremaining two creditors, she estimates she would be able to pay about $50 a month (Tr. 60).\nApplicant  has inquired about consumer credit counseling through her employee\u2019s assistance\nprogram.  She recognizes she may need professional assistance to negotiate payments plans for her\ntwo unresolved debts, but she had not yet contacted anyone as of the date of the hearing (Tr. 60-61).\n\n5\nThe evidence regarding the debts alleged in the SOR is summarized in the table below.\nSOR\nDebt\nAmount\nStatus\nRecord\n1.b\nMedical\n$185\nDisputed\nGX 3 at 1; AX M; Tr. 51\n1.c\nMedical\n$266\nDisputed\nGX 3 at 1; AX A at 18;\nTr. 51\n1.d\nCredit card\n$2,697\nCharged off; same debt\nas SOR \u00b6 1.e\nGX 2 at 10; GX 3 at 2\n1.e\nCredit card\n$3,970\nCollection account\nopened Oct 2002, based\non same debt as SOR \u00b6\n1.d; attempting to\nnegotiate payment plan\nGX 3 at 2; Tr. 52\n1.f\nCredit card\n$9,010\nCollection account\nopened Nov 2002;\nattempting to negotiate\npayment plan\nGX 3 at 3; AX A at 3\n1.g\nCredit card\n$1,131\nResolved\nAX M at 7\n1.h\nCredit card\n$1,563\nSame debt as SOR \u00b6 1.g\nTr. 47\n1.i\nMedical\n$175\nDisputed\nAX A at 17; Tr. 48-49\n1.j\nMedical\n$359\nPaid\nGX 3 at 1; AX A at 17;\nTr. 49\nPOLICIES\nThe adjudicative guidelines set out in the Regulation are used to make ADP trustworthiness\ndeterminations.  Department of Defense contractor personnel are afforded the right to the procedures\ncontained in the Directive before any final unfavorable access determination may be made.\nRegulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.  \nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d  Regulation\n\u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.  \u201cThe standard that must be met for . . . assignment to sensitive\nduties is that, based on all available information, the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness\nare such that . . . assigning the person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of\nnational security.\u201d  Regulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1.  Appendix 8 of the Regulation sets forth personnel\nsecurity guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions under each\nguideline.  \n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is an acceptable security risk.\u201d  Regulation Appendix\n\n6\n8 at 132.  Each eligibility determination must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision based\non the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors listed\nin the Regulation.  An administrative judge should consider: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at\nthe time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the\npotential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence. Id.  \nIn security clearance cases, the government must initially present substantial evidence to\nestablish controverted facts in the SOR that disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being\neligible for access to classified information.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14.  \"Substantial evidence\" is \"more\nthan a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\"  See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36\nF.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).  Thereafter, the applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to\nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate\nburden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his\nsecurity clearance.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).  \u201cAny doubt as to\nwhether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved\nin favor of the national security.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E2.2.2.  These same burdens of proof apply to\ntrustworthiness determinations for ADP positions.\nCONCLUSIONS\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations)\nUnder this guideline, \u201c[a]n individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to\nengage in illegal acts to generate funds.\u201d  Regulation, Appendix 8 at 144.  A person who fails or\nrefuses to pay long-standing debts or is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible or careless\nin his or her duty to protect sensitive information.\nTwo disqualifying conditions (DC) under this guideline could raise a security concern and\nmay be disqualifying in this case.  DC 1 applies where an applicant has a history of not meeting his\nor her financial obligations. Id. DC 3 applies where an applicant has exhibited inability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts.  Id.  Both conditions are raised in this case.\nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise DC 1 and DC 3, the burden\nshifted to Applicant to produce evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  Id. An\napplicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it is never\nshifted to the government.  See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \nA security concern based on financial problems can be mitigated by showing the delinquent\ndebts were not recent (MC 1) or they were isolated incidents (MC 2).  Regulation, Appendix 8 at\n144.  Applicant had multiple delinquent debts, two of which are not yet resolved.  I conclude MC\n1 and MC 2 are not established.\n\n7\nSecurity concerns arising from financial problems can be mitigated by showing they are the\nresult of conditions \u201clargely beyond the person\u2019s control\u201d (MC 3).  Id.  Even if Applicant\u2019s financial\ndifficulties initially arose due to circumstances beyond her control, it is appropriate to consider\nwhether she acted in a reasonable manner when dealing with her financial difficulties.  ISCR Case\nNo. 02-02116 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 25, 2003).  \nApplicant has encountered numerous adverse conditions beyond her control, all of which\ncontributed substantially to her financial problems.  She was injured in two car accidents in 1994 and\n1999 and was unable to work.  She was divorced and faced with reduced income and jointly-incurred\ndebts.  She was unemployed from February 2001 until December 2002.  At the same time, she\nassumed responsibility for her mother\u2019s nursing home expenses.  Her son became medically\ndisabled, and she assumed responsibility for his car payments so that he could have transportation.\nShe reacted to these adversities by seeking gainful employment, living frugally, and attempting to\ncompromise or settle her debts.  I conclude MC 3 is established.\nA mitigating condition (MC 4) applies when an applicant \u201chas received or is receiving\ncounseling for the problem and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control.\u201d  Regulation, Appendix 8 at 144.  MC 4 is not established because Applicant had not\nyet sought financial counseling as of the date of the hearing.\nA security concern arising from financial problems can be mitigated by showing a good-faith\neffort to resolve debts (MC 6).  Id.  The concept of good faith \u201crequires a showing that a person acts\nin a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d  ISCR\nCase No. 99-0201, 1999 WL 1442346 at *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999).  \nApplicant has diligently tried to resolve the debts arising after her 1999 bankruptcy.  She paid\noff the car loan reaffirmed after her bankruptcy.  She assumed responsibility for her mother\u2019s\nmedical expenses, and she has paid off all but $192 of the nursing home bill.  She assumed\nresponsibility for her son\u2019s car payment after he was disabled, and she has paid off that debt.  She\nhas disputed three medical debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, and 1.i).  She resolved one credit card debt (SOR\n\u00b6\u00b6 1.g and 1.h) and one medical debt (SOR \u00b6 1.j).  She has repeatedly tried to reach a compromise\nwith the creditors in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.f.  Despite her limited income, she has made considerable\nprogress.  She has progressed in her job and received pay raises.  As a matter of law, she is not\nrequired to show she has paid every debt in its original full amount.  See ISCR Case No. 04-10671\nat 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2006).  I conclude MC 6 is established.\nWhole Person Analysis\nIn addition to considering the specific disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each\nguideline, I have also considered the general adjudicative guidelines in the Regulation.  I have\nconsidered: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding\nthe conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;\n(4) the applicant\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation;\n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the\nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9)\nthe likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  Regulation Appendix 8 at 132.\n\n8\nApplicant\u2019s financial problems have been serious and long-standing, but she has overcome\nmost of them.  She was very candid, sincere, and credible at the hearing.  She has lived frugally and\nresponsibly, but has been beset with repeated financial setbacks beyond her control.  She is a mature,\nresponsible woman who is well-regarded by her supervisors.  She is strong-willed and determined\nto resolve the two remaining debts.  Rehabilitation is not an issue because financial indiscipline has\nnot been the cause of her problems.  She has not succumbed to pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress since 1999, even though she has been struggling financially.  Her vulnerability to financial\npressure may soon be further reduced by the Florida statute of limitations, if it has not already run.\nSee Florida Statutes \u00a7 95.11 (five-year limitation for most contracts; four-year \u201ccatch-all\u201d limitation).\nWhile reliance on a statute of limitations is not necessarily a \u201cgood faith effort\u201d to resolve a debt,\nit is relevant because it makes the debt unenforceable, leaving a debtor no longer vulnerable to\ncoercion or temptation to engage in illegal conduct to generate funds.  See ISCR Case No. 99-9020\nat 6 n.12 (App. Bd. Jun. 4, 2001).  Applicant\u2019s financial track record strongly indicates she will\ncontinue to act responsibly.\nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating\nall the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the\ntrustworthiness concerns based on based on financial considerations.  Accordingly, I conclude she\nhas carried her burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security\nto grant her a favorable trustworthiness determination.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1. Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.j\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is clearly consistent with the interests of\nnational security to grant Applicant eligibility for assignment to sensitive duties.

SAX\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nRay T. Blank, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nThis 46-year-employee has a history of criminal conduct (1988-2004), drug involvement\n(1978-2004), and poor personal conduct, related to his falsifying his answer to a drug-related\nquestion in his 2004 Questionnaire for Positions of Trust.  No mitigation has been established as to\n\n2\nany concern.  A trustworthiness determination is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn August 31, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2,\n1992, as amended, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant.  The SOR detailed reasons\nwhy DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding required under the Directive that it\nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a trustworthiness determination\nfor the Applicant.  The SOR recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to conduct\nproceedings and determine whether a trustworthiness determination should be granted, denied or\nrevoked.\nOn October 3, 2006, and October 27, 2006, Applicant responded to the allegations set forth\nin the SOR, and elected to have a decision made by a DOHA Administrative Judge on the written\nrecord; i.e., without a hearing.  On February 27, Department Counsel issued a File of Relevant\nMaterial (FORM).  Applicant was instructed to submit any response within 30 days after receipt of\nthe FORM.  Any response was due by April 11, 2007, but none was received.  This matter was\nassigned to me on April 30, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant is a 46-year-old employee of a defense contractor.  The August 31, 2006 SOR\ncontains eleven (11) allegations under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct); four (4) allegations under\nGuideline H (Drugs); and one allegation under Guideline E (Personal Conduct).  Applicant admits\nall allegations under all three Guidelines.  All specific admissions are accepted and incorporated\nherein as Findings of Fact.  \nAfter considering the totality of the evidence, I make the following additional FINDINGS\nOF FACT as to the status of each SOR allegation.\nGuideline J (Criminal Conduct) \nApplicant was arrested on the following dates for the charges alleged:\n1.a.  May 28, 1988 - ten (10) counts of Fraudulent Check.  He was found guilty and fined\n$38.00.\n1.b.  September 12, 2002 - five (5) counts of Fraudulent Check. \n1c.

October 1, 2002  - Uttering a Fraudulent Check.  He was found guilty and fined $91.00.\n1.f.  October 7, 2002 - Fraudulent Check Uttered.  He was found guilty and fined $91.00.\n1.g. March 17, 2003 - Fraudulent Check Uttered.\n1.h. April 23, 2003 - five (5) counts of Uttering a Fraudulent Check.  He was found guilty\nand fined $66.00 on each count      \n1.i. July 22, 2003 - four (4) counts of Fraudulent Check.  He was found guilty and fined\n$93.00 on each count.  \n1.j. June 23, 2003  - ten (10) counts of Fraudulent Check.  \n1.k. the information set forth in paragraph 3, below, alleging a falsification on his\nQuestionnaire for Public Trust Position, which constitutes a violation of Title 10, Section 1001, of\nthe United States Code.\nGuideline H (Drugs)     \n  \n2.a.  Applicant used cocaine, with varying frequency, from approximately 1993 to at least\n2004.\n2.b.  Applicant used marijuana, with varying frequency, from approximately 1978 to at least\n2003.   \n2.c.  Applicant attended inpatient treatment at a Behavioral Heath Center in approximately\nJanuary 2003.  He was diagnosed with Polysubstance Abuse.  He used cocaine in 2004, after\ncompletion of this treatment.  \n2.d.  Applicant attended inpatient treatment at the same Center in approximately October\n2003. He was diagnosed with a relapse in cocaine and alcohol abuse and depression suicidal threats.\nHe was diagnosed with Polysubstance Abuse.  His prognosis for continued abstinence abuse from\ndrugs was \u201cpoor.\u201d  He used cocaine in 2004, after completion of this treatment.  \nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) \n3.a.  Applicant falsified material facts on his Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions (SF\n85P), executed by Applicant on August31, 2004, and reaffirmed on October 18, 2004, when in\nresponse to Question \u201c21 Illegal Drugs - In the last year [have you used] . . . , \u201c Applicant answered\n\u201cYes,\u201d but cited only a one-time use of marijuana in 2003, and omitted any mention of his cocaine\nuse, as cited in paragraph 2.a., above. \n\n4\nPOLICIES \nEach adjudicative decision must also include an assessment of nine generic factors relevant\nto the conduct, to include: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2)the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of\nthe conduct; (4) the ndividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral\nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence (Directive, on page 19 of Enclosure 2).\nI have considered all six factors, individually and collectively, in reaching my overall conclusion.\nThe eligibility criteria established by Executive Order 10865 and DoD Directive 5220.6\nidentify personal characteristics and conduct that are reasonably related to the ultimate question of\nwhether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d for an individual to hold a security\nclearance.  An applicant\u2019s admission of the information in specific allegations relieves the\nGovernment of having to prove those allegations.  If specific allegations and/or information are\ndenied or  otherwise controverted by the applicant, the Government has the initial burden of proving\nthose  controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons.  \nIf the Government meets its burden (either by the Applicant\u2019s admissions or by other\nevidence) and proves conduct that creates security  concerns under the Directive, the burden of\npersuasion then shifts to the Applicant to present  evidence in refutation, extenuation or mitigation\nsufficient to demonstrate that, despite the existence of conduct that falls within specific criteria in\nthe Directive, it is nevertheless consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue\na trustworthiness determination for the Applicant.\nA person seeking an ADP I, II, or III position enters into a fiduciary relationship with the\nGovernment based upon trust and confidence.  As required by DoD Directive 5220.6, as amended,\nat E2.2.2., \u201cany doubt as to whether access to classified [or ADP] information is clearly consistent\nwith the interests of national security will be resolved in favor of the nation\u2019s security.\u201d\nCONCLUSIONS \nApplicant is 46  years old.  In his response to the SOR, he admits all allegations except for\n1.k., which he neither admits or denies.  I find that 1.k. is independently established by the\nGovernment\u2019s evidence (Government\u2019s Exhibits (GX) 2, 3, 4, and 5).  None of  Applicant\u2019s answers\nare accompanied by any explanation in mitigation or extenuation.  In addition, he did not submit any\nresponse to the FORM.  The lack of any additional evidence and/or explanations means that the\nrecord consists entirely of the Government\u2019s exhibits, many of  which are documents submitted by\nApplicant himself during the trustworthiness investigation. \n   \nGuideline J (Criminal Conduct) \nThe record clearly establishes a pattern of issuing bad checks, specifically 39 fraudulent\nchecks on approximately 10 occasions between May 25, 1988 and June 23, 2003.  The FBI Criminal\nHistory Report (GX 5) cites only Fraudulent Check arrests in 1988 and twice in 2003.  Applicant\u2019s\n\n5\nSF 85P cites only \u201cbad checks\u201d in 2003 (GX 4).  Applicant\u2019s explanations for his bad checks appear\nonly in his sworn statement of April 2005 (GX 6).  He states that he began  \u201cmismanaging\u201d his\nmoney in 1998 because of his drug problem with cocaine (Id., at page 1).  He discusses his substance\nabuse treatment up through 2004, but since he used cocaine again in 2004, he cannot claim that the\ntreatment was demonstrably successful.  In addition, nothing he says comes close to mitigating the\nimpact of (1) his issuance of so many bad checks over a period that began in 1998 and continued\nuntil the recent past and 92) his 2004 falsification of his SF 85P.\nThe last allegation under Guideline J pertains to the falsification by Applicant of his answer\nto Question 21 on his 2004 SF 85P.  He admitted that his intentionally falsified his answer because\nhe did not \u201cwant to look bad\u201d (GX 6).  This is not an acceptable excuse.  \nDisqualifying/Mitigating Conditions (DC) \nDC (a) (a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses) and DC \u00a9 allegations or\nadmissions of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally\nprosecuted, or convicted) apply, but none of the parallel mitigating conditions are shown by the\nrecord. \nI conclude that Applicant\u2019s history of bad checks (1998-July 2003) and his intentional\nfalsification in 2004 show that he lacks the good judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness required\nof anyone seeking access to ADP information.  \nGuideline H (Drugs)\nThe record clearly shows a 26-year history of drug use (cocaine and marijuana) that began\nin 1978, when Applicant was about 17, and continued until at least 2003 for marijuana and 2004 for\ncocaine.  His drug use continued until just eight or so months before he completed his SF 85P.\nUnder these circumstances. His drug use is considered to be still recent.  The poor prognosis on his\nsubstance abuse treatment reports does not allow any level of confidence that Applicant will be able\nto refrain from his old habits.\nDisqualifying/Mitigating Conditions\nDC (a) (any drug abuse), DC \u00a9 illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing,\nmanufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia, and DC (f) failure\nto successfully complete a drug treatment program prescribed by a duly qualified medical\nprofessional, are all applicable, but no parallel mitigating conditions are shown by the record.\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct)\nAs discussed above, Applicant\u2019s falsification of his answer to Question 25 on his 2004 SF\n85P was both deliberate and done with the intent to deceive the Department of Defense.  \nDisqualifying/Mitigating Conditions.  \nDC (a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of material facts from any\n\n6\npersonnel; security questionnaire, . . . . or [to] award fiduciary responsibilities and DC \u00a9 credible\nadverse information which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole person analysis of\nquestionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply\nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not properly\nsafeguard protected information, are applicable.  No parallel mitigating circumstances are established\nby the record. \nTaken separately and as a whole, the evidence compels the conclusion that Applicant has not\ndemonstrated that he currently possesses the judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness required of\nanyone seeking access to classified information and material.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings as required by Section 3, Paragraph 7 of Enclosure 1 of the Directive are\nhereby rendered as follows:\nGuideline J (Criminal Conduct) \n \nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph  l.a.           \nAgainst the Applicant\n                \nSubparagraph 1.b.               \nAgainst the Applicant\n            \nSubparagraph 1.c.           \nAgainst the Applicant\n           \nSubparagraph 1.d.            \nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph  l.e.           \nAgainst the Applicant\n                \nSubparagraph 1.f.               \nAgainst the Applicant\n            \nSubparagraph l.g.           \nAgainst the Applicant\n                \nSubparagraph 1.h.               \nAgainst the Applicant\n            \nSubparagraph 1.i.           \nAgainst the Applicant\n           \nSubparagraph 1.j.               \nAgainst the Applicant\n            \nSubparagraph 1.k.           \nAgainst the Applicant\n           \nGuideline H (Drugs)\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.a.           \nAgainst the Applicant\n                \nSubparagraph 2.b.               \nAgainst the Applicant\n            \nSubparagraph 2.c.           \nAgainst the Applicant\n           \nSubparagraph 2.d.            \nAgainst the Applicant\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct)\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.a.           \nAgainst the Applicant\n                \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a trustworthiness determination for Applicant.\nBARRY M.

Additionally,\nApplicant\u2019s credibility is suspect since he knew or should have known that the information that he\nprovided to the Government in a Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions (QPTP) on August 24,\n2004, regarding his indebtedness, was materially incorrect and incomplete. Mitigation has not been\nshown. Applicant\u2019s eligibility for assignment to a sensitive position is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn August 31, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 (as amended) and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated\nJanuary 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why\nDOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that Applicant is\neligible for assignment to a sensitive position and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge\nto make a determination on this issue.\nIn a signed and sworn statement, notarized on September 20, 2006, Applicant responded to\nthe SOR allegations (RSOR)and requested a hearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.\nOn December 15, 2006, this case was assigned to another Administrative Judge to conduct\na hearing and issue a written decision, but it was reassigned to this Administrative Judge on March\n28, 2007. A Notice of Hearing was issued to the parties on May 29, 2007, and the hearing was\nconducted on June 12, 2007. \nAt the hearing, Department Counsel offered 11 documentary exhibits (Exhibits 1 through 11)\nand no witnesses were called. Applicant offered no documentary exhibits at the hearing but offered\nhis own testimony. The transcript (Tr) was received on June 21, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nIn the SOR, the Government alleges concern under Adjudicative Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the Directive. The SOR contains 11\nallegations, 1.a., through 1.k., under Guideline F, one allegation, 2.a., under Guideline E, and one\nallegation, 3.a., under Guideline J. In his RSOR, Applicant admitted SOR allegations 1.a., through\n1.k., and 2.a., and denied 3.a. The admitted allegations are incorporated herein as findings of fact.\nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including Applicant's\nRSOR, the admitted documents, and the live testimony, and upon due consideration of that evidence,\nI make the following additional findings of fact: \nApplicant is 38 years old. He is unmarried, but separated, and he has two sons.  Applicant\nis an employee of a defense contractor, and he seeks assignment to sensitive duties.\n\n3\nParagraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations)\nThe SOR lists 11 allegations of overdue debts, 1.a. through 1.k, under Adjudicative Guideline\nF totaling approximately $8,000. As stated above, Applicant\u2019s has admitted each allegation under\nGuideline F. No independent evidence has been introduced to indicate that any of these debts has\nbeen resolved or even reduced. The debts will be listed in the same order as they were in the SOR:\n1.a. This overdue debt to Creditor 1 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $1,834.\n1.b. This overdue debt to Creditor 2 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $237.\n1.c. This overdue debt to Creditor 3 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $417.21.\n1.d. This overdue debt to Creditor 4 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $279.79.\n1.e. This overdue debt to Creditor 5 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $1,069.\n1.f. This overdue debt to Creditor 6 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $167.\n1.g. This overdue debt to Creditor 7 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $149.\n1.h. This overdue debt to Creditor 8 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $2,223.\n1.i. This overdue debt to Creditor 9 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $450.\n1.j. This overdue debt to Creditor 10 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $846.21.\n1.k. This overdue debt to Creditor 11 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $377.\nIn a signed, letter signed on July 26, 2006, (Exhibit 2) which accompanied his Responses to\nInterrogatories (Exhibit 3) Applicant  averred that he and his wife had \u201cdecided to file for bankruptcy\nwithin the next month to start over financially.\u201d He added that he is \u201csubmitting this letter as proof\nthat I am taking action in order to resolve these credit issues.\u201d Yet at the time of the hearing he had\nstill taken no action to resolve these debts. While he tried to he explain, that the reason he failed to\ntake the affirmative action to resolve his debts as he described in his letter, was because he and his\nwife had separated,  he did concede that they had separated in January of 2007, and he could give\nno explanation for his failing to take action from July through December of 2006.\nParagraph 2 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct) \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because\nwhen he completed a signed, sworn QPTP on August 24, 2004, he furnished untruthful information\nto the Government (Exhibit 1). \nQuestion #20 asks,  \u201cAre you now over 180 days delinquent on any loan or financial\n\n4\nobligation? (Include loans or obligations funded or guaranteed by the Federal Government.)\u201d\nApplicant answered \u201cNo\u201d to this question. At the time he completed the QPTP, Applicant had been\nover 180 days delinquent on all of the debts listed above as 1.a. through 1.k.\nIn his testimony, Applicant claimed that he did not knowingly mislead the Government in\nthe information that he furnished on his QPTP.   He claimed that he did not read the question\ncompletely, and he stopped reading after he read the word \u201cloan\u201d and since he had no overdue loans,\nhe answered \u201cNo.\u201d\nParagraph 3 (Guideline J - Criminal Conduct) \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because\nhe has engaged in criminal conduct. Applicant's conduct involved furnishing information to the\nGovernment in the form of a written, signed, completed questionnaire that was less than complete\nand truthful, as alleged in the SOR as 3.a. These misrepresentations are a violation of Federal Law,\nTitle 18, United States Code Section 1001, a felony. \nPOLICIES\nThe President has \"the authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national\nsecurity and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . .\nthat will give that person access to such information.\" Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 527 (1988). In Executive Order 12968, Access to Classified Information, \u00a7 3.1(b) (August 4,\n1995), the President provided that eligibility for access to classified information shall be granted only\nto United States citizens \"whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to\nthe United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, reliability, discretion, and sound\njudgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness\nand ability to abide by regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified\ninformation.\" \nTo be eligible for assignment to sensitive duties, an applicant must meet the security\nguidelines contained in DoD 5200.2-R. \"The standard that must be met for . . . assignment to\nsensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the person's loyalty, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with\nthe interests of national security.\" DoD 5200.2-R, \u00b6 C6.1.1.1. Appendix 8 of the Regulation sets forth\npersonnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions under\neach guideline.\nAs set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17, \"In evaluating the relevance of\nan individual's conduct, the [Administrative Judge] should consider the following factors [General\nFactors]:\na. The nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct\nb. The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation\nc. The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd. The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne. The voluntariness of participation\n\n5\nf. The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes\ng. The motivation for the conduct\nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\ni. The likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe eligibility guidelines established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics\nand conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question of whether it is \"clearly consistent\nwith the national interest\" to grant an Applicant's request for access to classified information.\nIn the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian\nworkers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information twenty-four hours a day.\nThe Government is therefore appropriately concerned where available information indicates that an\nApplicant for clearance may be involved in acts of alcohol abuse and criminal conduct that\ndemonstrates poor judgement, untrustworthiness or unreliability on the Applicant's part.\nThe DoD Directive states, \"Each adjudication is to be an overall common sense\ndetermination based upon consideration and assessment of all available information, both favorable\nand unfavorable, with particular emphasis placed on the seriousness, recency, frequency, and\nmotivation for the individual's conduct; the extent to which conduct was negligent, willful,\nvoluntary, or undertaken with the knowledge of the circumstances or consequences involved; and,\nto the extent that it can be estimated, the probability that conduct will or will not continue in the\nfuture.\" \nThe Administrative Judge can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have a\nreasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record. The Judge cannot draw inferences or\nconclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature. Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \"Any determination under this order...shall be\na determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the\nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\"\nCONCLUSIONS\nHaving considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal precepts and\nfactors, I conclude the following with respect to Guidelines F, E, and J: \n(Guideline F - Financial Considerations)\nThe Government has established its case under Guideline F. The record evidence clearly\nestablishes Applicant's long history of indebtedness, and there is no evidence that Applicant has\nresolved these overdue debts.\nApplicant's overall conduct pertaining to his financial obligations falls within Financial\nConsiderations Disqualifying Condition (DC) (E2.A6.1.2.1.), and DC (E2.A6.1.2.3.), a history of\nnot meeting financial obligations, and an inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts. I find that no\n\n6\nMitigating Condition (MC) is applicable to this case. \nUntil Applicant makes a good-faith effort to resolve his debts, and he can establish a record\nof financial responsibility and stability, concerns will continue to exist under Guideline F. I resolve\nGuideline F against Applicant.\n(Guideline E -Personal Conduct) \nWith respect to Guideline E, Applicant provided false material information to the\nGovernment in response to a question  on the QPTP that he signed on August 24, 2004. While some\nquestions on the QPTP may be somewhat ambiguous, Question #20 is straightforward and in plain\nEnglish. I do not find it credible that he could have misread or misinterpreted this question.\nApplicant knew or should have known that he should have answered \u201cYes\u201d to this question and\nincluded all of these debts that were more than 180 days overdue, which were 1.a. through 1.k,\nabove.\nIn reviewing the DCs under Guideline E,  I conclude that DC E2.A5.1.2.2. applies because\nthe information that Applicant provided in his QPTP was known or should have been known by him\nto be omissions and concealment of relevant and material facts.  No MCs apply.\nIn this case, Applicant failed to offer any independent evidence indicating that he has\nreformed and is now reliable and trustworthy. This precludes a finding that it is now clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant him access to sensitive information. I resolve Guideline\nE against Applicant.\n(Guideline J -Criminal Conduct) \nThe Government also established by substantial evidence that Applicant engaged in criminal\nconduct, as he furnished information to the Government that was not complete and truthful, which\nis a violation of Federal Law, Title 18, United States Code Section 1001. \nDC (E2.A10.1.2.1.), allegations or admissions of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the\nperson was formally charged, and DC (E2.A10.1.2.2), a single serious crime or multiple lesser\noffenses, apply in this case.  Applicant has not mitigated this allegation. Paragraph 3 is found against\nApplicant. \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nParagraph 1. Guideline F: AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.: Against Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.: Against  Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c.: Against  Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d.: Against  Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e.: Against  Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f.: Against   Applicant \n\n7\nSubparagraph 1.g.: Against Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h.: Against Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i.: Against Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j.: Against Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k.: Against Applicant\nParagraph 2. Guideline E: AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a.: Against Applicant\nParagraph 3. Guideline J: AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a.: Against Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for assignment to sensitive\nduties.\nMartin H.

On December 28, 2006, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant\nof the basis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On August 6, 2007, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Michael H. Leonard\ndenied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred by failing to admit\nand consider Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A and B; whether the Judge erred by concluding that the security\nconcerns raised under Guideline J had not been mitigated.\nApplicant argues that the Judge erred by failing to admit and consider Applicant\u2019s Exhibits\nA and B.  The Board does not find this argument persuasive.\nThere is a rebuttable presumption that the Judge considered all the record evidence unless\nhe specifically states otherwise. See, e.g., DOHA Case No. 96-0228 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 3, 1997).\nThe Judge is not required to cite or discuss every piece of record evidence.  See, e.g., DISCR Case\nNo. 90-1596 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 18, 1992).  A review of the record indicates that the Judge received\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits A and B for identification during the hearing, but withheld ruling on their\nadmissibility until Department Counsel had an opportunity to examine them and make any\nobjections.   On June 29, 2007, Department Counsel filed a written Response to Applicant\u2019s\n1\nSubmission of Exhibits A and B which stated that she had no objection to their admission into\nevidence.  In his Decision, the Judge explicitly referenced Exhibit A twice.   Based on the foregoing,\n2\nthe Board concludes that the Judge received and considered Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A and B, and\nApplicant\u2019s argument to the contrary is without merit.\nApplicant also argues that the Judge erred in concluding that the security concerns raised\nunder Guideline J had not been mitigated, because the criminal conduct is not recent, not likely to\nrecur, and there is clear evidence of rehabilitation.  Applicant\u2019s argument does not demonstrate that\nthe Judge erred.\nOnce there has been a concern articulated regarding an applicant\u2019s security clearance\neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance. See\nDorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  After\nth\nthe government presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to\nestablish mitigation.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  \u201cThe application of disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions and whole person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply\nto the particular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires the exercise of sound discretion\nin light of the record evidence as a whole.\u201d  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-10950 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul.\n25, 2007).  \u201cThus, the presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to\nmake a favorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the\nevidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence,\nor vice versa.\u201d See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-11134 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 16, 2007).  \u201cAn applicant\u2019s\n\n3\ndisagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different\ninterpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or\nreached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\u201d  See, e.g., ISCR\nCase No. 05-07183 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 26, 2007).\nThe Applicant has not met his burden of demonstrating that the Judge erred in concluding\nthat the criminal conduct allegations had not been mitigated.  Although Applicant strongly disagrees\nwith the Judge\u2019s conclusions, he has not established that those conclusions are arbitrary, capricious,\nor contrary to law.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.3.\nIn this case the Judge made sustainable findings that Applicant had been arrested on four\noccasions between 2000 and 2006, had three misdemeanor convictions, and was on probation until\nApril 2009.  The Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the recency\nand seriousness of the disqualifying conduct, and reasonably explained why the evidence which the\nApplicant had presented in mitigation was insufficient to overcome the government\u2019s security\nconcerns.  The Board does not review a case de novo.  The favorable record evidence cited by\nApplicant is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary\nto law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-28041 at 4 (App. Bd. Jun. 29, 2005).  Given the record that was\nbefore him, the Judge\u2019s ultimate unfavorable security clearance decision under Guideline J is\nsustainable.\nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge denying Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Michael Y.

LEONARD\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nStephanie C. Hess, Esq. , Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\n\n Executive Order 10865, dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive 5220.6, dated January 2,\n1\n1992, as amended (Directive).\n See Memorandum from the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, dated August 30, 2006, Subject:\n2\nImplementation of Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (December\n29, 2005). \n2\nApplicant has a history of criminal conduct involving his current wife, who is deeply\ntroubled. He was arrested on four occasions in 2000, 2004, and 2006, and he has three misdemeanor\nconvictions. He is on probation until April 2009. The potential for exploitation and for recurrence\nof similar conduct cannot be ruled out. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied.\n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny or revoke his eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance. Acting under the relevant authority,  the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n1\n(DOHA) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant on December 28, 2006. The SOR\u2014which\nis equivalent to an administrative complaint\u2014details the factual basis for the action and alleges a\nsecurity concern under Guideline J for criminal conduct.  \nIn addition to the Directive, this case is brought under the revised Adjudicative Guidelines\nfor Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (Revised Guidelines) approved by\nthe President on December 29, 2005. The Revised Guidelines were then modified by the Defense\nDepartment, effective September 1, 2006. They supersede or replace the guidelines published in\nEnclosure 2 to the Directive. They apply to all adjudications and other determinations where an SOR\nhas been issued on September 1, 2006, or thereafter.  The Directive is pending formal amendment.\n2\nThe Revised Guidelines apply to this case because the SOR is dated December 28, 2006, which is\nafter the effective date. \n \nApplicant replied to the SOR on February 8, 2007, and requested a hearing. In his reply to\nthe SOR, he admitted the factual allegations in subparagraphs 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, and 1.d. The case was\nheard on June 19, 2007. DOHA received the hearing transcript on June 27, 2007.\nIn general terms, the major issue is as follows: Is it clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance given his history of four\narrests, three misdemeanor convictions, and current sentence to probation until April 2009?  \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nBased on the record evidence as a whole, the following facts are established. \n\n3\n1.\nApplicant, a 51-year-old man, works as a production control supervisor for an aerospace and\ndefense company where he supervises 17 employees. He has worked for this company since\nNovember 1979. His annual salary is about $85,000. He is seeking to retain a security clearance\npreviously granted to him by the Defense Department.  \n2.\nHe married his first wife in 1975. The marriage ended in divorce in 1998. Applicant and his\nfirst wife had one child, a daughter, who is now 13 years old and lives with her mother. Applicant\nhas visitation rights and he has regular contact with his daughter. He is also required to make child\nsupport payments, which are in good standing. There were never any incidents of family violence\nduring Applicant\u2019s first marriage. At no time were the police called to intervene between Applicant\nand his first wife.\n3.\nApplicant has a history of criminal conduct involving his current wife, who is deeply\ntroubled. He was arrested on four occasions in 2000, 2004, and 2006, and he has three misdemeanor\nconvictions. He is on probation until April 2009. The circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s\nsituation are described below.\n4.\nApplicant married his current wife in 2004, although they have lived together since sometime\nin 2000. She is now 37 years old. The first incident of criminal conduct was in December 2000.\nApplicant was arrested and charged with family violence battery, and battery and simple battery. The\ncharges surfaced after his current wife went to the hospital and alleged Applicant attacked her.\nApplicant denies doing so. He appeared in court, without counsel, and elected to dispose of the\ncharges via a first-offender program. He completed anger-management counseling in the program.\nUpon completion, the charges against him were nolle prossed. \n5.\nHe was arrested a second time in May 2004. He was charged with family violence battery,\nbattery and simple assault, disorderly conduct, and cruelty to children. Applicant was arrested after\nhis current wife\u2019s ex-husband reported allegations to the police. Applicant denies any wrongdoing.\nWith the assistance of counsel, Applicant agreed to a negotiated plea agreement wherein he pleaded\nguilty to disorderly conduct and the other charges were dismissed. As a result, he served probation,\npaid a fine, and went to several weeks of counseling.\n6.\nHe was arrested for the third and fourth time in April 2006. On about April 3 , he was\nrd\narrested and charged with aggravated assault, two counts of family violence battery, and possession\nof methamphetamine. He was arrested after his current wife\u2019s sister reported allegations to the\npolice. Applicant denies any wrongdoing. On about  April 10 , he was arrested and charged with\nth\nstalking aggravated. The basis for this charge was an alleged violation of a no-contact order after he\nwas bonded out of jail on the April 3  arrest. In particular, Applicant met with his wife on April 10\nrd\nth\nfor her to sign an affidavit in which she exonerated Applicant from any wrongdoing for the April 3rd\ncharges. In the affidavit (Exhibit 9), his wife explained that she has been diagnosed with bipolar\ndisorder and schizophrenia. She had been committed for residential treatment three times in the past\n12 months. Applicant assists her in administering her prescribed medications because she cannot\nmanage on her own. \n7.\nApplicant escorted his wife to a notary to sign the affidavit. After she signed it, Applicant\ndropped the affidavit off at his lawyer\u2019s office. Applicant believed his lawyer would take the\naffidavit and get the court to change the no-contact order to a no-violent-contact order. On that basis,\n\n Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a\n3\nsecurity clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10  Cir. 2002) (\u201cIt is likewise plain that there\nth\nis no \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance, so that full-scale due process standards do not apply to cases such as Duane\u2019s.\u201d).\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 2. \n4\n4\nApplicant returned home where he was arrested that night shortly after he and his wife had gone to\nbed. The April 10  arrest took place after his wife\u2019s sister called the police. \nth\n8.\nOn April 18, 2006, his wife was deposed by Applicant\u2019s lawyer (Exhibit 6). In the deposition,\nshe further exonerated Applicant from any wrongdoing on April 3  and denied Applicant had\nrd\nharassed and intimated her into signing the affidavit. Also, she claimed her sister has a history of\ndrug-related criminal conduct and of making false claims against people, and she assumed the\nmethamphetamine found on Applicant\u2019s property belonged to her sister. She also wanted the no-\ncontact order changed so Applicant could return home and assist her with her medications. \n9.\nThe charges were adjudicated on about April 30, 2007, when Applicant agreed to a\nnegotiated guilty plea (Exhibit A). For the initial charges, he pleaded guilty to simple battery instead\nof one charge of family violence battery. The remaining charges against Applicant were nolle\nprossed. The court sentenced him to a misdemeanor sentence of 12 months confinement to be served\non probation. For the stalking charge, he pleaded guilty to simple assault. The court sentenced him\nto a misdemeanor sentence of 12 months confinement to be served on probation. The court further\nordered that the sentence was consecutive with the other sentence. As a result, Applicant is on\nprobation until April 30, 2009. \n10.\nApplicant underwent an evaluation for alcohol and chemical dependency in June 2007\n(Exhibit A). The evaluation was favorable and concluded that Applicant did not have a need for\ntreatment for alcohol or drug use or abuse. The evaluation recommended Applicant continue to\nabstain from alcohol and any drug not lawfully prescribed and that random testing for alcohol and\ndrugs should take place during his probation. \n11.\nApplicant describes his second marriage as \u201ctotally insane\u201d (R. 114). He married so she\nwould be covered by his health insurance, because she had neglected her health over the years and\nwas in need of medical care. He agreed that his marriage was such that he could be arrested at\nanytime (R. 116\u2013118). Indeed, since the last charges were disposed of on April 30, 2007, she has\nmade threats to call the police on nearly a daily basis (R. 108\u2013109). Also, he has some concern that\nshe could make a false claim against him to obtain leverage (R. 119). He recently initiated divorce\nproceedings. She has not yet responded to the divorce petition, but he hopes the proceeding will be\nuncontested. He is concerned, however, that she will contest the divorce and drag out the process.\nCurrently, he lives alone in a garage apartment detached from the house, where she resides. \nGENERAL PRINCIPLES OF LAW AND POLICIES\nNo one has a right to a security clearance.  The President authorized the Secretary of Defense\n3\nor designee to grant applicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding\nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  As noted by the Supreme Court in\n4\n\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.\n5\n ISCR Case No. 96-0277 (App. Bd. Jul. 11, 1997).\n6\n ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004).\n7\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n8\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n9\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n10\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n11\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n12\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n13\n5\nDepartment of Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance\ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  Under Egan, Executive Order\n5\n10865, and the Directive, any doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of protecting national security.\nThe agency appellate authority has made it clear that the only purpose of a security clearance\ndecision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security\nclearance for an applicant.  There is no presumption in favor of granting or continuing access to\n6\nclassified information.  The government has the burden of presenting evidence to establish facts\n7\nalleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An applicant is responsible for presenting evidence\n8\nto refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an\n9\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan,\n10\nthe Supreme Court said that the burden of proof in a security clearance case is less than the\npreponderance of the evidence.  The agency appellate authority has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning,\n11\nand a judge\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.12\nThe Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a\nperson\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating\nconditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial\ncommonsense decision based upon consideration of all the relevant and material information, the\npertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-person concept. A person granted access\nto classified information enters into a special relationship with the government. The government\nmust be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in those persons to whom it grants access\nto classified information. The decision to deny a person a security clearance is not a determination\nof an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination that the applicant has not met the strict\n13\nguidelines the President has established for granting eligibility for a security clearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n Revised Guidelines at 21\u201322 (setting forth the disqualifying and mitigating conditions). \n14\n DC 1 is \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses.\u201d\n15\n DC 4 is \u201cindividual is currently on parole or probation.\u201d \n16\n See ISCR Case No. 98-0247 (App. Bd. Jan. 20, 1999) (\u201cprobationary status is a circumstance that cannot be\n17\noverlooked in assessing an applicant\u2019s suitability to hold a clearance\u201d). \n MC 3 is \u201cevidence that the person did not commit the offense.\u201d  \n18\n6\nUnder Guideline J,  a security concern typically exists because criminal activity creates\n14\ndoubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. It calls into question a person\u2019s\nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nThe government contends Applicant\u2019s history of criminal conduct raises a security concern\nunder Guideline J. Applicant does not dispute his arrests and convictions. But he contends that the\nallegations against him are false and that his wife\u2019s condition makes her unstable and likely to invent\ncomplaints against him, and he is taking action to divorce her, which should end the problems. The\nquestion is whether Applicant\u2019s history of four arrests, three misdemeanor convictions, and current\nsentence to probation until April 2009 is consistent with eligibility for access to classified\ninformation under the clearly-consistent standard. \nThe record evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of criminal conduct\nwith his current wife. Although he denies wrongdoing, he pleaded guilty to three misdemeanor\noffenses. He did so with the assistance of counsel. His four arrests, three misdemeanor convictions,\nand current sentence to probation until April 2009 raise a security concern under Guideline J because\ntwo DC apply against Applicant. First, DC 1  applies because his three misdemeanor convictions\n15\nconstitute multiple lesser offenses. Second, DC 4  applies because Applicant is serving probation\n16\nuntil April 2009. His history of criminal conduct creates doubt about his judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness. Indeed, his probationary status is a circumstance that cannot be overlooked.  \n17\nOne of the mitigating conditions under Guideline J applies in Applicant\u2019s favor. MC 318\napplies because there is some evidence suggesting Applicant did not commit the offenses. This is\nespecially so with the April 2006 charges because his wife provided information exonerating him\nfrom any wrongdoing.  \nIn addition, Applicant receives credit under the whole-person concept. He has worked for the\nsame company since 1979. He has enjoyed a successful career, judging by his position, supervisory\nauthority, and annual salary. Unlike the current situation, his first marriage did not have similar\nproblems. And he and his first wife have acted like mature adults in raising their daughter. His\ncurrent wife appears to be a deeply troubled person with mental-health problems and substance-\nabuse issues. It is likely that her troubles are a major contributing factor to Applicant\u2019s arrests and\nconvictions. All these circumstances weigh in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nThree other matters deserve consideration under the whole-person concept. First, the\nlikelihood of recurrence of similar conduct with his current wife is high because Applicant candidly\n\n Revised Guidelines at 2 (\u201cthe likelihood of continuance or recurrence\u201d). \n19\n Revised Guidelines at 2 (\u201cthe potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress\u201d). \n20\n Revised Guidelines at 2 (\u201cThe ultimate determination . . . must be an overall commonsense judgment . . .\u201d).\n21\n7\nacknowledged that he could be arrested at anytime.  And it is simply too soon to tell if a divorce will\n19\nterminate Applicant\u2019s problems with his current wife. Second, Applicant has some concern that his\nwife could make a false claim against him to obtain leverage. This situation creates the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress.  Third, the current state of Applicant\u2019s marriage is, at\n20\nbest, unstable. It is also a reminder of the commonsense understanding that individuals in the middle\nof great emotions are not safe risks.  On balance, the whole-person analysis weighs against\n21\nApplicant.  \nApplicant\u2019s history of four arrests, three misdemeanor convictions, and current sentence to\nprobation until April 2009 outweighs the favorable evidence. In reaching this conclusion, his\nprobationary status is a circumstance that received substantial weight, because it is too soon to tell\nif he will complete his sentence to probation without violation. Based on the record evidence as a\nwhole, Applicant did not rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the criminal conduct security concern.\nApplicant did not meet his ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nSOR \u00b6 1\u2013Guideline J:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs a\u2013d:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the facts and circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

In\nFebruary 2006, Applicant was interviewed by an Office of Personnel Management (OPM)\ninvestigator. On two occasions during the early part of the interview, Applicant replied that he had\ncommitted no alcohol or drug-related offenses. Only after additional questioning did he finally\nacknowledge his alcohol-related offense in April 2001. Applicant\u2019s favorable character evidence\ndoes not mitigate the criminal and personal conduct. Clearance is denied. \nSTATEMENT OF CASE \nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for Applicant. On July 30, 2006, under Executive Order 10865 and Department\nof Defense Directive 5200.6, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the reasons for\nits security concerns raised under the criminal conduct guideline (Guideline J), and the personal\nconduct guideline (Guideline E) of the Directive. In his answer dated August 3, 2006, Applicant\nrequested a decision be made on the record in lieu of a hearing. \nA copy of the Government\u2019s File of Relevant Material (FORM, the Government\u2019s evidence\nin support of the SOR) was sent to Applicant on February 26, 2007. Applicant received the FORM\non March 5, 2007. Applicant submitted a timely response on March 19, 2007. The case was assigned\nto me for decision on April 25, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe SOR alleges criminal conduct and personal conduct. Applicant admitted the factual\nallegations with explanations. In response to subparagraph 1.a.,  Applicant noted that the alcohol-\n1\nrelated offense was the only negative information in his record. Applicant is 62 years old, and\nmarried with four children. He seeks a secret security clearance. \nOn April 4, 2001 (subpargraph 1.a.), Applicant was charged with operating a vehicle while\nunder the influence of liquor (OUI). The arresting officer requested Applicant take a field sobriety\ntest. Applicant declined because he was still on crutches from a hip replacement. A breath test\nregistered \u201c.18,\u201d or .10 over the legal limit. Prosecution of the case was deferred without a finding,\nand Applicant was fined about $250.00, and required to attend an alcohol education program.\nApplicant successfully completed a group, alcohol education program. \n\n3\nIn response to subparagraph 2.a., Applicant explained that he was in a state of frustration\n(over unanticipated problems related to his hip replacement), and rationalization when he filled out\nthe security clearance application (SCA) on October 13, 2004. He stated:\n . . . and since the case (subparagraph 1.a.) was continued without a finding, I thought\nI could rationalize my way through the alcohol related questions. I was under the\napparent erroneous impression (which I discovered after I submitted the application)\nthat a negative response to the module in question would negate my chances of\ngetting a clearance and retaining the job (Item 2).\nApplicant also thought DOHA would look at his countervailing record showing 35 years of\nsafeguarding classified information with four defense contractors. I find Applicant intentionally\nomitted information from the SCA when he answered \u201cno\u201d to question 24 of the SCA on October\n13, 2004. \nApplicant provided explanations why he did not provide truthful information about the\nalcohol-related offense during the initial portions of his OPM interview (subparagraph 2.b.) on\nFebruary 19, 2006. First, he assumed that during the period between the SCA and his interview,\nDOHA had made the decision that Applicant\u2019s favorable information submitted in the security\ninvestigation had overcome the false information he provided in the SCA. Second, he assumed the\ninterview was only a formality to receiving a security clearance. Applicant reacted with surprise\nwhen he was asked about the OUI, but stated that he eventually talked about the OUI before the\ninterview was over. Applicant also became upset at the investigator for not showing him compassion\nduring the interview, and calling him a liar. Applicant was also embarrassed by the incident. The\nOPM investigator had to ask Applicant at least two times about the alcohol-related offense before\nApplicant finally conceded the information. I find Applicant intentionally concealed information\nfrom the investigator during the initial portions of the interview. \nIn his response to the FORM (March 19, 2006), Applicant considers his 36-year job record\nshould be strong evidence that he can be trusted to properly handle classified information. He\ndisagrees with the government\u2019s claim that he is candidate for influence because his family and his\nemployer are aware of the alcohol-related incident. Next, Applicant disagrees that his experience in\ncompleting other applications provided him with ample notice and time to internalize and answer\nall the SCA questions correctly. Applicant reiterated his displeasure over the lack of understanding\nabout his first-time experiences in the security investigation. If he had known that answering\npositively would have not jeopardized his career, then he would not have been intimidated about\nanswering questions about the alcohol-related offense. He still believes that insufficient attention\n(nine days) was given to presenting positive information in his record. Finally, Applicant asked if\nhe could be placed on probation for a period of time to prove his trustworthiness to DOHA. \nApplicant\u2019s program manager wrote a character statement on March 19, 2007. He stated that\nin the last two and one-half years, Applicant has demonstrated an outstanding job performance. \n\n4\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth guidelines containing disqualifying conditions (DC)\nand mitigating conditions (MC) that should be given binding consideration in making security\nclearance determinations. These conditions must be considered in every case along with the general\nfactors of the whole person concept. However, the conditions are not automatically determinative\nof the decision in any case nor can they supersede the Administrative Judge's reliance on his own\ncommon sense. \nBurden of Proof\nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, that conditions exist in the\npersonal or professional history of the applicant which disqualifies, or may disqualify, the applicant\nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484\nU.S. 518, 531 (1988) \u201c[T]he Directive presumes there is a nexus or rational connection between\nproven conduct under any of the Criteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.\u201d ISCR\nCase No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996) (quoting DISCR Case No. 92-1106 (App. Bd. Oct.\n7, 1993)). \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the\nburden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. \u201c[S]ecurity clearance\ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d See Egan, 481 U.S. at 531; see\nDirective E2.2.2.\nCriminal Conduct (Guideline J)\nViolation of the criminal law creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability and\ntrustworthiness. \nPersonal Conduct (Guideline E)\nThis guideline addresses conduct that involves questionable judgment, untrustworthiness or\ndishonesty. \nCONCLUSIONS\nCriminal conduct (CC) refers to a pattern of criminal activity that raises negative inferences\nabout a person\u2019s judgment, reliability and trustworthiness. Applicant\u2019s alcohol-related driving\noffense in April 2001 represents a one-time demonstration of poor judgment on the highways and\nis extenuated by the passage of time. However, Applicant concealed this offense when he submitted\n\n5\nhis SCA in October 2004. Next, Applicant was asked a couple times during his OPM interview in\nFebruary 2006 whether he had ever been charged or convicted of an alcohol-related incident. His\nresponse was that he had not. His deliberate omission of material information constitutes a violation\nof 18 Unites States Code (U.S.C.) \u00a7 1001, and falls within the scope of CC disqualifying condition\n(DC) E2.A10.1.2.1. (allegations or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person\nwas formally charged). \nThere are three mitigating conditions (MC) that are potentially relevant to the circumstances\nof this case: CC MC E2.A10.1.3.1. (the criminal behavior was not recent); CC MC E2.A10.1.3.2.\n(the criminal behavior was an isolated incident); and CC MC E2.A10.1.3.6. (there is clear evidence\nof successful rehabilitation). The first two mitigating conditions do not apply as Applicant\u2019s\ndeliberate falsifications were recent and there was more than one falsification. Clear evidence of\nsuccessful mitigation begins with providing truthful information during all phases of the security\ninvestigation. Applicant\u2019s 35 years with a security clearance while working for several defense\ncontractors, and having performed well for the last two and one-half years at his current job\nconstitutes favorable evidence of rehabilitation. However, this evidence does not meet Applicant\u2019s\nultimate burden of persuasion under CC MC E2.A10.1.3.6., as his most recent falsification occurred\nless than 18 months ago. I find against Applicant under the CC guideline.\nPersonal conduct (PC) is defined as exhibiting questionable judgment or dishonesty during\nthe security investigation. PC DC E2.A5.1.2.2. (the deliberate omission, concealment, or\nfalsification of relevant and material facts from a personnel security questionnaire used to determine\nsecurity clearance eligibility) applies to Applicant\u2019s  deliberate omission of material information\nfrom question 24 of the SCA in October 2004. During the initial portion of his OPM interview in\nFebruary 2006, Applicant deliberately concealed information about the alcohol-related offense on\ntwo occasions. PC DC E2.A5.1.2.3. (deliberately providing false information concerning relevant\nand material matters to an investigator in connection with a personnel security or trustworthiness\ndetermination) applies to the falsifications that occurred during the OPM interview in February 2006.\nPC MC E2.A5.1.3.1. (the information was unsubstantiated or not pertinent to a\ndetermination of judgment, trustworthiness or reliability) does not apply. Information about a\nperson\u2019s criminal record is important to the government\u2019s assessment of an applicant\u2019s overall\nsecurity suitability. Even though Applicant had only one criminal offense in his background, the\ngovernment (through the SCA and other investigative tools) has a legitimate right to know about\nalcohol-related behavior so that an informed decision can be made about Applicant\u2019s credentials. \nPC MC E2.A5.1.3.2. (the falsification was an isolated incident, was not recent, and the\nindividual has subsequently provided correct information voluntarily) does not apply due to the\nrecency of the falsifications. Though correct information was eventually provided, it was only after\nApplicant realized he could not credibly deny his alcohol-related offense in April 2001. \nPC MC E2.A5.1.3.3. (the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the\nfalsification before confronted with the facts) applies in those situations where the person comes\nforward with the information before being confronted with facts. Applicant concealed his DUI from\n\n6\nhis October 2004 SCA. He did not correct his falsifications until the investigator mentioned the\njurisdiction and approximate date when Applicant was arrested. PC MC E2.A5.11.3.3. does not\napply. The PC guideline is found against him. \nThe final determination for granting a security clearance must be an overall commonsense\ndetermination based upon careful consideration of the specific guidelines to be evaluated in the\ncontext of the whole person concept. While the DUI offense is serious, it is extenuated by the\npassage of time without recurrence. Conversely, Applicant\u2019s pattern of deliberate conduct in\nconcealing the conduct from his SCA in October 2004 and again on two occasions in February 2006\noccurred when he was between 60 and 62 years old. In October 2004, Applicant\u2019s choice was to\neither answer question 24 honestly, or rationalize his negative answer. He chose to provide false\ninformation. Though embarrassment and apprehension over losing his security clearance or his job\nwere the motivating factors for concealing the DUI, neither reason justifies lying on an SCA or in\nan interview.

The debts cited in the SOR total more then $27,000 and more debts were\nadmitted at the hearing.  Applicant falsified his Public Trust Position Application by citing only one\ndelinquent debt and intentionally omitting those cited in the SOR.  Some reimbursement has been\nmade through garnishment, and Applicant has retained an attorney to file for bankruptcy protection.\nNumerous fellow employees and others are consistent in averring that Applicant is a man who can\nbe trusted to protect classified information.  Applicant is on the path to financial rehabilitation.\nAdequate mitigation has been established.  Eligibility for Trustworthiness Determination is granted.\nClearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn August 31, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant\nto Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated\nJanuary 2, 1992, as amended, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant.  The\nSOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding\nrequired under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or\ncontinue a trustworthiness determination allowing Applicant to work in Automated Data\nProcessing positions such as ADP I, II, or III.  The SOR recommended referral to an\nAdministrative Judge to conduct proceedings and determine whether such a finding should\nbe granted, denied or revoked.\nOn November 29, 2006, Applicant responded to the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nand elected to have a decision made by a DOHA Administrative Judge after a hearing.  The\ncase was assigned to me on December 18, 2006.  A  Notice of Hearing was issued on January\n8, 2006, setting the hearing for February 13, 2007. At the hearing, Department Counsel\nintroduced seven (7) exhibits (Government\u2019s Exhibits (GX) 1-7.  Applicant introduced six (6)\nexhibits (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A - F).  He has also submitted post hearing documents\nthat have been marked and admitted as AX G-AX T.  The hearing transcript was received at\nDOHA on February 22, 2007.\nIt has been brought to my attention that I had agreed at the February 3, 2007 hearing\nto keep the record open until Close of Business on March 6, 2007, to allow Applicant to\nobtain and submit additional documents.  I inadvertently moved too quickly and issued a\nDecision on February 28, 2007.  Applicant did submit additional documents after the Decision\nwas issued, but before the time allowed had expired.  Applicant is entitled to have those\ndocuments evaluated and considered by me in making my decision.  Accordingly, I have\nconsidered the new material and have issued this Amended Decision.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\n\n3\nApplicant is a 30-year-old employee of a defense contractor.  The SOR contains 12\nallegations under Guideline F (Financial).  Applicant admits allegations except for 1.b., and\n1.c., with explanations.  Applicant denies allegation 2.a., under Guideline E (Personal\nConduct).  All admissions are accepted and incorporated herein as Findings of Fact.  \nAfter considering the totality of the evidence, I make the following additional\nFINDINGS OF FACT as to the status of each SOR allegation.\nGuideline F (Financial) \nApplicant has a history of 12 delinquent debts owed to the following creditors in the\napproximate amounts cited:\n1.a.   Creditor A (placed for collection in May 2000)------------------------------$1,000.00\n1.b.  Creditor B (placed for collection in June 2001) ----------------------------- $5,913.00\n1.c.  Creditor C (placed for collection in March 2002)--------------------------- $2,710.00\n1.d. Creditor D (charged off in November 2002) --------------------------------\n$18,384.00  1.e. Creditor E (placed for collection in August 2003) ----------------------------\n$220.00 \n \n1.f. Creditor F (placed for collection in November 2003) ---------------------$2,240.00\n1.g. Creditor G (placed for collection) -----------------------------------------------\n$1,437.00 1.h. Creditor H (placed for collection in November 2004)-----------------------\n$150.00\n1.i. Creditor I (placed for collection in May 2005) ------------------------------- $38700\n1.j. Creditor J (placed for collection in July 2005)-------------------------------   $534.00\n1.k. Creditor K (placed for collection in January 2006) ------------------------- $210.00\n1.l.  Creditor L (placed or collection in March 2006) ----------------------------$310.00\nThe 12 delinquent debts total about $27,917.00.  As of March 6, 2007, Applicant\ndecided to file for bankruptcy and has signed a contract with a law firm to begin the\nbankruptcy process (AX G).   \nApplicant has submitted a number or letters of recommendation (AX H-AX O).  The\nspecific language of each letter can be combined into a number of common themes describing\nApplicant as: hardworking, loyal, trustworthy, dependable, excellent work ethic (AX H, AX\nJ, AX K, AX L), character of the highest caliber as to his honesty, sincere and truthful,\nreliable (AX I), highly respected (AX L), positive attitude (AX M), responsible in paying his\nshare of th rent (AX N)   \n \nGuideline E (Personal Conduct)  \n\n4\n2.a. - Applicant falsified material facts on his Public Trust Position Application (SF\n85P) of March 21, 2005, in which he answered Question 20 - Your Financial Record - 180\nDay Delinquencies Are you now over 180 days delinquent on any loan or financial\nobligation; to which he listed only an auto loan with Company X, but deliberately omitted any\nmention of the debts cited above in 1.a., 1.b., 1.c., 1.e., 1.f., and 1.g.  As I understand\nApplicant\u2019s answer to the sole allegation under Guideline E, he admits the incorrect answer,\nbut denies it was deliberate.\nPOLICIES \nIn evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the adjudicator should consider\nthe following nine generic factors: (1). The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2)\nThe circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3). The\nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the\nconduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation\nand other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential\nfor pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence (Directive, E.2.2.1., on page 16 of Enclosure 2).  I have considered all nine factors,\nindividually and collectively, in reaching my overall conclusion.\nThe eligibility criteria established by Executive Order 10865 and DoD Directive\n5220.6  identify personal characteristics and conduct that are reasonably related to the\nultimate question of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d for an\nindividual to hold a security clearance.  An applicant\u2019s admission of the information in\nspecific allegations relieves the Government of having to prove those allegations.  If specific\nallegations and/or information are denied or  otherwise controverted by the applicant, the\nGovernment has the initial burden of proving those  controverted facts alleged in the\nStatement of Reasons.  \nIf the Government meets its burden (either by the Applicant\u2019s admissions or by other\nevidence) and proves conduct that creates security  concerns under the Directive, the burden\nof persuasion then shifts to the Applicant to present  evidence in refutation, extenuation or\nmitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the existence of conduct that falls within\nspecific criteria in the Directive, it is nevertheless consistent with the interests of national\nsecurity to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.\nA person seeking access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the Government based upon trust and confidence.  As required by DoD Directive 5220.6,\nas amended, at E2.2.2., \u201cany doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly\nconsistent with the interests of national security will be resolved in favor of the nation\u2019s\n\n5\nsecurity.\u201d\nCONCLUSIONS \nApplicant is 30 years old.  All 12 allegations under Guideline F are supported by the\nrecord.  The earliest delinquent debt (1.a.) was referred for collection in May 2000 and the\nlast one (1.l), was referred for collection in March 2006.  All of the debts remain owing, but\nsome payments have been made by garnishment (GX 4, GX5, and GX 6 and the other\nGovernment documents (GX 1, GX 2, and GX 3).\nAt the hearing, Applicant testified that his salary is presently being garnished for a\nstudent loan [debt] (Tr at 19).  Leave and Earning Statements show garnishment of $840.78\nas of February 23, 2007 (AX Q, AX P, AX R).  His exhibits mostly consist of documents\ncaptioned \u201cView Paycheck\u201d (AX A, AX B, AX C, AX D, AX E, and AX F).  These cover the\nperiod from September 15, 2006 to November 24, 2006.   \nApplicant explained that the documents show \u201cthe financial pinch I was put in when\nthe garnishment had taken place,\u201d because his net income dropped from about $1,200.00 to\na little under $600.00 a paycheck, \u201cwhich hampered a lot of my ability\u201d (Tr at 21).  He \u201cwas\ntrying to file for bankruptcy some time during those months and [he] couldn\u2019t do it because\nthey needed a very large payment to get it started.  And being a single father, [he] was not\nable to do it\u201d (Id).  In addition one creditor was \u201cremoving funds from my pay and its getting\npaid by a judgment . . .\u201d   \nAt the hearing on February 13, 2007, Applicant explained that as to allegations:\n1.a., 1.b., 1.e., and 1.l,  he was not sure what the debts were for and/or had been\nunsuccessful in contacting them (Tr at 27, 29). \n1.c., 1and 1.h.,  he believes the debt was \u201csupposed to be taken care of by his ex-wife\u201d\nand he will have to take the initiative to resolve the debts (Tr at 27, 28, 29).  \n    \n1.d., the debt  pertains to a \u201crepossessed car\u201d that he  returned when he was unable to\nkeep up with the payments.  He has not been able to contact anyone to resolve the debt (Tr\nat 28, 29) \n1.f. and 1.g, the debts are for student loans - these are the debts that are being\nrecovered by garnishment of funds from his salary (Tr at 29).\n1.i., 1.j., and 1,k, he has been unsuccessful in reaching an agreement with the creditor\n(Id.).      \n\n6\nThe record is compelling that Applicant has had significant delinquent debts going\nback to at least 2000 and continuing to the present.  In his exhibits (AX A - AX E), the record\nshows deductions of \u201cMedical - $555.59\u201d that are not cited in the SOR.  These are for\nrecoupment of \u201cdisability payments\u201d (Tr at 35) to which Applicant was apparently not\nentitled.\nApplicant testified that he had recently contacted a \u201ccreditor counselor\u201d and made an\nappointment for February 23, 2007, ten days after the hearing (Tr at 30). This contact has\nresulted in an agreement whereby a law firm will begin the bankruptcy process (AX G, AX\nS, and AX T).  Whatever risk there was in the past, when he owed more than $27,000, that\nrisk is minimized by the ongoing resolution of his debt situation by payments and bankruptcy\nThe Concern expressed in Financial Consideration cases is that: an individual who is\nfinancially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nUnexplained affluence is often linked to proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.\nDisqualifying Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying\ninclude: (1). A history of not meeting financial obligations; and (3). Inability or unwillingness\nto satisfy debts.  \nMitigating Conditions: (3). The conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the\nperson's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or\na death, divorce or separation); and (6). The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue\ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts.\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct)\n2.a. - I have carefully considered Applicant\u2019s explanations for the false answer (Tr at\n30, 31).  He admits the answer was false, but he denies it was intentional.  He answered\n\u201cYes,\u201d and cited one debt, but omitted the others.  His reasoning remains unclear as to why\nhe answered this way, but he continues to deny it was deliberate. Under the totality of the\ncircumstances, and viewing Applicant under the whole person concept, his answer remains\nstrange, but credible and a solitary act of questionable conduct.  \nThe Concern: Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness,\nunreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations\ncould indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information. \nDisqualifying Conditions: 2. The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of\nrelevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history\nstatement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or\ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.\nMitigating Conditions: (2)The falsification was an isolated incident, although it remains\nrecent. \n\n7\nApplicant could certainly have exercised better judgment in the past under both\nguidelines.  He is late coming to financial rehabilitation, but he has begun the journey with\na better understanding of his financial responsibilities than he had prior to the hearing.\nViewing Applicant under the whole person concept, the totality of the evidence, I conclude\nthere is minimal likelihood of continuation or recurrence (Directive, E.2.2.1., page 16 of\nEnclosure 2).  \nApplicant\u2019s post hearing evidence, including the praise of so many coworkers, makes a case\nthat he has matured and can be relied upon to follow the rules.  On this basis, I conclude he\nadequately mitigated the concerns expressed under Guideline E. \nOverall, I conclude that Applicant has demonstrated that he currently possesses the judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness required of someone seeking access to the nation\u2019s secrets. \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings as required by Section 3, Paragraph 7 of Enclosure 1 of the Directive are\nhereby rendered as follows:\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) \n \nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph  l.a.\n          \nFor the Applicant\n                \nSubparagraph 1.b.              \nFor the Applicant\n            \nSubparagraph 1.c.       \n    \nFor the Applicant\n           Subparagraph 1.d.   \nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph  l.e.           \nFor the Applicant\n                \nSubparagraph 1.f.               \nFor the Applicant\n            \nSubparagraph  l.g.           \nFor the Applicant\n                \nSubparagraph 1.h.               \nFor the Applicant\n            \nSubparagraph 1.i.           \nFor the Applicant\n           Subparagraph 1.j.    \n           \nFor the Applicant\n            \nSubparagraph 1.k.           \nFor the Applicant\n           Subparagraph 1.l. \n                                            For the Applicant\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) \nFor the Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.a. \n                                            For the Applicant  \n         \nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nBARRY M.

On August 17, 2006, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons  (SOR)\n1\n2\ndetailing the basis for its decision\u2013trustworthiness concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations) of the Directive.  Applicant answered the SOR in writing on November 9, 2006, and\nelected to have a hearing before an administrative judge.  The case was assigned to me on December\n18, 2006.  On January 30, 2007, I convened a hearing to consider whether it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue a trustworthiness determination for Applicant.  The\nGovernment and the Applicant submitted exhibits that were admitted into evidence.  Applicant was\ngiven additional time to submit other exhibits.  She did so and without objection from the\nGovernment they were admitted into the record and marked as Exhibits L to Z.  The Government\nmoved to amend the SOR to delete a reference to paragraph 3-614, DoD Regulation 5200.2-R in the\nprecatory language of the SOR because it was not applicable to this proceeding.  The Applicant\nhaving no objection, I granted the motion (Tr. 8).

There\nwere no other service providers operating when they started their business.  Applicant worked as the\nbusiness manager.  In the late 1990s the governments reduced their reimbursement schedules, and\ncompetitors entered the field.  Applicant\u2019s business started to decline until she and her husband\nclosed it on May 24, 2002.  While they were operating profitably in the mid-1990s, their total income\n\n4\nwas $70,000 on a gross business income of $220,000.  She currently earns $24,500, and last year her\nhusband earned $14,500, plus $3,600 teaching a part-time course at a local college.  During that\nperiod, in 1995, they purchased two lots in the surrounding countryside and built a house that cost,\nwith the land, $290,000.  Their monthly mortgage payments were $1,600.  They refinanced the house\nseveral times to put money into their business to keep it going, with the mortgage balance eventually\nincreasing to $349,000.  They later tried to sell the house and the adjoining lotto pay debts and keep\ntheir house.  The bank eventually repossessed the house, and nothing is owed on that loan.  After\nthey closed the business, Applicant took what jobs she could find in her locale, and her husband did\nthe same.  He was laid off from his last job in October 2006, and due to his age and health has not\nbeen able to find other employment.  He looks diligently for work.  He draws unemployment of $149\nweekly when he can receive it, but has not been paid for 10 weeks presently. (Tr. 32, 33, 36, 38, 45,\n48, 69, 71; Exhibits B, H)\nDuring the time the business operated, Applicant and her husband opened a line of credit\nwith a local bank and paid regularly the interest and any money borrowed on the line of credit.\nApplicant did not pay the full employment taxes to the state and federal governments in later years\nwhen the business income decreased because they paid their employees first.  A portion of those\ntaxes remain unpaid at present.  She also charged some credit cards with business expenses to keep\nthe business operating, and a balance is owed for those delinquent debts.  Applicant\u2019s present net\nmonthly income of $1,050 leaves her with $34 after payment of rent, utilities, food, and other normal\nexpenses.  Applicant and her husband used $60,000 from an inheritance from his mother to repay\nbusiness debts in 1998. (Tr. 40, 48, 56, 60, 61, 62-65, 75; Exhibit 2)\nApplicant owes $23,503 to a bank at which her business had its line of credit (SOR\nsubparagraph 1.a).  She was making monthly payments of $200 from the beginning of 2004 until\nApril, 2005, when her husband was falsely accused of some misconduct by one of their foster\nchildren.  That accusation caused the foster care home they operated to close and that income was\nlost.  She paid $3,200 on that debt.  In a debt not listed in the SOR but disclosed at the hearing,\nApplicant also owes $14,000 to the state court for the fee of the court-appointed attorney who\nrepresented her husband in the false accusation charge, from which he was exonerated.  She and her\nhusband had a $50 monthly repayment plan that they could not maintain when their income dropped\ndue to his unemployment. \nApplicant\u2019s debt to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for employment taxes is $12,016 for\nwhich a lien was placed by the IRS (SOR subparagraph 1.b).  Applicant had an installment\nagreement for $200 monthly with the IRS in January 2004.  She was unable to maintain those\npayments.  The IRS took any income tax refunds due annually, and Applicant reduced her tax\nliability by $6,800 through the offsets.  Applicant claims she files an annual statement with the IRS\nand it deems her income so low that the debt is considered uncollectible except through the use of\nthe offset procedure.  In another debt not listed in the SOR but disclosed at the hearing, Applicant\nowes her state tax department employment taxes from the business.  That tax department also offset\nher state tax liability with the annual tax refunds on her state taxes.  That debt is currently $9,819.91.\nIn October 2003 the tax liability was $22,460.82.  Applicant reduced the tax liability in four years\nby over $12,000.\n\n5\nApplicant owes $51 to a collector (SOR subparagraph 1.c).  She contacted the collector in\nOctober 2006.  She contacted them again after receiving nothing for six weeks, and received\ninformation about the delinquent debt.  She will pay it when she has the available money.  \nThe credit card debts in SOR subparagraphs 1.d. ($1,933), subparagraph 1.e. ($581), and\nsubparagraph 1.f. ($1,498) were incurred for business and personal purchases.  Applicant has not\nrepaid these debts because of a lack of available funds, but she is seeking a settlement amount with\nthe company to repay these debts.  She does not now have any credit cards.  She owes a mail-order\nbusiness $849 on its credit card (SOR subparagraph 1.g.).  Her final delinquent debt is $11,934 to\na financial institution from which she borrowed money in 1997 for the business (SOR subparagraph\n1.h.).  Applicant does not want to declare bankruptcy, but tries to pay these debts when she has the\nincome to do so.  She reduced her expenses to the basics needed to survive, leaving her with the net\nmonthly income of $34. (Tr. 30, 56-68, 74, 100; Exhibits 1-3, G-R)\nApplicant\u2019s employee performance report shows she works at or above expected production\nrates.  Her co-workers and friends wrote several letters about Applicant\u2019s excellent work\nperformance and trustworthiness. (Exhibits I, S-Z)\nPOLICIES\nAs Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information\nbearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to\noccupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d Department of the Navy\nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 527 (1988).  The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his\ndesignee to grant applicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that\nit is clearly consistent the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation with Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960).  By direction of the Under Secretary of Defense for\nCounterintelligence and Security, adjudications of cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense\nSecurity Service or the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) for a trustworthiness determination\nshall be conducted under the provisions of the Directive.  Eligibility for a position of trust is\npredicated upon the applicant meeting the guidelines contained in the Directive and a finding it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so. See Directive \u00b6 2.3.  An applicant \u201chas the\nultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or\ncontinue his trustworthiness determination.\u201d See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15\nThe adjudication process is based on the whole person concept.  Enclosure 2 of the Directive\nsets forth personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating\nconditions (MC) under each guideline that must be carefully considered in making the overall\ncommon sense determination required.  The decision to deny an individual eligibility to occupy a\nposition of trust is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  See Exec. Or.\n10865 \u00a7 7.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President\nand the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a such a determination.\nIn evaluating the trustworthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess\nthe adjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6 6.3 of the Directive.  Those assessments include:  (1) the\nnature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, and\nthe extent of knowledgeable participation; (3) how recent and frequent the behavior was; (4) the\n\n6\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6)\nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood\nof continuation or recurrence (See Directive, Section E2.2.1. of Enclosure 2).  Because each case\npresents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that the factors exhaust\nthe realm of human experience or that the factors apply equally in every case.  Moreover, although\nadverse information concerning a single condition may not be sufficient for an unfavorable\ndetermination, the individual may be disqualified if available information reflects a recent or\nrecurring pattern of questionable judgment, irresponsibility, or other behavior specified in the\nGuidelines.\nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal\nor professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being\neligible to occupy a position of trust.  The Directive presumes a nexus or rational connection\nbetween proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an\napplicant\u2019s trustworthiness suitability.  See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).\nAll that is required is proof of facts and circumstances that indicate an applicant is at risk for\nmishandling classified information, or that an applicant does not demonstrate the high degree of\njudgment, reliability, or trustworthiness required of persons handling classified information.  ISCR\nCase No. 00-0277, 2001 DOHA LEXIS 335 at **6-8 (App. Bd. 2001).  Once the Government has\nestablished a prima facie case by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut,\nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate\nburden of demonstrating that is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his\ntrustworthiness determination. ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. 2002).  \u201cAny doubt as to\nwhether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved\nin favor of the national security.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E2.2.2\nBased upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative\nguideline most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:\nGuideline F: Financial Considerations: The Concern: An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. E2.A6.1.1\n\u201cThe standard that must be met for . . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all\navailable information, the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that  . . .\nassigning the person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d\n(Regulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1)  Appendix 8 of the Regulation sets forth the adjudicative policy, as well as\nthe disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) associated with each guideline.\nDoD contractor personnel are afforded the adjudication procedures contained in the Directive.\n(Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1)\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n7\nFinancial Considerations:  Applicant\u2019s history of not being able to repay her debts goes\nback to the mid-1990's when the business she and her husband operated started to suffer a financial\ndecline from government cut-backs and competition from larger organizations.  As a result, she\ncould not pay all of the employment taxes due on behalf of her employees in certain periods, as the\nbusiness income decreased, preferring to pay her employees first.  Applicant has been unable  to\nrepay her debts because of her low income and her husband\u2019s nearly non-existent job prospects due\nto his age and health problems.  Disqualifying Conditions (DC) 1 (A history of not meeting financial\nobligations E2.A6.1.2.1), DC 2 (Deceptive or illegal financial practices such as income tax evasion\nE2.A6.1.2.2), and DC 3 (Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts E2.A6.1.2.3) apply.  \nHowever, the conditions that resulted in Applicant\u2019s situation were beyond her control when\nthe governments who provided the social service funding for her business reduced the funding and\nincreased the reimbursement time schedule.  She also faced competition from larger health care\nproviders who provided the same psychological counseling services Applicant and her husband did.\nAfter operating the business for 12 years, they were forced to close it.  The only jobs they could find\nwere low paying, under $25,000 annually, and her husband\u2019s heart and other physical ailments\nprevented him from finding consistent employment.  His age also foreclosed many jobs from him\nas employers preferred younger persons.  Applicant\u2019s husband will start collecting Social Security\npayments this year, and that money can be used to repay the debts listed in the SOR.  Applicant has\nagreed to installment payment plans on several debts, but then her declining income prevented her\nfrom continuing to meet those scheduled payments.  Through offsets by the IRS and state taxing\nbodies, she has reduced her tax liabilities resulting from the failed business.  Mitigating Conditions\n(MC) 3 (Conditions resulting in the behavior were beyond Applicant\u2019s control because of a business\ndownturn, competition from larger service providers, and unexpected medical conditions.\nE2.A6.1.3.3), and MC 6 (Applicant initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts E2.A6.1.3.6) apply.  Applicant wants to repay her creditors, and has tried\nto do so within her financial means.\nWhole Person Analysis\nIn evaluating Applicant\u2019s case, I considered the adjudicative process factors listed in the\nDirective \u00b6 E2.2.1.  I used the nine factors listed in the Directive and set forth in POLICIES to\nevaluate the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d as it applies to Applicant.\nAs a whole person, Applicant is credible and persuasive in her presentation of the history of\nher financial situation, and her commitment to repay her debts.  She has not incurred any more debt\nsince 2002, and lives simply with her husband.  The Social Security payments starting this year will\nbe a large boost to their joint income, enabling them to repay the smaller debts first, and then enter\nrepayment schedules with the other creditors, as Applicant has committed to do.  She will also try\nto compromise and settle the delinquent debts she cannot repay.  Based on her record of repayment,\nshe demonstrated good judgment and commitment to repay her debts resulting from the failed\nbusiness.  Her conduct will not recur because she is not now running, nor is it likely she ever will\nagain, operate a private business where she could incur such debts.  Her motivation, underlying the\ndebt accumulation in the 1990s, was to make the business a success and serve a population that\nneeded psychological services.  I also weigh heavily the actions of the government funding agencies\nthat initially supported Applicant\u2019s business, but then reduced the funding, causing the small\nbusiness to fail.  Applicant served a population the larger service providers did not touch until after\n\n8\n1996, and then the competition Applicant could not meet because she lacked the financial and\nmarketing resources her competitors had.\nBased on all the evidence presented, I conclude the financial considerations trustworthiness\nconcern for Applicant.  I also conclude that the whole person concept shows she is trustworthy,\nreliable, and is exercising good judgment.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.  Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for assignment to sensitive duties.  Her\napplication for eligibility for an ADP I/II/III position is granted.\nPhilip S. Howe\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Applicant has\napplied to formally renounce her Taiwanese citizenship. Applicant has mitigated the foreign\ninfluence concerns raised by her elderly mother in Taiwan. Clearance is granted.\n\nPursuant to Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), as\n1\namended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (Directive).\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for Applicant. On August 24, 2006, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons  (SOR)\n1\ndetailing the basis for its decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence)\nand Guideline C (Foreign Preference) of the Directive. Applicant answered the SOR in writing on\nSeptember 23, 2006, and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was\nassigned to me on January 18, 2007. A notice of hearing was issued on February 22, 2007,\nscheduling the hearing for March 28, 2007. The hearing was conducted as scheduled to consider\nwhether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for\nApplicant. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on April 11, 2007.\nRULINGS ON PROCEDURE AND EVIDENCE\nApplicant submitted a Motion for a Bill of Particulars, requesting notice of the facts that\nsupport SOR \u00b6 2.a, which alleges Applicant \u201cexercise[s] dual citizenship with Taiwan and the United\nStates.\u201d The Motion was marked as HE XIV. The Government responded with a Motion to Amend\nthe Statement of Reasons, marked as HE XV, moving to delete SOR \u00b6 2.b, and modify SOR \u00b6 2.a,\nas follows:\nAfter becoming a naturalized United States citizen in about October 1993, you\nexercised dual citizenship with Taiwan and the United States by applying for a\nTaiwanese passport in about May 1996, and then used it to travel to Taiwan.\nApplicant did not object to the Motion to Amend the Statement of Reasons, and was satisfied that\nit answered their Motion for a Bill of Particulars. The Motion to Amend the Statement of Reasons\nwas granted. SOR \u00b6 2.a is now as stated above. SOR \u00b6 2.b is deleted.\nDepartment Counsel submitted a Motion for Appropriate Relief requesting that Applicant\nbe ordered to disclose her witness list, to include contact numbers, and a summary of their expected\ntestimony. The Motion was marked as HE XVI. Applicant\u2019s response was marked as HE XVII. The\nmotion was denied.

GE 6 was offered and admitted.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the allegations in the SOR are incorporated herein. In addition,\nafter a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following\nfindings of fact.\nApplicant is a 51-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She is single with no children.\nApplicant was born in Taiwan. She received her bachelor\u2019s degree in Taiwan in 1978. She came to\nthe United States in 1979, to further her education. She received a Ph.D. from an American\nuniversity in 1987. Applicant became a U.S. citizen in about October 1993.2\nApplicant\u2019s father passed away a long time ago. Her mother is 76 years old. She is a citizen\nand resident of Taiwan. She has an elementary school education, and does not work. Applicant\u2019s\nmother visited Applicant and Applicant\u2019s brother in the United States on three occasions, in 1980,\nwhen Applicant\u2019s niece was born, 1990 or 1991, and 2004 or 2005. Applicant has not seen her\nmother since that trip. She talks to her mother about twice a month. Applicant would like her mother\nto immigrate to the U.S., but her mother has decided to remain in Taiwan.3\nApplicant\u2019s only sibling is a citizen and resident of the United States. He received a Master\nof Science degree in engineering from a U.S. university. He came to the U.S. before Applicant, and\n\nTr. at 148-149; GE 1 at 16-22.\n4\nTr. at 166-167; AE B.\n5\nTr. at 152-156; AE D, E.\n6\nTr. at 156-163; AE V, W.\n7\nTr. at 151, 178-179; AE B.\n8\nTr. at 63-70.\n9\n5\nbecame a U.S. citizen before her, in 1990. He is married with two adult children. His wife is a U.S.\ncitizen. Both of his children were born in the United States.4\nApplicant\u2019s brother inherited the family house in Taiwan from his grandparents more than\n30 years ago. At that time only male children could inherit property. An old house was on the\nproperty. The house was torn down and a four apartment building was constructed. Two apartments\nwere sold to finance the construction. Applicant\u2019s mother lives in one of the remaining apartments.\nShe lives off the rent from the fourth apartment. She does not earn a pension from the government\nof Taiwan. Applicant\u2019s brother sends their mother about $3,000 per year to supplement her income.\nApplicant sends her about $500 per year.5\nApplicant obtained a Taiwanese passport in about May 1996. She obtained the passport so\nthat she could travel to Taiwan for more than two weeks if her mother became ill. Her mother was\nfrequently ill and had an operation, but did not inform Applicant or her brother. Applicant later\ndiscovered that she could also travel for longer than two weeks with her U.S. passport. She never\nused the Taiwanese passport, and did not renew it after it expired in 2002. She traveled to Taiwan\nin 2000 and 2002. She used her U.S. passport when she traveled to Taiwan on both occasions. She\nobtained a visa from Taiwan for the 2002 trip. The visa authorized her to stay in Taiwan for 60 days,\nwith multiple entries.6\nApplicant has applied to renounce her Taiwanese citizenship. Additional forms and\ndocuments are being obtained from Applicant\u2019s mother in order to process the application. Applicant\nattempted to return her expired Taiwanese passport to the Taiwan government, but they refused to\ntake it until all the documents are received. Once she receives all the documents, Applicant will\nsubmit the documents and her expired passport to Taiwanese authorities.7\nApplicant does not own any foreign property or assets. She owns her house in the United\nStates, and her net worth is approximately $500,000.8\nApplicant has worked as an engineer for several employers. A former supervisor, who\ntestified on Applicant\u2019s behalf, described her as honest, hard-working, and reliable.

Appellant is very active in her religious community. One of the members of Applicant\u2019s\n10\nreligious community has a child with a learning disability.

The mother testified that Applicant is honest, enthusiastic, reliable, and a good person.11\nOther witnesses stated Applicant was a person of integrity, a mentor, a role model, dedicated, and\na good friend who treats people with kindness and honesty.12\nIn 1949, Taiwan was populated by refugees fleeing a civil war in China. That same year,\nCommunists in mainland China established the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), and a separate,\nindependent government was established in Taiwan. The PRC does not recognize Taiwan, and insists\nthere is only \u201cone China.\u201d13\nTaiwan is a multi-part democracy. Through nearly five decades of hard work and sound\neconomic management, Taiwan has transformed itself from an underdeveloped, agricultural island\nto an economic power that is a leading producer of high-technology goods.14\nOn January 1, 1979, the United States formally recognized the PRC as the sole legal\ngovernment of China. The U.S. also announced that it would maintain cultural, commercial, and\nother unofficial relations with the people on Taiwan. The Taiwan Relations Act (TRA) signed into\nlaw on April 10, 1979, created the legal authority for the conduct of unofficial relations with Taiwan.\nThe American Institute in Taiwan, a private nonprofit corporation with offices in Taiwan, is\nauthorized to issue visas, accept passport applications, and provide assistance to U.S. citizens in\nTaiwan. A counterpart organization was established by Taiwan. It has multiple offices in the U.S.15\nMaintaining strong, unofficial relations with Taiwan is a major U.S. goal. The U.S. does not\nsupport Taiwan independence, but it does support Taiwan\u2019s membership in appropriate international\norganizations such as the World Trade Organization (WTO), which it accessed in 2002, Asia-Pacific\nEconomic Cooperation (APEC) forum, and the Asian Development Bank. In addition, the U.S.\nsupports appropriate opportunities for Taiwan\u2019s voice to be heard in organizations where its\nmembership is not possible.16\nThe TRA enshrines the U.S. commitment to assisting Taiwan maintain its defensive\ncapability. The U.S. continues to sell appropriate defensive military equipment to Taiwan, in\naccordance with the TRA. President Bush publicly stated in 2001 that the United States would do\n\u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to help Taiwan\u2019s defense and approved a substantial sale of U.S. weapons to\nTaiwan, including destroyers, anti-submarine aircraft, and diesel submarines.

Taiwan\u2019s new president\ndisavowed key concepts long embraced by the opposing party - the \u201cstatus quo\u201d that there is only\none China and Taiwan is part of it - and instead has adopted the more provocative position that\nTaiwan already \u201cis an independent, sovereign country,\u201d a \u201cstatus quo\u201d he promises to maintain.\nThere was also a series of recent corruption scandals.  \n18\nIn response to Taiwan\u2019s political developments, the Administration appears to have dialed\nback its earlier enthusiasm for supporting Taiwan\u2019s initiatives. While still pursuing a close\nrelationship with Taiwan, U.S. officials now appear to be balancing criticisms of the PRC military\nbuildup opposite Taiwan with periodic cautions and warnings to the effect that U.S. support for\nTaiwan is not unconditional, but has limits.  \n19\nChina is a large and economically powerful country, with a population of over a billion\npeople and an economy growing at about 10% per year. China has an authoritarian government,\ndominated by the Chinese Communist Party. China has a poor record with respect to human rights,\nsuppresses political dissent, and its practices include arbitrary arrest and detention, forced\nconfessions, torture, and mistreatment of prisoners.20\nBoth China and Taiwan are known to be active collectors of U.S. economic intelligence. The\nPRC also maintains intelligence operations in Taiwan.21\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  As Commander in Chief, the President has\n22\n\u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine\nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person\naccess to such information.\u201d  The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to\n23\ngrant applicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly\n\nExec.

Or. 10865 \u00a7 7.\n27\n8\nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  An applicant has the ultimate burden of\n24\ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his or her\nsecurity clearance. The clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations\nshould err, if they must, on the side of denials.  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant\n25\nshould be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such\nsensitive information.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a\n26\ndetermination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not\nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a\nclearance.  \n27\nThe Directive sets forth potentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions\n(MC) under each guideline. Additionally, each security clearance decision must be a fair and\nimpartial commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the\nwhole-person concept, along with the adjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6 6.3 and \u00b6 E2.2.1 of the\nDirective.\nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those\nwhich would mitigate security concerns, pertaining to the adjudicative guidelines are set forth and\ndiscussed in the conclusions section below.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards discussed above.\nI reach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the SOR.\nGuideline B, Foreign Influence\nA security risk may exist when an individual\u2019s immediate family, including cohabitants, and\nother persons to whom he or she may be bound by affection, influence, or obligation are not citizens\nof the United States or may be subject to duress. These situations could create the potential for\nforeign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information. Contacts with\ncitizens of other countries or financial interests in other countries are also relevant to security\ndeterminations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or\npressure. \nForeign Influence Disqualifying Condition (FI DC) E2.A2.1.2.1 (An immediate family\nmember, or a person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of,\n\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15; ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n28\nISCR Case No. 02-14995 (App. Bd. Jul. 26, 2004).\n29\n9\nor resident or present in, a foreign country) applies. Applicant\u2019s mother is a citizen and resident of\nTaiwan.\nSince the government produced substantial evidence to establish FI DC E2.A2.1.2.1, the\nburden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate security\nconcerns raised by these facts. Applicant has the burden of proving mitigation, and the burden of\ndisproving it is never shifted to the government.  \n28\nI considered all the Foreign Influence Mitigating Conditions (FI MC), and especially FI MC\nE2.A2.1.3.1 (A determination that the immediate family member(s), (spouse, mother, sons,\ndaughters, brothers, sisters), cohabitant, or associate(s) in question are not agents of a foreign\npower or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual\nto choose between loyalty to the person(s) involved and the United States) and FI MC E2.A2.1.3.3\n(Contact and correspondence with foreign citizens are casual and infrequent).\nNotwithstanding the facially disjunctive language of FI MC E2.A2.1.3.1 (\u201cagents of a foreign\npower or in a position to be exploited\u201d), it requires proof that an applicant\u2019s family member(s),\ncohabitant(s), or associate(s) in question are (a) not agents of a foreign power, and (b) not in a\nposition to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the applicant to choose between\nthe person(s) involved and the United States.  \n29\nApplicant\u2019s mother has no association with the government of Taiwan, and is not an agent\nof a foreign power. In determining the second prong of FI MC E2.A2.1.3.1, I specifically considered\nthe nature of the government of Taiwan, as discussed above, and the risk of espionage. Because of\nTaiwan\u2019s intelligence operations, I am unable to totally apply FI MC E2.A2.1.3.1.\nFI MC E2.A2.1.3.3 does not apply because Applicant\u2019s contacts with her mother are not\ncasual or infrequent.\nGuideline C, Foreign Preference\nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over\nthe United States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are\nharmful to the interests of the United States. \nBased on all the evidence, Foreign Preference Disqualifying Condition (FP DC)  E2.A3.1.2.1\n(The exercise of dual citizenship) and FP DC E2.A3.1.2.2 (Possession and/or use of a foreign\npassport) apply in this case. Applicant obtained and used a Taiwanese passport after becoming a U.S.\ncitizen. This constitutes an exercise of her Taiwanese citizenship.\nI have considered all the Foreign Preference Mitigating Conditions (FP MC), and I especially\nconsidered FP MC E2.A3.1.3.1 (Dual citizenship is based solely on parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in\na foreign country) and FP MC E2.A3.1.3.4 (The individual has expressed a willingness to renounce\n\nISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004).\n30\n10\ndual citizenship). I do not find FP MC E2.A3.1.3.1 totally applicable. Applicant actively exercised\nher dual citizenship by using a Taiwanese passport after becoming a U.S. citizen. FP MC\nE2.A3.1.3.4 is applicable. Applicant has not only expressed a willingness to renounce dual\ncitizenship; she has formally begun the process to renounce her Taiwanese citizenship.\nWhole Person Analysis\nThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is an acceptable security risk. Available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in\nreaching a determination. In evaluating Applicant\u2019s case, I have considered the adjudicative process\nfactors listed in the Directive. I have also considered every finding of fact and conclusion discussed\nabove. \nApplicant was born in Taiwan, but followed her only brother to the United States in 1979,\nto further her education. She remained and became a U.S. citizen in 1993. She obtained a Taiwanese\npassport in 1996, thinking it would assist if she had to go to Taiwan should her mother become ill.\nShe realized she did not need a Taiwanese passport, never actually used it, and did not renew it after\nit expired in 2002. She has taken steps to formally renounce her Taiwanese citizenship. \nApplicant\u2019s only remaining connection to Taiwan is her elderly mother. Applicant would like\nher mother to immigrate to the U.S. Her mother is set in her ways and chooses to remain in Taiwan.\nShe lives off the rent from the apartment owned by Applicant\u2019s brother, with some assistance from\nApplicant and her brother.\nApplicant\u2019s brother and his wife are U.S. citizens and their two adult children were born here.\nLike Applicant, he is a successful engineer. Applicant has close ties to her community, particularly\nthrough her religious activities. She has substantial assets in the U.S., including her home. She is\nhighly regarded in her community and the workplace.\nTaiwan is an ally of the United States. However, Guideline B is not limited to countries\nhostile to the United States. \u201cThe United States has a compelling interest in protecting and\nsafeguarding classified information from any person, organization, or country that is not authorized\nto have access to it, regardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical\nto those of the United States.\u201d  The distinctions between friendly and unfriendly governments must\n30\nbe made with caution. Relations between nations can shift, sometimes dramatically and\nunexpectedly. \nFurthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the United States over\nmatters they view as important to their vital interests or national security. Finally, we know friendly\nnations have engaged in espionage against the United States, especially in the economic, scientific,\nand technical fields. Nevertheless, the nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the U.S.,\nand its human rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family\nmembers are vulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is\nsignificantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family member is\n\n11\nassociated with or dependent upon the government, or the country is known to conduct intelligence\noperations against the U.S.\nChina has an authoritarian government, a bad human rights record, and has a very aggressive\nespionage program. The U.S. officially supports the \u201cone China\u201d policy. However, to treat China and\nTaiwan the same is to ignore reality. They currently function as separate entities. That is not to say\nthat China is irrelevant to this case. China conducts intelligence operations in Taiwan. The threat to\nTaiwan from China is real. It is this threat that is the impetus to Taiwan\u2019s defense spending. It also\nprovides motivation for Taiwan\u2019s intelligence gathering. The threat from China also provides\nmotivation for Taiwan to keep the U.S. as a friend, as it is dependent on the U.S. for its arms and\ndefense. \nTaiwan is a democracy, does not have a poor human rights record, and is dependent upon the\nUnited States for arms, as well as its defense against China. Taiwan is known to conduct intelligence\noperations against the United States, but there is no indication that Taiwan utilizes coercion against\nits citizens for espionage purposes. Many of our allies conduct intelligence gathering against the U.S.\nTaiwan would be risking a great deal by raising the stakes, and attempting to use duress against one\nof its citizens in an attempt to coerce a U.S. citizen to commit espionage. Applicant\u2019s mother is also\nnot a good candidate for coercion. She is not dependent upon the government of Taiwan. She is\nstubborn. She did not inform Applicant or her brother that she had an operation, because she did not\nwant to bother them. Applicant has established that her mother in Taiwan does not create a\nheightened risk of foreign pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress. It is extremely unlikely that\nApplicant would ever have to choose between the interests of her mother or Taiwan, and the interests\nof the U.S.\nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions and evaluating all the evidence\nin the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns based\non foreign influence and foreign preference.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.

His more recent filings occurred\nin 2002 and 2003 under Chapter 13. Both cases were dismissed due to his failure to meet his\npayments under the plan. In 2004, his home was foreclosed and his automobile was repossessed. He\nhas not met his burden to mitigate the concerns raised under financial considerations. Clearance is\ndenied.\nSTATEMENT OF CASE\nOn November 9, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to\nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) stating they were unable to find that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance.  The SOR, which is in essence\n1\nthe administrative complaint, alleges security concerns under Guideline F, Financial Considerations\nof the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on December 29, 2005, and implemented by the\nDepartment of Defense effective September 1, 2006. \nOn December 19, 2006, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations.  Applicant elected to\nhave his case decided on the written record. Department Counsel submitted the government\u2019s file\nof relevant material (FORM) on January 9, 2007. The FORM was mailed to Applicant on January\n18, 2007, and received on January 24, 2007. Applicant was afforded an opportunity to file objections\nand submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant did not submit a response.\nThe case was assigned to me on March 22, 2007. \nPROCEDURAL ISSUES\nIt is not evident in the record that Applicant received a copy of the revised Adjudicative\nGuidelines, effective September 1, 2006.  On March 23, 2007, an order was issued directing\nDepartment Counsel to confirm Applicant received a copy of the revised adjudicative guidelines. \nOn March 29, 2007, Department Counsel confirmed Applicant had received a copy of the revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines. Department Counsel personally spoke with Applicant. Applicant had no\nfurther submissions for the record. \nDepartment Counsel submitted Items 5 and 6, Report of Investigation, Personal Subject\nInterviews, as part of the documentary evidence to support allegations in the SOR. These documents\nare unsworn, unsigned summaries of the interviews OPM conducted with Applicant on November\n17, 2005, and February 24, 2006.  Enclosure 3 of the Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance,\n \u00b6 E3.1.20, states in part: \u201cOfficial records or evidence compiled or created in the regular course of\nbusiness, other than DoD personnel background reports of investigation (ROI), may be received\nand considered by the Administrative Judge without authenticating witnesses \u2026 \u201d (emphasis added).\nIt goes on to say \u201cAn ROI may be received with an authenticating witness provided it is otherwise\n\n Item 3.\n2\n Item 2.\n3\n Item 3; questions 8 and 11; Item 4, question 9.\n4\n Item 7 at 1. \n5\n Items 10 and 11. \n6\n Items 12 and 13. \n7\n Item 15, 16, and 17.\n8\n Items 18, 19, and  20. \n9\n3\nadmissible under the Federal Rules of Evidence\u201d (emphasis added). The Government had the\nopportunity to request a hearing in order to call an authenticating witness.  I did not consider Items\n5 and 6 when making my decision based on \u00b6 E3.1.20 of the Directive.  \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant is 59 years-old and an employee of a defense contractor.

In his answer to the SOR, Applicant did not provide an update of his current\n12\nfinancial situation. He did admit that his wife spends approximately $140 to $240 per week\ngambling.  This is approximately $560 to $960 per month.\n13\n \nPOLICIES\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national\nsecurity and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position \u2026\nthat will give that person access to such information.\u201d  In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\n14\nClassified Information Within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), the President set out guidelines and\nprocedures for safeguarding classified information within the executive branch. \nTo be eligible for a security clearance, an applicant must meet the security guidelines\ncontained in the Directive.  The revised Adjudicative Guidelines, approved by the President on\nDecember 29, 2005 and implemented by the Department of Defense, effective September 1, 2006,\nsets forth personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating\nconditions under each guideline.  The adjudicative guideline at issue in this case is: \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations: Failure or inability to live within one's\nmeans, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control,\nlack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can\nraise questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect\nclassified information.  An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of\nhaving to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. Compulsive gambling is a concern\nas it may lead to financial crimes including espionage. Affluence that cannot be\nexplained by known sources of income is also a security concern. It may indicate\nproceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.15\n\n Revised AG, dated August 2006, \u00b6 2(a). \n16\n Id.\n17\n Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n18\n Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n19\nRevised AG, dated August 2006, \u00b6 2(b).\n20\n5\nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those\nwhich could mitigate security concerns pertaining to this adjudicative guideline, is set forth and\ndiscussed in the conclusions below.\n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is an acceptable security risk.\u201d   An administrative\n16\njudge must apply the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d and consider and carefully weigh the available,\nreliable information about the person.  An administrative judge should consider the following\nfactors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the\nconduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4)\nthe individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is\nvoluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7)\nthe motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and\n(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n17\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR\nthat disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to classified\ninformation.  Thereafter, the applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain,\n18\nextenuate, or mitigate the facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.  The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.19\n\u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified information will be\nresolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n20\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the\ngovernment.  The government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those\nindividuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  The decision to deny an individual\na security clearance is not a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant. It is merely an indication\nthat the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has established for issuing a\nclearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. The government\nhas established a prima facie case for disqualification under Guideline F.\nGuideline F - Financial Considerations\n\n6\nApplicant's poor financial history raises a security concern. He has encountered financial\nproblems since retiring from the military.  He received a bankruptcy discharge under Chapter 7 in\nJune 1992.  In November 2001, he received a bankruptcy discharge on November 15, 2001. Eight\nmonths later he filed another Chapter 13 bankruptcy. His case was dismissed in March 2003 for his\nfailure to make payments. He refiled a Chapter 13 bankruptcy in June 2003. His case was dismissed\non April 14, 2004, for failure to make payments on his payment plan.  Financial Considerations\nDisqualifying Condition (FC DC) 19(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and FC DC 19(c)\n(a history of not meeting financial obligations) apply to Applicant's case. \nFC DC 19(f) (financial problems that are linked to drug abuse, alcoholism, gambling\nproblems, or other issues of security concern) applies with regards to Applicant's spouse's gambling\nhabits. Applicant admits that his spouse spends approximately $140 to $240 a week on gambling.\nAfter his monthly expenses, Applicant and his wife have $730 left over each month.  If $560 to $960\nis spent towards gambling each month, very little is left to apply towards bills or if the greater amount\nis spent, Applicant and his wife spend more than they earn each month.  His wife's gambling habits\nhave an adverse impact on their household finances. For this reason, FC DC 19(f) applies. \nThe financial considerations concern can be mitigated.  I find that none of the mitigating\nconditions apply.  Since 1992, Applicant has filed for bankruptcy on four occasions.  His debts were\ndischarged in relation to his 1992 bankruptcy and his 1998 bankruptcy.  His most recent bankruptcy\nfilings under Chapter 13, were dismissed due to his failure to make payments towards his Chapter 13\nplan.  Applicant provided no evidence of financial counseling.  He provided no explanation or plan\nas to how he intends to make sure his debts are in control in the future.  His wife gambles a significant\namount of money relative to their household income. This raises a concern that Applicant will be\nunable to pay his debts in the future should an unforeseen circumstance arise.  Applicant's  financial\nhistory indicates a propensity to file for bankruptcy protection rather than attempting to resolve his\nfinancial issues. \nI considered all the evidence provided and also considered the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept in\nevaluating Applicant\u2019s risk and vulnerability in protecting our national interests. I find Applicant has\nfailed to mitigate the security concerns raised by the financial considerations concern. Therefore, I\nam persuaded by the totality of the evidence in this case, that it is not clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1\nGuideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.\nAgainst Applicant\n\n7\nSubparagraph 1.f.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h.\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

As of the date she answered the SOR, she had 10 accounts, totaling approximately $20,676\nthat have been delinquent for many years. Applicant\u2019s evidence is insufficient to show she is in\ncontrol of her finances, is not overextended, and that she has a track record of financial\nresponsibility. Furthermore, she deliberately falsified her application for a public trust position.\nEligibility for assignment to public-trust position is denied. \n\n  Government Exhibit (GE) 1.\n1\n  See Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960, as amended,\n2\nand Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Jan.\n2, 1992) (Directive), as amended. A memorandum from the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence\nand Security) to Director, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), dated November 19, 2004 states DOHA\nshall utilize provisions of the Directive to resolve contractor cases involving trustworthiness determinations. \n  Government Exhibit (GE) 2 (Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR).\n3\n  GE 4 (Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions (SF85P), dated December 8, 2004), unless indicated\n4\notherwise, is the source for the facts in this paragraph.\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn July 31, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts which raise security concerns under Guideline F\n(Financial Considerations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct).  The SOR informed Applicant of\n1\nthe reasons why DOHA recommends Applicant\u2019s case be submitted to an administrative judge for\na determination that she is not eligible to occupy an ADP I/II/III position.2\nOn September 8, 2006, Applicant answered the SOR (Answer).  She admitted the SOR\n3\nallegations under \u00b6\u00b61.a - 1.f, 1.h, and 1.i. She denied the allegations under \u00b6\u00b61.g, 1.j, and 2.a,\nprovided explanations, and requested a decision without a hearing. On January 10, 2007, Department\nCounsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM) which was mailed to Applicant on January\n12, 2007. She acknowledged receipt of the FORM on January 23, 2007, and did not object to\nanything contained in the FORM or submit additional information for consideration within the 30-\nday period provided to her. The case was assigned to me on March 22, 2007.\nPROCEDURAL ISSUES\nThe government moved to amend the SOR by deleting from its first paragraph the words\n\u201cparagraph 3-614, Department of Defense Regulation 5200.2-R and.\u201d The motion is granted\nwithout objection.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated herein as findings of facts.\nAfter a thorough review of the pleadings and the evidence, I make the following additional findings\nof facts:\nApplicant is a 26-year-old employee of a Department of Defense (DoD) contractor. She has\nworked for her current employer since December 2004.  She is single, and has a three-year-old\n4\ndaughter. There is no evidence Applicant has mishandled or compromised classified information\nwhile at her current job. \n\n  The information in this paragraph was gathered from the credit bureau reports GE 5-7. \n5\n4\nIn March 2004, Applicant submitted a Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions, Standard\nForm (SF) 85P. She answered \u201cNo\u201d to question 22b, and failed to list any debts that were more than\n180 days delinquent. The subsequent background investigation addressed Applicant\u2019s financial\nsituation and included the review of her December 2004 (GE 5), June 2006 (GE 6), and January\n2007 (GE 7) credit bureau reports (CBR). \nIn her September 2006 answers to the SOR (GE 2), Applicant admitted all the financial\nallegations with the exception of SOR \u00b6\u00b61.g and 1.j. Concerning \u00b6 1.g, she stated that if the debt\nconcerned a Master card or Visa credit card account she would admit it. Regarding \u00b61.j, she claimed\nto have no knowledge of the account and stated she would have to find information about it.\nConcerning \u00b62.a, she explained \u201cshe did not know the Federal government had anything to do with\ncredit cards.\u201d (GE 2) \nThe delinquent/charged off debts alleged in the SOR have the following collection assignment\nand/or charged off dates:  \u00b61.a - the collection assignment date was June 1999; \u00b61.b - the collection\n5\nassignment date was November 1999; \u00b61.c - the date of last action was June 2001 and the charged\noff date was February 2002; \u00b61.d - the date of last action was August 2001, with a charged off date\nof January 2002; \u00b61.e - the date of last action was June 2001; \u00b61.f - the date of last action was\nSeptember 2002; \u00b61.g - the date of last action was November 2001; \u00b61.h - the date of last action was\nJune 2002; \u00b61.i - the date of last action was November 2003; and \u00b61.j - the collection date was June\n2005.\nAccording to her SF 85P, she was employed from August 1996 to November 2003,\nunemployed from November 2003 to December 2004, and employed from December 2004 to the date\nof the hearing. She presented no evidence to show that she was taking care of/resolving her debts in\nthe form of canceled checks, receipts of payments, and settlement agreements with creditors. Nor did\nshe present evidence to explain how she acquired her debts; why they became delinquent; what\ncircumstances beyond her control, if any, prevented her from paying her delinquent debts; what\nefforts, if any, she has taken to pay, settle, or resolve the debts; the status of her current financial\nsituation; or whether she has participated in financial counseling; or whether she has taken any\nmeasures to avoid future financial problems. \nPOLICIES\nThe Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be considered in evaluating an\nApplicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position. The administrative judge must take into account\nboth disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative guideline applicable to the facts\nand circumstances of the case. The guidelines are not viewed as inflexible ironclad rules of law. The\npresence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative of a conclusion\nfor or against an Applicant. Each decision must reflect a fair and impartial common sense\nconsideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3 of the Directive, and the whole person concept.\n\n  Directive, \u00b6 E2.A6.1.1.\n6\n  Directive, \u00b6 E2.A5.1.1.\n7\n  See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\n8\n  ISCR Case No. 98-0761, at p. 2 (December 27, 1999)(Substantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but less\n9\nthan a preponderance of the evidence.); ISCR Case No. 02-12199, at p. 3  (April 3, 2006)(Substantial evidence is such\nrelevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary\nevidence in the record.); Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.\n  Egan, 484 U.S. 518, at 528, 531.\n10\n  See Egan; Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.2.\n11\n  Directive, \u00b6 E2.A6.1.1.\n12\n5\nHaving considered the record evidence as a whole, I conclude Guideline F (Financial Considerations)6\nand Guideline E (Personal Conduct)  are the applicable relevant adjudicative guidelines.\n7\nBURDEN OF PROOF\nThe purpose of a security clearance decision is to resolve whether it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to consider an applicant suitable for a public trust position.  A person who holds\n8\na public trust position enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and\nconfidence. The government, therefore, has a compelling interest to ensure each applicant possesses\nthe requisite judgement, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests\nas his or her own. \nThe government has the initial burden of proving controverted facts alleged in the SOR. To\nmeet its burden, the government must establish by substantial evidence  a prima facie case that it is\n9\nnot clearly consistent with the national interest for the applicant to have access to classified\ninformation. The responsibility then shifts to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the\ngovernment's case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the applicant carries a heavy\nburden of persuasion.  The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution\n10\nof any reasonable doubt about an applicant's suitability for access to classified information in favor\nof protecting national security.  The same rules apply in trustworthiness determinations.\n11\nCONCLUSIONS\nUnder Guideline F (Financial Considerations), a security concern exists when a person has\nsignificant unpaid debts. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk to engage in illegal\nor unethical acts to generate funds to meet financial obligations.  Similarly, an individual who is\n12\nfinancially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in his/her obligation to\nprotect classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life can often\nindicate how a person may behave in other aspects of life.\n\n  Directive, \u00b6 E2.A6.1.3.3.\n13\n  Directive, \u00b6 E2.A5.1.1.\n14\n6\nIt was Applicant\u2019s responsibility to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government's allegations\nagainst her. She failed to provide sufficient evidence to do so. Based on the limited evidence\nprovided, I conclude that as of January 2007 (the day she acknowledged receipt of the FORM)\nApplicant had 10 delinquent/charged off accounts that are still outstanding, owing approximately\n$20,676. Applicant\u2019s financial problems are recent, not isolated, and ongoing. Applicant\u2019s\nunwillingness or inability to honor her financial obligations is evidenced by the delinquent debts she\nhas been carrying for years, and her failure to show meaningful efforts to repay creditors or otherwise\nresolve her financial situation. Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC)\nE2.A6.1.2.1: A history of not meeting financial obligations; and FC DC E2.A6.1.2.3: Inability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts, apply in this case. \nIn January 2007, Applicant was provided with a copy of the FORM in which the government\nstrongly argued that Applicant had failed to demonstrate she had resolved the debts alleged in the\nSOR, that she was financially solvent, that she had a track record of financial responsibility, and/or\nthat circumstances beyond her control mitigated her financial condition. Notwithstanding the\ngovernment\u2019s concerns, Applicant did not answer the FORM and failed to provide documents to\nmitigate the concerns. \nApplicant raised facts that may be considered as circumstances beyond her control, i.e., her\n13 months period of unemployment. Notwithstanding, under the totality of the circumstances of her\ncase, Applicant failed to provide sufficient information to support the applicability of Financial\nConsiderations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC) 3: the conditions that resulted in the behavior were\nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business turndown).  Applicant\n13\nfailed to provide sufficient information to support the applicability of any of the Financial\nConsiderations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC).\nApplicant\u2019s evidence is not sufficient to show she has dealt responsibly with her financial\nobligations. She presented no evidence of meaningful efforts taken to resolve her debts before receipt\nof the SOR (i.e., paid debts, settlements, negotiations, payment plans, budgets, financial\nassistance/counseling). She failed to present sufficient evidence to show she is not overextended or\nthat her financial problems will not be a concern in the future. Applicant\u2019s financial history and lack\nof favorable evidence preclude a finding that she has established a track record of financial\nresponsibility. Applicant\u2019s available evidence is not sufficient to demonstrate she has taken control\nof her financial situation and is capable of overcoming her financial difficulties. \nUnder Guideline E, personal conduct is always a security concern because it asks the ultimate\nquestion \u2013 whether a person\u2019s past conduct instills confidence the person can be trusted to properly\nsafeguard classified information. An applicant's conduct is a security concern if it involves\nquestionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness\nto comply with rules and regulations. Such behavior could indicate that the person may not properly\nsafeguard classified information.14\n\n7\nThe government established that Applicant failed to disclose the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b61.a -\n1.i in her response to SF 85P question 22b. Applicant\u2019s explanation in her answer to SOR \u00b62.a (that\nshe did not know that the Federal government had anything to do with credit cards), in addition to her\nage, level of education, employment, the number and value of her debts, and the fact that she acquired\nthe debts, convinces me she deliberately failed to disclose the delinquent debts. It is not likely that\nshe could have forgotten all of her delinquent debts. Furthermore, Applicant clearly demonstrated a\nlack of interest in establishing her financial responsibility. Considering all the available evidence in\nthis case, I find Applicant did intend to falsify her SF 86 and to mislead the government. Personal\nConduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) E2.A5.1.2.2: the deliberate omission, concealment, or\nfalsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal\nhistory statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness,\nor award fiduciary responsibilities, applies.\nI carefully considered the applicability of all the Personal Conduct Mitigating Conditions and\nconclude that none apply. The evidence available in this case is not sufficient to support the\napplicability of any of the mitigating conditions. \nI have carefully weighed all evidence, and I applied the disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions as listed under the applicable adjudicative guidelines. I specifically considered Applicant\u2019s\nanswer to the SOR, and the fact that there is no evidence that she ever mishandled or caused the\ncompromise of classified information. Considering all available information, and the whole person\nconcept, I find Applicant has not mitigated the Financial Considerations and Personal Conduct\nsecurity concerns.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings regarding each SOR allegation as required by Directive Section E3.1.25 are\nas follows:\nParagraph 1, Financial Considerations (Guideline F)\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.j \nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Personal Conduct (Guideline E)\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a \nAgainst Applicant\n\n8\nDECISION\n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for assignment to a public-trust\nposition. Eligibility is denied.\nJuan J. Rivera\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Eligibility for a position of trust is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF CASE\nOn August 24, 2004, Applicant submitted an application for a position of public trust, an\nADP I/II/III position. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant the\napplication under Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (the \u201cDirective\u201d).  On October 24, 2006,\n1\nDOHA issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), detailing why it could not make the\npreliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue eligibility for a public trust position. Specifically, the SOR, which is in\nessence the administrative complaint, alleged security concerns arising under Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations) of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on December 29, 2005 and\nimplemented by the Department of Defense, effective September 1, 2006. DOHA recommended the\ncase be referred to an administrative judge to determine whether eligibility for a position of trust\nshould be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.\nIn a sworn statement dated December 19, 2006, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations\nand requested a hearing. DOHA assigned this case to me on February 8, 2007, and issued a notice of\nhearing on March 2, 2007. At the hearing on March 21, 2007, Applicant waived her right to receive\nthe notice of the hearing 15 days prior to the hearing date. I conducted the hearing as scheduled.  The\n2\ngovernment submitted five exhibits (GE) which were marked and admitted into the record as GE 1-5,\nwithout objection. Applicant submitted 17 exhibits (App Ex), which were marked and admitted as\nApp Ex A-Q, without objection. Applicant testified on her own behalf. I held the record open until\nApril 11, 2007 for the submission of additional evidence. Applicant timely submitted five additional\nexhibits, which are marked and admitted as App Ex R-V, without objection. DOHA received the\nhearing transcript (Tr.) on April 10, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\n\nApplicant\u2019s response to the SOR, dated December19, 2006.\n3\nGE 1 (Applicant\u2019s Questionnaire for a Position of Public Trust) at 1, 3.\n4\nId.; Tr. at 43-46.\n5\nApp Ex E (Medical progress note on husband, dated April 25, 2003) at 1;Tr. at 46-47.\n6\nApp Ex D (Letter, dated April 28, 2003) at 1-3; App Ex E, supra note 6; Tr. at 42, 51.\n7\nTr. at 54-56.\n8\n3\nIn her SOR response, Applicant admits to all the SOR allegations under Guideline F, but\ndenies the overall concern.  Applicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated herein. In addition, after a\n3\nthorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings\nof fact.\nApplicant, a 38-year-old woman and high school graduate, works as a claims associate for a\nDepartment of Defense contractor, and seeks a position of public trust. She has worked for her\nemployer for more than eight years.4\nIn July 1995, at age 26, Applicant married a man 12 years her senior. In 1996, her husband\nsustained an on-the-job injury to his shoulder. His employer lacked workers compensation insurance,\nleaving them to pay the bills. Her husband stopped working and began disappearing from home two-\nfour days a week. He always told her some reason for his absence. She eventually learned that he was\naddicted to cocaine. She also realized that he had started writing and signing checks with her name.5\nIn 1998, Applicant transferred jobs and moved with her husband to another city. Her husband\nentered a drug rehabilitation program, which she funded, and he completed eight months later. In\n2002, her husband began disappearing from home for days at a time. When she returned home after\nattending an out-of-town seminar, she discovered that her husband had taken all the money out of\ntheir joint checking account, leaving her with no funds to pay bills. In the house, she found evidence\nof cocaine use and documents from his doctors. After reviewing these documents, she realized that\nhe was addicted to pain pills and that he was most likely using cocaine again.6\nOn April 28, 2003, the State Solicitor for the county where Applicant lived notified her\nhusband that he had been accepted into a Pre-Trial Intervention program, which included random drug\ntesting. Her husband paid the participation fee of $250, but did not complete the program. She\ndecided not to pay for a second drug treatment program and to end her marriage. She moved home\n30 days later, after her employer granted her request for a transfer. She has not seen her husband since\nshe left him in May 2003. She last had contact with him in December 2003. She does not know where\nhe is, and cannot divorce him.7\nDuring her marriage, her estranged husband opened joint checking accounts, then depleted\nall the funds in the accounts. She finally opened an account in her name and had her paycheck\ndeposited in the account. Once she did this, he no longer used her earnings to pay for his drug habit.8\n\nApp Ex R (Applicant\u2019s federal tax return for 2004); App Ex S (Applicant\u2019s federal tax return for 2005); App\n9\nEx T (Applicant\u2019s federal tax return for 2006); Tr. at 57, 60.\nApp Ex U (Applicant\u2019s wage and earnings statements from December 22, 2006 through March 30, 2007); GE\n10\n2 (Applicant\u2019s answers to interrogatories, dated September 6, 2006) at 9; Tr. at 65.\nSOR at 1-3; GE 3 ( Credit report, dated October 14, 2004); GE 4 (Credit report, dated June 14, 2006); GE\n11\n5 (Credit report, dated February 7, 2007); App Ex.

However, in 2006,\nshe earned only $19,677 because she took time from work to care for her sick, elderly father,\nfollowing two brain surgeries. She continues to provide care for him, using the provisions of the\nFamily and Medical Leave Act to account for her unpaid and unscheduled absences from work.9\nWhen she works full-time, she earns approximately $2,300.00 in gross monthly income, and\nher net monthly income is approximately $1,617.00. Her monthly expenses total approximately\n$1,625, including repairs to her old car. With her income, she can pay her bills. She does not use\ncredit cards for purchases, only her debt card when cash is available. In the last three months, her\nmonthly income has been significantly less than normal because of the time she has missed from work\nwhile caring for her father. Her parents have been assisting her with payment of her bills.10\nThe SOR lists 19 delinquent and unpaid debts, totaling $27,145. All of these debts are more\nthan three years old, except the $1,620 bank overdraft debt in allegation 1.j, the $258 personal loan\nin allegation 1.l and the $1,100 credit card debt in allegation 1.p. Applicant established that until\n2001, she regularly and timely paid on her credit debt. When her estranged husband took all the\nfinancial assets to pay for his restarted drug habit, she lacked sufficient funds to pay all the bills. She\npaid the essentials, such as rent, utilities and food, when she could. She asked her estranged husband\nto sign over to her a car titled in both names. He refused and requested that she give the car to him.\nShe declined because she did not want him driving a car with her name on the title when he may be\non drugs and could cause harm to others for which she would be responsible. She requested the\nnoteholder to take the car on a voluntary repossession, but it could not do so because her husband\nneeded to sign the title. The noteholder involuntarily repossessed the car, after she told them where\nto find it.11\nApplicant has not paid any of her delinquent debts nor has she made any arrangements to pay\nthese debts because she lacks the payment funds. She recently participated in an employer sponsored\nprogram on ways to resolve and control debt. She is considering filing bankruptcy to eliminate her\nolder debts.12\nApplicant\u2019s former employer states that \u201cHer unsurpassed customer service expertise coupled\nwith her precise bookkeeping skills quickly made her a valued asset.\u201d She would not question\nApplicant\u2019s integrity and would rehire her at any time. Applicant lives a simple life and does not want\nto change it. She drives a 14-year-old car.13\n\n Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 527 (1988).  \n14\n Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.1.\n15\n Id.\n16\n Id.\n17\n5\nPOLICIES\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national\nsecurity and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position \u2026 that\nwill give that person access to such information.\u201d  In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\n14\nClassified Information Within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), the President set out guidelines and\nprocedures for safeguarding classified information and determining trustworthiness within the\nexecutive branch. \nTo be eligible for a security clearance or access to sensitive information, an applicant must\nmeet the security guidelines contained in the Directive. Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth\npersonnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions under\neach guideline. The adjudicative guideline at issue in this case are: \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations - An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal or unethical acts to generate\nfunds to meet financial obligations. Similarly, an individual who is financially\nirresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligation\nto protect classified or sensitive information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly\nin one aspect of life provides an indication of how a person may behave in other\naspects of life.\nConditions that could raise a trustworthiness concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those\nwhich could mitigate security concerns pertaining to this adjudicative guideline, are set forth and\ndiscussed in the conclusions below.\nThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.  An administrative\n15\njudge must apply the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d and consider and carefully weigh the available, reliable\ninformation about the person.  An administrative judge should consider the following factors: (1) the\n16\nnature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to\ninclude knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the\npresence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for\nthe conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of\ncontinuation or recurrence.17\n\n Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n18\n Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n19\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. December 19, 2002).\n20\n Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.2.\n21\n6\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR that\ndisqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.18\nThereafter, the applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate the facts.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent\n19\nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d  Any doubt as to whether\n20\naccess to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor\nof the national security.  The same rules apply to trustworthiness determinations for access to\n21\nsensitive positions.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. The government\nhas established a prima facie case for disqualification under Guideline F - Financial Considerations.\nFinancial Considerations\nUnder Guideline F, the \u201cfailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by\nrules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness\nand ability to protect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk\nof having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\u201d (AG \u00b6 18.) The credit reports reflect numerous\nold, unpaid debts. Because of the age of these debts and their delinquent status, Applicant showed an\ninability or unwillingness to pay her debts. Based on the evidence of record, the government\nestablished the applicability of Disqualifying condition (DC) \u00b6 19 (a) inability or unwillingness to\nsatisfy debts and DC \u00b6 19 (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\nApplicant left her husband in May 2003. She last contacted him in December 2003. Since then,\nshe has not been in contact with her estranged husband and does not know where he is. She has no\nintent to continue her relationship with him, and would divorce him if she could locate him. Because\nshe wanted to stop his theft of her earnings, she opened a checking account in her name only, and\ndirected that her paycheck be sent to this account. By so doing, she denied her estranged husband\naccess to her money. She does not use credit cards anymore. She limits herself to using her debt card\nto pay for her purchases. Mitigating Condition (MC) \u00b6 20(a) the behavior . . . occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to reoccur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment applies because her estranged husband can no longer\nuse her earnings to fund his drug habit. She can, and does, pay her monthly bills.\nOne year after her marriage, Applicant\u2019s husband sustained an injury. He managed the pain\nwith cocaine. Although he successfully completed a drug rehabilitation program in 1998, within four\n\nThe remaining financial considerations mitigating condition set forth in AG 20 (f) does  not apply in this case.\n22\nSee ISCR Case No. 04-07360 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 26, 2006) (stating partial credit was available under FCMC\n23\n6 for debts being resolved through garnishment). \n7\nyears, Applicant\u2019s husband had become addicted to pain killers and had started using cocaine again.\nTo support his habits, he stole all the household money, leaving no money to pay bills. His continual\ntheft of household income made it impossible for her to pay all their bills. She paid what and when she\ncould. After a year of his behavior, Applicant left him. More recently, she has assumed significant\nresponsibility for the care of her elderly father after brain surgery, which has required her to take\nunpaid leave from work. MC \u00b6 26 (b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were\nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected\nmedical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the\ncircumstances applies. The evidence reflects that she acted responsibly under the circumstances.\nRecently, Applicant enrolled in a credit counseling course sponsored by her employer to learn\nhow to resolve these credit problems. She is looking into bankruptcy. Since she has not actually filed\nfor bankruptcy, this fact is entitled to little weight. MC \u00b6 20 (c) the person has received or is receiving\ncounseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or\nis under control has some applicability.\nApplicant has not paid any of her debts and has not made any effort to develop a payment plan\nwith her creditor. MC \u00b6 20 (d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors\nor otherwise resolve debts does not apply. \nIn her response, Applicant disputes the debts alleged in paragraphs 1.e, 1.f, 1.j, and 1.r of the\nSOR. She has not provided documentation that she formally disputed these debts with the credit\nreporting agencies. Thus, MC \u00b6 20 (e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy\nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate\nthe basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue does not apply.22\nShe does, however, receive some credit in the whole person analysis, infra, for the application\nof the 3-year State statute of limitations, which applies to SOR allegations 1.a - 1.I, 1.k, 1.m, 1.n, 1.q,\nand 1.r, which are primarily credit card debts, unpaid personal loans, and telephone bills. See State\nCode. Ann. \u00a7 15-3-530.  The Court of Appeals succinctly explained the societal and judicial value\n23\nof application of the statute of limitations:\nStatutes of limitations embody important public policy considerations in that they\nstimulate activity, punish negligence and promote repose by giving security and\nstability to human affairs. The cornerstone policy consideration underlying statutes of\nlimitations is the laudable goal of law to promote and achieve finality in litigation.\nSignificantly, statutes of limitations provide potential defendants with certainty that\nafter a set period of time, they will not be ha[led] into court to defend time-barred\nclaims. Moreover, limitations periods discourage plaintiffs from sitting on their rights.\nStatutes of limitations are, indeed, fundamental to our judicial system.\n\nSee ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd. June 28, 2006).\n24\n8\nCarolina Marine Handling, Inc. v. Lasch, 609 S.E.2d 548, 552 (Ct. App. 2005) (internal quotation\nmarks and citations omitted).\nElimination of 90% of her delinquent debt through the statute of limitations has ended her\npotential vulnerability to improper financial inducements to pay these debts because she is no longer\n\u201cfinancially overextended\u201d, but it does not negate her past conduct in not paying her outstanding debts.\nWhole Person Analysis\nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The\nobjective of the trustworthy determination process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a\nperson\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for assignment to sensitive\nduties. Indeed, the adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in considering\nthe \u201cwhole person\u201d concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of her acts,\nomissions, motivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful\nanalysis.\nApplicant married a man who developed a cocaine habit and later became dependent on pain\nkillers. For a number of years, she paid her bills. She also financed a drug rehabilitation program for\nher estranged husband. However, in 2002, he returned to his drug use and began severely depleting\nthe funds in their joint banking accounts to pay for his drug habits. She managed to pay some basic\nliving expenses, but could not pay many of her now delinquent bills. She allowed a car to be\nrepossessed before she would permit her estranged husband to have it because she feared the harm he\ncould cause should he drive while high on drugs, a very likely occurrence. She left him because she\nrealized he would not resolve his drug problem, and did not want to be a part of the problems created\nas a result of his addiction. She ended her relationship with him almost four years ago. Since then, the\nnumber of delinquent debts have declined. For the last two and one-half years, she has paid her current\nbills and lived within her financial means. She cares for her elderly father, using unpaid leave under\nthe Family and Medical Leave Act. Her work ethic, skills and integrity are support by her continuous\nemployment and the statement of her former employer. Her estranged husband\u2019s drug habits created\nserious financial problems for her. These problems will not occur in the future because he is out of her\nlife and will not be allowed back into her life. She lives quietly and simply, and has no desire to change\nher lifestyle. Although she has not paid her debts, there is very little likelihood that she will engage\nin illegal acts to generate funds, particularly since she did not compromise her employer\u2019s sensitive\ninformation during her time of severe financial distress to pay her bills after her husband deleted the\nbank accounts. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and\ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person,  I conclude she has mitigated the trustworthiness\n24\nconcerns pertaining to her finances. \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\n\n9\nSOR \u00b6 1-Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs a-r:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the evidence presented in this case, it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for assignment to sensitive duties.

Applicant, a 26-year-old man, seeks a position of public trust. He has worked in enrollment and data entry for a Department of Defense contractor for almost two years. He was unemployed for two months in 2005 and previously worked as an entertainer, as a loan officer, and as a collector for a credit corporation and for collection services. He is a high school graduate. He is not married. 3 (Exhibit 1, Public Trust Position Application; TR 24-27; 32-35) Financial Considerations Applicant explained his financial problems began in October 2001 when he totaled his car and lost his job as he had no transportation. However, he did not declare this unemployment in his security form under his employment history. As he did not have gap insurance, he also owed for the car. In addition, he had to finance another vehicle to get to work. (TR 16-17; 27-31) He stated he incurred more debt when he was in a relationship with his girlfriend for two years.

With this history of not paying his bills and his failure to\ndevelop a plan to resolve them,  Applicant failed to mitigate the government\u2019s concerns under\nGuideline F.  Eligibility for trustworthiness is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant\u2019s\napplication for a public trust position under Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (the\n\"Directive\").  On December 29, 2006, DOHA issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR)\n1\ndetailing the basis for its decision based on the revised (\u201cnew\u201d) Adjudicative Guidelines  issued on\n2\nDecember 29, 2005, and implemented by the Department of Defense, effective September 1, 2006.\nThe SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). On February 12,\n2007, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a hearing. \nDOHA assigned this case to me on March 28, 2007.  The Notice of Hearing issued on March\n30, 2007, set the date for April 18, 2007.  Applicant received it on April 2, 2007, which gave him\n15 days notice of the hearing.  At the hearing,  conducted as scheduled, the government submitted\nfive exhibits (Exhibits 1-5), which were admitted into the record without objection. Applicant\nsubmitted no exhibits, but testified on his own behalf. The record was held open for two weeks until\nMay 2, 2007, (TR 53, 61-62) to allow Applicant to submit further documents, which he failed to do.\nDOHA received the hearing transcript (TR) on April 27, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nIn the SOR response, Applicant admitted  to SOR allegations 1.a., 1.b., 1.c, 1.d, 1.e., 1.f.,\n3\n1.g., 1.h., 1.i., 1.k, and 1.l under Guideline F, but denied 1.j.  under Guideline F.  Applicant\u2019s\nadmissions are incorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough and careful review of the pleadings,\nexhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.\nApplicant, a 26-year-old man, seeks a position of public trust.  He has worked in enrollment\nand data entry for a Department of Defense contractor for almost two years. He was unemployed for\ntwo months in 2005 and previously worked as an entertainer, as a loan officer, and as a collector for\na credit corporation and for collection services.  He is a high school graduate. He is not married.\n\n3\n(Exhibit 1, Public Trust Position Application; TR 24-27; 32-35)\nFinancial Considerations\nApplicant explained his financial problems began in October 2001 when he totaled his car\nand lost his job as he had no transportation.  However, he did not declare this unemployment in his\nsecurity form under his employment history.  As he did not have gap insurance, he also owed for the\ncar.  In addition, he had to finance another vehicle to get to work.  (TR 16-17; 27-31)  He stated he\nincurred more debt when he was in a relationship with his girlfriend for two years.  (TR 17) \nOn his initial application Applicant documented that he had 180-day delinquencies to a health\nclub incurred in July 2000 and a credit card debt.  (Exhibit 1) He claimed he did not know he had\nso many debts until he received his credit reports.  (TR 20) A review of Applicant\u2019s credit reports\nfrom July 2005 (Exhibit 3), June 2006 (Exhibit 4), March 2007 (Exhibit 5) as well as his admissions\nto the SOR show twelve unpaid debts totaling over $16,000. In his answers to Interrogatories\nsubmitted in November 2006, he stated he disputed one debt and disputed a fine of $101 for parking\ntickets to a university where he visited the campus, but had not attended.  The income he earns just\ncovers his expenses of $1,430. He stated he was unable to make any payments on his debts as he\nneeded \u201cto get my finances in order\u201d to resolve the matters.  While  in November 2006 he stated he\nplanned to pay off the small debts with his tax return, he provided no evidence he did so.  (Exhibit\n2)  The current status of these debts is as follows:\nSOR \u00b6\nTYPE OF DEBT (date)\nAMOUNT\nCURRENT STATUS\n1.a\nCollection account for a\nhealth club loan. (2004)\n$     3,946.00\nUnpaid; he believes this debt\nis the same as 1.l, but he\nprovided no documentation\nto establish they were the\nsame debt. (TR 20; 51-53)\n1.b.\nJewelry store.  (2000)\n$       724.00\nUnpaid. (TR 54-55)\n1.c\nCollection account in\nregard to a vehicle.\n(2004)\n$    2,468.00\nUnpaid. (TR 47-49; 55-56)\n1.d\nCollection account for a\nvehicle.

(2006)\n$    101.00\nUnpaid.  While he disputed\nthis debt as he never received\na  parking ticket, he has not\ncontested the ticket.\n(Answer; Exhibits 2, 3, 4;\nTR 21, 44-47)  \n1.k\nCollection account for\nlibrary bill.  (2006)\n$       80.00\nUnpaid. (TR 59)\n1.l\nCollection account for\ncredit card.  (2006)\n$   3, 447.00\nUnpaid; While he believes\nthis debt is the same as 1.a.,\nhe provided no\ndocumentation.  (TR 20; 59-\n60)\n Initially, he believed he could handle his arrangements with each debtor himself but has not\ndone so as he has not had the financial resources to offer a settlement.  Applicant would like to\nconsult a credit counseling agency to \u201csquare away\u201d his credit and go over each account, but he has\nnot done so. (TR 21-22; 37-39)  He has paperwork from various creditors but \u201cpersonally can\u2019t sort\nit out.\u201d He does not know how to go about it.  (TR 49-50)  He has discussed his financial problems\nwith his mother, but his only asset is his vehicle.  (TR 39-41) \nApplicant moved home with his parents in May 2006 to reduce expenses.  (TR 23)  He pays\nhis mother $300 per month rent.  He has paid for his vehicle.  He testified his only expense is for his\ncell phone of $50 and insurance of $90.  He currently makes $12.50 per hour and earns $816 every\ntwo weeks.  (TR 41-44)\nPOLICIES\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national\nsecurity and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position \u2026\nthat will give that person access to such information.\u201d  In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\n4\nClassified Information Within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), the President set out guidelines and\nprocedures for safeguarding classified information and determining trustworthiness within the\nexecutive branch. To be eligible for a security clearance or access to sensitive information, an\napplicant must meet the security guidelines contained in the Directive. Enclosure 2 of the Directive\n\n Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.1.\n5\n Id.\n6\n Id.\n7\n Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n8\n Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n9\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. December 19, 2002).\n10\n Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.2.\n11\n5\nsets forth personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating\nconditions under each guideline.  Conditions that could raise a trustworthiness concern and may be\ndisqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security concerns pertaining to these\nadjudicative guidelines, are set forth and discussed in the conclusions below.\n\"The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.  An administrative\n5\njudge must apply the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d and consider and carefully weigh the available,\nreliable information about the person.  An administrative judge should consider the following\n6\nfactors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the\nconduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4)\nthe individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation;\n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the\nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9)\nthe likelihood of continuation or recurrence.   \n7\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR\nthat disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to classified\ninformation.  Thereafter, the applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain,\n8\nextenuate, or mitigate the facts.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is\n9\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d  Any doubt\n10\nas to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be\nresolved in favor of the national security.  The same rules apply to trustworthiness determinations\n11\nfor access to sensitive positions.\nCONCLUSIONS\nFinancial Considerations\nGuideline F - Financial Considerations - An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal or unethical acts to generate\nfunds to meet financial obligations. Similarly, an individual who is financially\nirresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their\nobligation to protect classified or sensitive information. Behaving responsibly or\n\n6\nirresponsibly in one aspect of life provides an indication of how a person may\nbehave in other aspects of life.\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. The government\nestablished a prima facie case for disqualification under Guideline F, Financial Considerations. Based\non all the evidence, AG \u00b6 19(a), (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and \u00b6 19(c), (a history\nof not meeting financial obligations) apply to Applicant's case. Applicant has many unpaid,\ndelinquent debts and did not demonstrate any effort to resolve them.\nWith the government\u2019s case established, the burden shifted to Applicant to present evidence\nof refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against him. I considered the Financial\nConsiderations Mitigating Conditions (MC) but none apply sufficiently to mitigate concerns.  He still\ncarries a significant amount of outstanding delinquent debts for a variety of bills which he incurred\nover several years.  AG \u00b6 20(b)  (The conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond\nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency,\nor a death, divorce, or separation)) applies in part due to his 2001 accident. However, AG \u00b6 20 (a),\n(the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that\nit is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness,\nor good judgment) does not apply as Applicant has had over six years to address these debts and has\ntaken no documented steps other than to reduce his expenses by moving home in 2006 to save on rent.\nAlthough he initially stated an intent to use his income tax refund, Applicant did not to so even to pay\nany of the small debts he acknowledges.   \nMost significantly, he does not meet AG \u00b6 20(c), (the person has received or is receiving\ncounseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or\nis under control).  When unable to address his debt personally or with his mother\u2019s help, Applicant\nfailed to contact a credit counseling agency to help settle his credit problems or to challenge any of\nthe debts listed on the credit report.  Also, he did not establish that he pays his current bills timely or\nthat he has not incurred any significant new delinquent debt.\nBecause of these failures of proof, Applicant has not demonstrated he has met AG \u00b6 20(d),\n(the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts).\nWhile he has a position with only a modest income, his promise to pay in the future is not sufficient\nto mitigate the financial considerations concern. For example, in November 2006, Applicant had\npromised to use a tax return to pay some of the smaller debts, but in April 2007 he did not show that\nhe had done so. He entered into no payment plans with any creditor or demonstrated he had made\neven one payment. Thus, he has not established he continually and timely makes any payments.  He\nhas limited expenses, but has not allocated any of his resources to resolve this persistent issue of\nunpaid his debts.\nWhole Person Analysis\nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The\nobjective of the trustworthy determination process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of\na person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for assignment to\nsensitive duties. Indeed, the adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in\nconsidering the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality\n\nSee ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd. June 28, 2006).\n12\n7\nof their acts, omissions, motivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own\nmerits, taking into consideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature\nthinking, and careful analysis.  Ironically, he was worked in the past as a debt collector, but did not\ntap any of that expertise to resolve his own financial problems.  Applicant's lengthy history of failing\nto meet his financial obligations, and inability or unwillingness to satisfy his debts raises serious\ntrustworthiness concerns. At 26 years old, he is sufficiently mature to be fully responsible for his\nconduct. Given his limited income, he had to make choices about how to use his limited resources.\nBut all of the 12 SOR debts remain unpaid. \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and\ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person,  I conclude he has failed to mitigate the\n12\ntrustworthiness concerns pertaining to financial considerations.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nSOR \u00b6 1-Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs a-l:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the evidence presented in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant Applicant eligibility for assignment to sensitive duties for a public trust\nposition.

Department Counsel submitted the\nGovernment's written case (FORM) on or about March 2, 2007. Applicant did not file a response to\nthe FORM. The case was assigned to me on May 24, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant is a 46 year old employee of a defense contractor.\nSOR Allegation 1a: Applicant is indebted to this creditor in the approximate amount of\n$1,418.00.

He further stated \u201cI will assure\n1\nyou that it is my intention to pay all this debt over the next 18 months.\u201d\nIn his response to the SOR, applicant stated he intends to pay off one of his delinquent debts\nin November, another one in January, and then continuing paying them off one by one until all five\nare paid.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe evidence establishes that applicant has five debts, totaling $14,536.00, that have been\npast-due for many years. Applicant\u2019s failure to honor his financial obligations  reflects adversely on\nhis judgment and reliability, and suggests he cannot be relied upon to safeguard classified\ninformation. Disqualifying Conditions E2.A6.1.2.1 (a history of not meeting financial obligations)\nand E2.A6.1.2.3 (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) are applicable.\nOnce the Government established a prima facie case under Guideline F, the burden shifted\nto applicant to show he has reformed. Applicant failed to meet his burden. Although on at least two\noccasions he stated he intended to begin addressing the five credit card debts, he offered no credible\nevidence that he (1) has followed through with his stated intention and taken any meaningful action\nto address any of them, (2) is in a position to significantly reduce this past-due indebtedness anytime\nsoon, or (2) is unlikely to experience additional financial difficulties.

Clearance is granted.  \n       \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn May 2, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement\nof Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating that DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative\n\nRequired by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive),\n1\ndated January 2, 1992, as amended.\n2\nfinding  it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for\n1\nApplicant. The SOR set forth reasons why a security clearance could not be granted or continued\ndue to financial considerations security concerns.\nOn June 11, 2007, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing. On August 23,\n2007, I was assigned the case. On August 29, 2007, a Notice of Hearing was issued for the hearing\nheld on September 20, 2007. At the hearing, the Government presented eight exhibits (Gov Ex).\nApplicant testified and submitted five exhibits (App Ex). The record was kept open to allow\nApplicant to submit additional documents, which were received on September 24, 2007.\nDepartment Counsel having no objections to the three sets of documents, the documents were\nadmitted as App Ex F. On September 28, 2007, DOHA received the transcript (Tr.). \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe SOR alleges security concerns for financial considerations. Applicant admits owing\neleven of the debts and denies the remainder. The admissions are incorporated herein as findings\nof fact. After a thorough review of the entire record, I make the following findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 44-year-old who has worked overseas for a defense contractor since October\n2005, and is seeking to obtain a security clearance. Applicant\u2019s supervisor indicates Applicant is a\nself-motivated individual who performs tasks flawlessly. Applicant displays a \u201ccan do\u201d attitude that\nputs him a cut above his peers. (App Ex F 9) \nApplicant enlisted in the U.S. Army in June 1982 and was discharged in November 2005 as\nan E-7 with a 50% medical disability. Copies of his DD 214 and other military documents are found\nat App Ex F 13. He receives $2,200 per month in retirement. (Tr. 42, App Ex F-12) Applicant was\ndeployed overseas 15 months as a soldier and 15 months as a government contractor. (App Ex F 14)\nAfter returning from overseas, while in the Army, Applicant learned his mortgage  payments were\nnot received for four months.  Applicant sent the mortgage company a $55,000 money order. (App\nEx B, Tr. 57)  The money order was lost and Applicant required to wait 90 days before another\nmoney order would be issued. In May 12006, Applicant and his wife filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy\nprotection to prevent foreclosure of the home during the 90-day wait. (Tr. 59-60)\nApplicant married in November 1989, separated in 1998, and divorced in October 2000.\nApplicant was obligated to pay child support and his ex-wife was responsible for the mortgage\npayments on the house. (Tr. 54) He pays $400 per month over and above the required $800 per\nmonth child support. (Tr. 76)  In November 2000, he married his current wife, who earns $23,000\nper year.  His salary at his overseas location is $8,000 per month. (Tr. 81, Gov Ex 2, App Exs E and\nF 12)  He will continue at his oversea location until February 2008.  His home is valued at $140,000\non which he has a $90,000 mortgage.  His monthly first mortgage is $1,100 and his second is $330.\n(Tr. 75, 76) He has approximately $11,000 in his 401(k) retirement plan. \n\n3\nIn 1994, there was a voluntary repossession of a vehicle. (SOR 1.w) Fees related to that\nrepossession were generated.  Applicant included the debt in his Chapter 13.  He is still investigating\nthis obligation. \nAt one time Applicant\u2019s expenses exceeded his income (SOR 1.aa), this is no longer the case.\nApplicant does not have any credit cards.  He is current on his mortgage payments, utility bills, and\nvehicle debt. (Tr. 91)  He is not receiving any calls or letters from creditors. (Tr. 79) In his first\nmarriage, his wife handled the finances.  In his current marriage he now handles the finances.

Additionally, each decision must be a fair and\nimpartial commonsense decision based upon the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the\nwhole person concept, and the factors listed in Section 6.3 of the Directive. The adjudicative\nguidelines are to be applied by administrative judges on a case-by-case basis with an eye toward\nmaking determinations that are clearly consistent with the interests of national security. The\npresence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not determinative\nof a conclusion for or against an applicant.  However, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed\nwhenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance. Considering the evidence as a whole,\nI conclude the relevant guidelines to be applied here is Guideline F, financial considerations.\nBURDEN OF PROOF\nThe sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an applicant. Initially, the\nGovernment must establish, by substantial evidence, that conditions exist in the personal or\nprofessional history of the applicant which disqualify, or may disqualify, an applicant from being\neligible for access to classified information. The burden of proof in a security clearance case is\nsomething less than a preponderance of evidence, although the government is required to present\nsubstantial evidence to meet its burden of proof.  Substantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but\nless than a preponderance of the evidence. All that is required is proof of facts and circumstances\nwhich indicate an applicant is at risk for mishandling classified information, or that an applicant\ndoes not demonstrate the high degree of judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness required of persons\nhandling classified information.  Additionally, the government must prove controverted facts alleged\nin the SOR.  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to present\nevidence to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government's case.  Additionally, an applicant has the\nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.2\nAs noted by the United States Supreme Court in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518,\n528 (1988), \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d A person who has access to classified\ninformation enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence.\nThe government, therefore, has a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the\nrequisite judgment, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests. The\n\u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt\nabout an applicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information in favor of protecting national\nsecurity.  Security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials. \nCONCLUSIONS\nThe Government has satisfied its initial burden of proof under Guideline F, Financial\nConsiderations. A person\u2019s relationship with her creditors is a private matter until evidence is\n\n6\nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed upon terms.\nAbsent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an applicant with a history of\nserious or recurring financial difficulties is in a position of risk that is inconsistent with the holding\nof a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be debt free, but is required to manage his\nfinances so as to meet his financial obligations.\nFinancial considerations become a security concern when a person has significant delinquent\ndebts. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal or\nunethical acts to generate funds to meet financial obligations. Additionally, an individual who is\nfinancially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligations to\nprotect classified information.  Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life provides\nan indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life. \nApplicant owed approximately $300,000 on 25 delinquent debts.  The debt, less vehicles and\nmortgages, was approximately $51,000. Disqualifying Conditions (DC) 19(a) \u201cinability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d and 19(c) \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d apply. \nSome of the debts (SOR 1.i, 1y, 1.z) are not his debts but are his current wife\u2019s debts.  Two\nof them were incurred before they were married and are not his obligation. When Applicant returned\nfrom an overseas deployment, he discovered his mortgage had not been paid for four months.  He\nfiled Chapter 13 bankruptcy to prevent foreclosure.  On his return, Applicant realized he had to take\ncontrol of his finances and could no longer allow his wife to manage their financial affairs. \nApplicant paid the balance due on the home where his ex-wife lives. He is current on his\nmortgage on the home he lives in with his current wife.  They are current on their vehicle payments.\nHe is current on his monthly utilities.  He has no credit cards and is not being contacted by creditors\nabout delinquent debts.  There is a clear indication the problem is being resolved or under control.\nMitigating Conditions (MC) 20 (c) \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the\nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control\u201d\napplies. Since Applicant took control of the family\u2019s finances, the debts have been paid.\nAdditionally, the delinquencies occurred under such circumstances that they are not likely to recur.\nMC  20(a) \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d applies.\nAll of the debts listed in the SOR, but one, have been paid or are current or are not his debt.\nMitigating Condition (MC) 20(d) \u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue\ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts,\u201d applies to theses debts.  In 1994, there was a voluntary\nrepossession of a vehicle (SOR 1.w) resulting in a $1,000 debt. Applicant is investigating this\nobligation. Having paid all of his other debts, I feel confident he will satisfy this debt. \nWhile the record contains information addressed in multiple adjudicative guidelines,\nconsideration should also be given to information  bearing on the whole person.  The adjudicative\nprocess must include examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative\ndetermination that the person is an acceptable security risk.  Therefore, I have also considered: the\nnature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; Applicant\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the\nconduct; the circumstances surrounding the conduct; Applicant\u2019s voluntary and knowledgeable\nparticipation; the motivation for the conduct; the frequency and recency of the conduct; presence\n\n7\nor absence of rehabilitation; potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and the\nprobability that the circumstance or conduct will continue or recur in the future. \nOn balance, the record before me support a conclusion Applicant has mitigated the security\nconcerns. \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings as required by Section 3, Paragraph 7, of Enclosure 1 of the Directive are\nhereby rendered as follows:\nParagraph 1 Financial Considerations: \nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a-aa:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

Blank, Jr., Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a\ntrustworthiness determination.  On August 25, 2006, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR)\n\n2\nadvising Applicant of the basis for that decision\u2013trustworthiness concerns raised under Guideline\nF (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On April\n11, 2007, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Mary E. Henry granted Applicant\u2019s request for a\ntrustworthiness determination.  Department Counsel filed a timely appeal pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6\nE3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nDepartment Counsel raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in her\napplication of the Guideline F mitigating factors; whether the Judge\u2019s whole person analysis is\nunsupported by the record evidence; and whether the Judge\u2019s finding that Applicant did not falsify\nher application is unsupported by record evidence.  Finding error, we reverse.\nWhether the Record Supports the Administrative Judge\u2019s Factual Findings\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: at the time of the hearing, Applicant\nwas a 34 year-old employee of a government contractor.  Over the course of several years, Applicant\namassed a number of debts.  She had two automobiles which were repossessed in 2003, one in the\namount of $7,149 and the other in the amount of $13, 567.  Applicant has been paying $100 a month\non the smaller of the two.  She testified that she was not aware that repossession did not necessarily\nextinguish a debt.\nShe also owes $102 for an internet bill; $987 for a mail order account; $92 for a \u201cdish\nnetwork\u201d bill; $348 for a collection account; $2,893 for a loan; $159 for cable services; and $135\nfor medical services.  None of these bills had been paid at the close of the record.  Applicant also\nowes $386 for a collection account; $1,092 for a credit card; and $1,666 for a store account.\nApplicant either does not recognize these debts or disagrees with the amounts owed.  \nApplicant married in 1999.  During the course of the marriage, Applicant\u2019s husband\u2019s\nworking hours were decreased to 30 hours a week, which had a financial impact on the family.  In\n2001, the couple separated.  In 2006 Applicant hired a credit counseling agency.  This agency\nassisted her in getting some debts removed from her credit report. \nWhether the Record Supports the Administrative Judge\u2019s Ultimate Conclusions\nThe Appeal Board may reverse the Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or revoke a\ntrustworthiness determination if it is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See Directive \u00b6\u00b6\nE3.1.32.3 and E3.1.33.3.  Once the government presents evidence raising trustworthiness concerns,\nthe burden shifts to the applicant to establish any appropriate mitigating conditions.  See Directive\n\u00b6 E3.1.15.  \u201cThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and whole person factors\ndoes not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the particular facts of a case.\nRather, their application requires the exercise of sound discretion in light of the record evidence as\na whole.\u201d  See ADP Case No. 05-12037 at 3 (App. Bd. May 10, 2007).  A trustworthiness\ndetermination must be guided by common sense in light of the record as a whole.  See Directive \u00b6\nE2.2.3.\n\nDirective \u00b6  E2.A6.1.3.4.\n1\nDirective \u00b6  E2.A6.1.3.3.  \u201cThe conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person\u2019s\n2\ncontrol . . .\u201d  \nSee Directive \u00b6 E2.A6.1.3.1.  \u201cThe behavior was not recent.\u201d\n3\nApplicant claimed that she did not realize that she had the large number of delinquent debts alleged in the SOR.\n4\nThe Judge found this claim credible, holding in favor of Applicant on Guideline E allegations of falsification of her\npublic trust questionnaire as to the existence of debts over 90 and 180 days respectively.  Assuming without deciding\nthat the Judge\u2019s finding is sustainable, such lack of awareness impugns Applicant\u2019s judgment and reliability.  See ISCR\nCase No. 01-13815 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan, 8, 2003) (Reasons underlying a failure to pay debt relevant to evaluating an\napplicant\u2019s reliability).\n3\nRegarding Guideline F, the Judge concluded that Applicant has met her burden of persuasion\nconcerning Financial Consideration Mitigating Condition (FCMC) 4,  which contemplates that an\n1\napplicant has engaged the services of some variety of debt management agency in an effort to gain\ncontrol over his or her financial situation.  See, e. g., ISCR Case No. 03-23765 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan.\n31, 2006) (\u201cThe Administrative Judge noted Applicant\u2019s efforts to deal with his overdue debts,\nincluding his receiving debt management credit counseling . . .\u201d)  However, examination of\nApplicant Exhibit (AE) U reveals that, in this case, the agency which Applicant hired merely\nattempts to remove \u201cerrors, misrepresentations, or unverifiable information\u201d from a client\u2019s credit\nreport.  Applicant\u2019s contract with this agency states explicitly, however, that \u201c[t]his is not a debt\nconsolidation or bill payment program.\u201d  AE U at 2.  All this agency appears to do is to have matters\nremoved from a client\u2019s credit report which, by law, may be so removed.  It does not go further and\nattempt resolution of debts that are legitimately the client\u2019s own.  Therefore, the Judge erred to the\nextent that she concluded that Applicant established FCMC 4.  \nThe Judge also gave Applicant some credit for the fact that her financial difficulties were\nexacerbated by her husband\u2019s loss of income  and that she has not amassed \u201csignificant, new\n2\ndelinquent debt\u201d over the three years preceding the decision.   Additionally, the Judge noted that\n3\nmost of her unpaid debts are now beyond the statute of limitations, removing an incentive for\nApplicant to violate her position of trust in exchange for debt forgiveness or repayment.\nHowever, we also note contrary record evidence, principally that Applicant\u2019s relatively\nextensive debts are ongoing and that she has made minimal efforts at repayment.  Indeed, other than\na plan to pay off the remaining debt on one of her repossessed cars, Applicant has made no\nappreciable effort in this regard.  Applicant stated her intent to pay her debts; however, \u201cpromises\nto pay . . . [are] not a substitute for a consistent record of timely remedial action.\u201d  ISCR Case No.\n02-31872 at 4 (App. Bd. May 24, 2005); see also ISCR Case No. 01-08410 at 3 (App. Bd. May 8,\n2002) (A\u201cpromise to pay off unresolved debts in the future does not constitute evidence of reform\nor rehabilitation . . .\u201d)  Applicant\u2019s past failure seriously to approach creditors  and her failure  to\n4\nengage the services of a debt management agency vitiate the mitigating force of her husband\u2019s job\nproblems.  That is, while his loss of income may constitute a situation that was outside Applicant\u2019s\ncontrol, they did not relieve Applicant of the responsibility to take timely and reasonable steps to\naddress her financial problems.  In any event, Applicant\u2019s history of bad debt is extensive and\npredates in part and post dates in part her marital difficulties.  See Tr. at 59.  Additionally, reliance\nupon legal defenses such as the statute of limitations does not necessarily demonstrate prudence,\nhonesty, and reliability; therefore, such reliance is of diminished probative value in resolving\n\n4\ntrustworthiness concerns arising out of financial problems.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at\n4 (App. Bd.

She\nhas mitigated the government\u2019s concerns under Guidelines F and E. Eligibility for trustworthiness\nis granted.\nSTATEMENT OF CASE\nOn October 2, 2003, Applicant submitted an application for a position of public trust, an\nADP I/II/III position, which she resubmitted on August 18, 2004 and resigned on October 24, 2004.\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant the application under\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (the \"Directive\").  On August 25, 2006, DOHA issued\n1\nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision. The SOR, which is in\nessence the administrative complaint, alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct).\nIn a sworn statement dated September 22, 2006, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations\nand requested a hearing. DOHA assigned this case to me on December 21, 2006. DOHA issued a\nnotice of hearing on January 29, 2007, which Applicant received about a week before the hearing.\nAt the hearing on February 15, 2007, Applicant waived her right to 15 days notice of the hearing,\nwhich was conducted as scheduled. The government submitted six exhibits (GE), which were\nmarked and admitted into the record as GE 1-6 without objection. Applicant submitted 12 exhibits\n(App Ex) which were marked and admitted into the record as App Ex A-L without objection. She\ntestified on her own behalf. The record was held open until March 8, 2007, to allow Applicant to\nsubmit further documents, which she timely did. She submitted 12 additional documents, which were\nmarked and admitted as App Ex M-X without objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.)\non March 9, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nIn her SOR response, Applicant admitted to SOR allegations 1.c, 1.d, 1.k, and 1.l under\nGuideline F. She also admitted 1.b and 1.j under Guideline F, but denied the amount owed. She\ndenies all of the remaining allegations under Guideline F and the Guideline E allegations.\nApplicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough and careful review of\nthe pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.2\n\nGE 1 (Questionnaire for Public Trst Positions, dated August 18, 2004); Tr. at 30, 33.\n3\nTr. at 30, 33-34, 41-42, 58-59, 63, 72-75.\n4\nGE 4 (Credit report, dated October 20, 2001); GE 5 (Credit report, dated May 11, 2004); and GE 6 (Credit\n5\nreport, dated June 14, 2006).\nResponse to SOR; Tr. at 38.\n6\nTr. at 38.\n7\nGE 3 (Interrogatory answers, dated July 5, 2006) at 6; Tr. at 40.\n8\n3\nApplicant, a 34-year-old woman seeking a position of public trust, works as a claims\nassociate for a Department of Defense contractor. She has worked for her employer for 10 years. She\nis a high school graduate with technical college training. She married in 1999 and separated from\nher husband around Christmas of 2001.3\nFinancial Considerations\nDuring her marriage, Applicant and her husband purchased cars and established credit\naccounts based on their income. Her husband\u2019s work hours declined from 48 to 60 hours a week to\n30 hours a week. The resulting loss of income impacted their ability to pay their bills. They\nvoluntarily returned one car to the note holder for resale, as they could not meet the monthly\npayment. The note holder repossessed another car, when they failed to meet the monthly payments.\nThey also got behind in other bills. Their financial problems also impacted their marriage.4\nA review of Applicant\u2019s credit reports dated October 20, 2001, May 11, 2004, June 14, 2006,\nand the SOR shows 12 unpaid debts totaling $28,576. The current status of these debts is as follows:5\nSOR \u00b6\nTYPE OF DEBT (date)\nAMOUNT\nCURRENT STATUS\n1.a\nCollection account\n(2000)\n$     386.00\nUnpaid - Applicant does not\nrecognize debt6\n1.b.\nCredit card (2001)\n$  1,092.00\nUnpaid - Disagrees with\namount, owes $2507\n1.c\nInternet bill (2002)\n$     102.00\nUnpaid\n1.d\nMail order account\n(2002)\n$     987.00\nUnpaid\n1.e\nDish Network bill\n(2000)\n$       92.00\nUnpaid\n1.f\nCollection account\n(2000)\n$     348.00\nUnpaid8\n\nApp Ex N (Letter, dated September 22, 2005) at 1.\n9\nApp Ex T (On Line dispute filing with credit agency, undated).\n10\nApp Ex M (Earnings and leave statements, dated March 2, 2007 and February 2, 2007); App Ex W (2006\n11\nfederal and state tax returns); Tr. at 35-40.\nApp Ex O (Undated letter from credit counselor) at 1; App Ex P (Application for credit counseling, dated\n12\nMarch 4, 2006) at 1; App Ex Q (Copy of notice of on line challenge to debt, date June 5, 2006); App Ex T, supra note\n10; Tr at 30, 69-70, 72, 78-79, 88.\n4\n1.g\nLoan (2003)\n$  2,893.00\nUnpaid\n(balance based on 2004\ncredit report, not $4,585.63\nas alleged in SOR)\n1.h\nAutomobile voluntary\nrepossession (2003)\n$  7,149.00\nPaying $100 a month9\n1.i\nAutomobile\nrepossession (2003)\n$13,567.00\nUnpaid\n1.j\nStore account (2003)\n$  1,666.00\nUnpaid - disagrees with\namount owed10\n1.k\nCable bill (2003)\n$     159.00\nUnpaid\n1.l\nMedical bill (2005)\n$     135.00\nUnpaid\nApplicant\u2019s gross monthly pay is $2,425 plus occasional overtime. Her net monthly pay\nvaries, but is approximately $2,137. Her monthly expenses include $610 for rent, $70 for electricity,\n$60 for cable, $60 for telephone, $140 for gasoline, $103 for insurance, $220 for food, $200 for car\npayment, and $100 on debt payment for total monthly expenses of $1,563. She did not include\nmiscellaneous expenses or clothing, which I estimate at $100. She also provides her elderly, ill, and\nretired father $200 a month towards the cost of his prescription drugs. With these additional costs,\nshe has about $300 a month available to pay her debts. She has no credit cards. She anticipates a\nsignificant income tax refund which she plans to use to pay some of her debt.11\nIn early 2006, Applicant retained the services of a credit counseling agency to help resolve\nher credit problems. She paid this agency a fee, but cannot determine with clarity exactly what debts\nhave been resolved, if any. The credit counseling agency advised her that several debts had been\nremoved from her credit report. She also challenged some of the debts listed on her credit reports.12\nPersonal Conduct\nOn October 2, 2003 and August 18, 2004, Applicant completed a Public Trust Position\nApplication (SF 85-P). She answered \u201cyes\u201d to question 22. Your Financial Record b- \u201cAre you now\nover 180 days delinquent on any loan or financial obligation? (Include loans or obligations funded\n\n Gov.

She did not list any of the other\ndebts identified in the SOR.13\nApplicant believed that since both cars had been repossessed and sold, she did not owe any\nadditional money on her debt. Because she had not seen a credit report, she did not remember the\nother delinquent debts at the time she completed her application, although she acknowledged that\nshe had known about these debts in the past. Her management directed staff to complete the\nquestionnaire as best they could and to guesstimate when they did not know an answer.14\nApplicant\u2019s performance review for 2005 rated her at sometimes exceeds expectations and\nfor 2006 rated her at the highest end of meets expectations. One manager describes her as an\nexcellent customer service representative. A co-worker describes her as conscientious and energetic,\nwith a commitment to her work and to others. She is described as a person of integrity, and a person\nwho now understands the need to manage her finances diligently.15\nPOLICIES\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national\nsecurity and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position \u2026\nthat will give that person access to such information.\u201d  In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\n16\nClassified Information Within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), the President set out guidelines and\nprocedures for safeguarding classified information and determining trustworthiness within the\nexecutive branch. \nTo be eligible for a security clearance or access to sensitive information, an applicant must\nmeet the security guidelines contained in the Directive. Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth\npersonnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions under\neach guideline. The adjudicative guidelines at issue in this case are: \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations - An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal or unethical acts to generate\nfunds to meet financial obligations. Similarly, an individual who is financially\nirresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligation\nto protect classified or sensitive information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly\nin one aspect of life provides an indication of how a person may behave in other\naspects of life.\n\n Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.1.\n17\n Id.\n18\n Id.\n19\n Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n20\n Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n21\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. December 19, 2002).\n22\n Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.2.\n23\n6\nGuideline E - Personal Conduct - Conduct involving questionable judgment,\nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to\ncomply with rules and regulations could indicate that the person may not properly\nsafeguard classified information. \nConditions that could raise a trustworthiness concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those\nwhich could mitigate security concerns pertaining to these adjudicative guidelines, are set forth\nand discussed in the conclusions below.\n\"The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.  An administrative\n17\njudge must apply the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d and consider and carefully weigh the available,\nreliable information about the person.  An administrative judge should consider the following\n18\nfactors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the\nconduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4)\nthe individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation;\n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the\nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9)\nthe likelihood of continuation or recurrence.   \n19\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR\nthat disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to classified\ninformation.  Thereafter, the applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain,\n20\nextenuate, or mitigate the facts.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is\n21\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d  Any doubt\n22\nas to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be\nresolved in favor of the national security.  The same rules apply to trustworthiness determinations\n23\nfor access to sensitive positions.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. The government\nhas established a prima facie case for disqualification under Guideline F - Financial Considerations,\nand Guideline E - Personal Conduct. \n\nThe Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay overdue creditors or\n24\notherwise resolve debts:\nIn order to qualify for application of Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition 6, an applicant\nmust present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other\ngood-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not define the term\n\u2018good-faith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith \u2018requires a showing that\na person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or\nobligation.\u2019 Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a\nlegally available option (such as bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of Financial Considerations\n7\nFinancial Considerations\nBased on all the evidence, Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions (FC DC)\nE2.A6.1.2.1 (A history of not meeting financial obligations), and FC DC E2.A6.1.2.3 (Inability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts) apply to Applicant's case. Applicant has many unpaid, delinquent\ndebts. For most of these debts, she did not make an effort to resolve them.\nI considered the Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC). I cannot apply FC\nMC E2.A6.1.3.1 (The behavior was not recent), and FC MC E2.A6.1.3.2 (The behavior was isolated)\nbecause she still carries a significant amount of outstanding delinquent debts for a variety of bills. She\nincurred these debts over several years. Applicant has not paid any of the small debts she\nacknowledges are hers.\nFC MC E2.A6.1.3.3 (The conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the\nperson's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or\na death, divorce, or separation)) applies in part. Applicant and her husband obtained credit to finance\npurchases, primarily new car purchases. When his income declined by almost 50%, they encountered\ndifficulty with paying their bills. This financial strain lead to their separation, and a reduced\nhousehold income for Applicant, who became her own sole support. With only her income, she\ncannot pay all her debts at one time.\nFC MC E2.A6.1.3.4 (The person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and\nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or under control) applies. About one\nyear ago, Applicant contacted a credit counseling agency to help resolve her credit problems. Through\nthis agency, she challenged some of the debts listed on her credit report. Her challenges resulted in\na deletion of some debts from her credit reports. She pays her current bills timely, and has not\nincurred any significant delinquent debt since 2003.\nFC MC E2.1.3.6 (The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts) is applicable in part. A promise to pay in the future is not sufficient to\nmitigate the financial considerations concern or evidence of a good faith effort to repay debt.\nAlthough Applicant has indicted that she will use her substantial tax return to pay some of her smaller\ndebts, she has not shown that she has done so. She entered into a payment plan with one creditor in\nSeptember 2005and made at least one payment. She, however, has not established she continually and\ntimely makes the agreed upon payments.24\n\nMitigating Condition 6. \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting ISCR Case No.\n99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). In ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 6 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999), the Appeal Board\nspecifically addressed application of the statute of limitations, stating a \u201cperson who decides not to honor his or her debts\nmay be able to avoid paying those debts until they are legally uncollectible because the statute of limitations has run.\nReliance on the running of a statute of limitations would be a legally permissible course of action. However, it would\nnot demonstrate a good-faith effort to resolve one\u2019s debts that would fall under the meaning of Financial Considerations\nMitigating Condition 6.\u201d See ISCR Case No. 03-10880 (App. Bd. June 24, 2005); ISCR Case No. 01-09691 (App. Bd.\nMar. 27, 2003) (stating an applicant must do more than merely cite the statute of limitations to obtain the full benefit of\nFC MC 6). See also ISCR Case No. 01-09691 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 27, 2003) (\u201c[E]ven if a delinquent debt is legally\nunenforceable under state law, the federal government is entitled to consider the facts and circumstances surrounding\nan applicant\u2019s conduct in incurring and failing to satisfy the debt in a timely manner.\u201d); ISCR Case No. 98-0349 at 2-3\n(App. Bd. Feb. 3, 1999) (even though an applicant\u2019s delinquent debts were not legally collectible because of the statute\nof limitations, that fact did not preclude the Administrative Judge from considering the applicant\u2019s failure to resolve the\ndelinquent debts before the statute of limitations ran). Cf. ISCR Case No. 01-04425 at 3-4 (App. Bd. May 17, 2002)\n(adverse Guideline F conclusions possible where applicant chose not to pay her delinquent debts, waited until her\ncreditors ceased trying to collect those delinquent debts, and they were eventually dropped from her credit report.).\nSee ISCR Case No. 04-07360 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 26, 2006) (stating partial credit was available under FCMC\n25\n6 for debts being resolved through garnishment). \n8\nShe does, however, receive some credit in the whole person analysis, infra, for the application\nof the 3-year South Carolina statute of limitations, which applies to 11 of her 12 unpaid SOR debts.\nSee S.C. Code. Ann. \u00a7 15-3-530.  The South Carolina Court of Appeals succinctly explained the\n25\nsocietal and judicial value of application of the statute of limitations:\nStatutes of limitations embody important public policy considerations in that they\nstimulate activity, punish negligence and promote repose by giving security and\nstability to human affairs. The cornerstone policy consideration underlying statutes of\nlimitations is the laudable goal of law to promote and achieve finality in litigation.\nSignificantly, statutes of limitations provide potential defendants with certainty that\nafter a set period of time, they will not be ha[led] into court to defend time-barred\nclaims. Moreover, limitations periods discourage plaintiffs from sitting on their rights.\nStatutes of limitations are, indeed, fundamental to our judicial system.\nCarolina Marine Handling, Inc. v. Lasch, 363 S.C. 169, 175-76, 609 S.E.2d 548, 552 (S.C. Ct. App.\n2005) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).\nElimination of her delinquent debt load through the statute of limitations has ended her\npotential vulnerability to improper financial inducements because she is no longer \u201cfinancially\noverextended,\u201d but it does not negate her past conduct in not paying her outstanding debts.\nPersonal Conduct\nPersonal conduct under Guideline E is always a trustworthiness concern because it asks the\ncentral question does a person's past conduct justifies confidence the person can be trusted to properly\nsafeguard classified and/or sensitive information.  Deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification\nof a material fact in any written document or oral statement to the government when applying for a\n\nSee ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov.17, 2004)(explaining holding in ISCR Case No. 02-23133\n26\nat 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004)).\n9\nsecurity clearance or in other official matters is a trustworthiness concern.  It is deliberate if it is done\nknowingly and willfully.\nUnder Guideline E, the government established that Applicant omitted material facts from her\nSF-85P when she answered question 20 b. She denies, however, that she deliberately falsified her\nanswer to this question, arguing that she did not know she still owed money on her repossessed cars\nand that she did not remember the other debts. When a falsification allegation is controverted, the\ngovernment has the burden of proving it. Proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or\nprove an applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the omission occurred. An administrative judge\nmust consider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial\nevidence concerning an applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the omission occurred.  For\n26\nPersonal Conduct Disqualifying Conditions (PC DC) E2.A5.1.2.2 (The deliberate omission,\nconcealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire\n. . . .) and PC DC E2.A5.1.2.3 (Deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning\nrelevant and material matters to an investigator . . . .) to apply, the government must establish that\nApplicant\u2019s omission, concealment or falsification in her answers was deliberate. Applicant credibly\ntestified that she believed that once she voluntarily returned her car to the note holder and the car was\nsold, she no longer owed any money on the car note. She also held this same belief regarding the car\nthat was involuntarily repossessed. In addition, her testimony that she did not review her credit report\nprior to completing her SF-85P is reasonable, as the average individual is not likely to obtain a credit\nreport to complete an application. Thus, Applicant did not deliberately falsify her trustworthiness\napplication. The government has not established its case under Guideline E.\nWhole Person Analysis\nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The\nobjective of the trustworthy determination process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of\na person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for assignment to\nsensitive duties. Indeed, the adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in\nconsidering the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality\nof their acts, omissions, motivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own\nmerits, taking into consideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature\nthinking, and careful analysis.\nI have considered all the evidence and the \u201cwhole person\u201d in evaluating Applicant's\ntrustworthiness. As noted above, Applicant's lengthy history of failing to meet her financial\nobligations, and inability or unwillingness to satisfy her debts raises serious trustworthiness concerns.\nShe is 34 years old, and sufficiently mature to be fully responsible for her conduct. During her\nmarriage, she and her husband used credit to purchase cars and others items. Their inability to\ncontinue with their monthly debt payments started when her husband\u2019s work hours decreased by\nalmost 50%. When she and her husband separated, she had to assume full responsibility for her\nnormal living expenses and her debts, plus some responsibility for joint marital debts. Given her\nlimited income, she had to make choices about how to use her limited resources. She chose to pay her\nliving expenses, which she timely does. To her credit, she provides a significant amount of money\n\nSee ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd. June 28, 2006).\n27\n10\neach month to help pay for her father\u2019s expensive prescription drugs, money which would otherwise\nbe available to pay her old debts. She stopped using credit cards to purchase items. She timely pays\nher monthly bills, including her rent. She incurred only one unpaid debt after 2003. \nShe sought help to resolve her debt through credit counseling. This avenue has not provided\nthe assistance she had hoped. The absence of significant, new delinquent debt over the last three years\nand compliance with a budget are additional factors which evidence rehabilitation, positive behavior\nchanges, and self-discipline in regards to her finances. The potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress is low because she is current on her recent debts, and has been steadily\nemployed for the last 10 years. She is very conscious of her income limitations and has shown an\nability to live within her monthly income. Her attitude about her finances and her adherence to her\nbudget support a determination of trustworthiness.\nIn sum, in the absence of unanticipated and unusual expenses, the likelihood of new debt\nproblems is low. Applicant has not only stated an intent to resolve her delinquent debts, she has\ndeveloped a payment plan for one large debt, even though she is not legally required to pay this debt\nor her other delinquent debts because of the South Carolina 3-year statute of limitations. Although\nall of the 12 SOR debts remain unpaid, there is little likelihood that this unpaid debt would present\na security clearance problem as she is not legally liable for 11 of these debts. She is a long-term\nemployee with a good performance record. She has not been disciplined for violation of patient\nprivacy issues and there is little likelihood she would violate these privacy rights because of her\nexisting debt problems. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts\nand circumstances, in the context of the whole person,  I conclude she has mitigated the\n27\ntrustworthiness concerns pertaining to financial considerations, and the personal conduct concerns\nare not substantiated.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nSOR \u00b6 1-Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs a-l:\nFor Applicant\nSOR \u00b6 2-Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph a-b:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\n\n11\nIn light of all of the evidence presented in this case, it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for assignment to sensitive duties.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a\ntrustworthiness designation for an ADP I/II/III position. On August 17, 2006, DOHA issued a\nstatement of reasons advising Applicant of the basis for that decision\u2014trustworthiness concerns\n\n2\nraised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement), Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption), Guideline E\n(Personal Conduct), and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6\n(Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On November 19, 2007, after\nthe hearing, Administrative Judge Philip S. Howe denied Applicant\u2019s request for a trustworthiness\ndesignation.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raises the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law because the Judge failed to consider all of Applicant\u2019s mitigating\nevidence or failed to give proper weight to that evidence.    \nThe following are relevant findings of the Judge in this matter.\nApplicant is 24 years old and attends college part-time while working for a defense\ncontractor.  He started smoking marijuana while in high school, using it once or twice a month from\n1998 to August 2001, and several times a week from August 2001 to August 2004.  He continued\nto use marijuana until March 2005.  In February 2005, Applicant plead guilty to misdemeanor\npossession of THC, the active ingredient in marijuana, and authorities declined prosecution of the\nfelony aspects of the marijuana-related arrest of September 2004 that preceded it.  In March 2005,\nApplicant tested positive in a monthly urinalysis test, while still on probation following the THC\npossession conviction, and after having completed his Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions\n(Standard Form 85).  Applicant contributed money into a pool of funds that a friend used to buy the\nmarijuana used by Applicant and his friends.  \nApplicant also consumed alcohol, primarily beer, from age 16.  He drank in college and\ncontinued to do so regularly until about September 2005, sometimes to the point of intoxication. \nIn July 2002, Applicant was charged with disorderly conduct, and he admitted that he was\nintoxicated at that time.  Applicant was charged and convicted of underage drinking.  He was\narrested and convicted of operating a vehicle with a prohibited alcohol content.  In September 2004,\nApplicant was arrested and later pled guilty to a second offense of operating a motor vehicle while\nintoxicated.  By the time of the hearing, Applicant claimed to be drinking only a few beers each\nmonth with friends in bars while watching athletic games.      \nFinally, Applicant falsified his Standard Form 85, executed by him on November 15, 2004,\nby replying \u201cno\u201d when asked whether in the past year he had illegally used any controlled substance\nincluding marijuana. \nIn his appeal brief, Applicant asks for leniency.  In support of this request, Applicant\nessentially argues that his misconduct was not recent and that he has reformed his lifestyle. We\nconstrue his position to be that he has mitigated any trustworthiness concerns that might exist under\nthe four guidelines and that the Judge either did not consider or give adequate weight to his evidence\nof mitigation.  Among other things, Applicant points out that he paid all fines, completed all terms\nof his probation, and attended all alcohol assessment classes.  He now associates with different\nfriends who are \u201cgoal-oriented, driven . . . model citizens.\u201d  He claims that he ceased using marijuana\nin March 2005, and cut his alcohol consumption to a manageable level.  He says that he is now able\nto pursue a bachelor degree in two disciplines, which he says he would not be able to do if he had\n\n3\ncontinued living the life style he lived four years ago.  His grades have improved.  He argues that he\nwill not be able to continue to make improvements as quickly if he is not allowed to continue in his\nposition.  A  job loss, he argues, will prevent him from pursuing a college education, and he would\nbe set back for things that happened three or four years in the past. \nThere is a rebuttable presumption that the Judge considered all the record evidence, unless\nthe Judge specifically states otherwise; and there is no requirement that the Judge mention or discuss\nevery piece of record evidence when reaching a decision.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-09915 at 3\n(App. Bd. Dec. 16, 2004).  Applicant admitted the SOR allegations  against him.  The burden then\nshifted to Applicant to extenuate or mitigate the trustworthiness concerns raised by those allegations.\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15.  The Judge reviewed the possible mitigating conditions for each guideline and\nspecifically explained why none of the possible mitigating conditions applied to Applicant\u2019s\ncircumstances, and how Applicant had not presented evidence sufficient to overcome the\ntrustworthiness concerns raised by his conduct.  The Judge also performed a whole-person analysis\nusing the criteria in Directive \u00b6 E2.2, and specifically explained why Applicant\u2019s circumstances did\nnot support a whole-person analysis in favor of Applicant. \nThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and whole-person factors does not\nturn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the particular facts of a case.  Thus, the\npresence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable\ntrustworthiness determination.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole\nand decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  An\napplicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a\ndifferent interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate that the Judge weighed the\nevidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See,\ne.g., ADP Case No. 06-11792 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 15, 2007).  In this case, Applicant presented\nsome evidence of reform, but the Judge\u2019s findings and conclusions against Applicant were\nsustainable, including those related to the recency and non-isolated nature of Applicant\u2019s conduct,\nthe insufficiency of Applicant\u2019s evidence of reform including discontinued use of marijuana and\npositive changes in support of sobriety, and the failure of Applicant to admit the falsification of the\nStandard Form 85 until after he was confronted by an investigator.   \nFinally, an applicant for a trustworthiness designation is not made more or less suitable for\na favorable determination based on how the determination might affect the applicant\u2019s job status or\nfinancial situation.  See, e.g., ADP Case No. 07-01610 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 7, 2008).\n\n4\n \nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s unfavorable trustworthiness determination is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Michael D.

He has several alcohol and marijuana-related arrests and\nincidents between 2002 and 2005.

Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended\n2\nand modified, and the Directive.\n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a\nposition of trust for Applicant .  On August 17, 2006, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons  (SOR)\n1\n2\ndetailing the basis for its decision\u2013trustworthiness concerns raised under Guideline H (Drug\nInvolvement) and Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption) of the Adjudicative Guidelines of the\nDirective issued on January 2, 1992, and as amended through Change 4, dated April 20, 1999.\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on September 11, 2006, and elected to have a hearing before\nan administrative judge.  The case was assigned to me on May 2, 2007.  On August 8, 2007, I\nconvened a hearing to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or\ncontinue a trustworthiness determination for Applicant.  The Government and the Applicant\nsubmitted exhibits that were admitted into evidence.  DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on\nAugust 23, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant's admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated as findings of fact.  After a\ncomplete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and full consideration of that evidence,\nI make the following additional findings of fact:\nApplicant is 24 years old, unmarried, attending college part-time to obtain a business degree,\nand works for a defense contractor in the health insurance business.  Applicant is a claims processor\nfor his employer.  He started working there in November 2004.  His employee performance\nevaluations show he achieves or exceeds his supervisors\u2019 expectations on quality of work and\nproductivity.  A former supervisor of Applicant considers him hard-working, volunteering to do\nspecial projects and working overtime when necessary.  The supervisor also considered Applicant\nto be honest and trustworthy. (Tr. 92, 103-111, 119, 174; Exhibits 1, 2, A-F)\nApplicant started smoking marijuana when he was in high school, using it once or twice a\nmonth from 1998 to August 2001.  He smoked it four or five times a week in college, from August\n2001 to August 2004.  His academic performance suffered because of his marijuana use and skipping\nclasses.  He continued to use marijuana with varying frequencies until March 2005.  During this time\nperiod, Applicant would contribute money into a pool of funds that a friend used to buy the\nmarijuana used by Applicant and his friends. (Tr. 119-131, 145, 169; Exhibit 3)\nFrom the age of 16 in high school, Applicant has consumed alcohol, primarily beer.  He\ndrank in college, and continued to do so regularly until about September 2005.  Now, he to drink a\nfew beers each month with friends in bars while they watch televised athletic games.  He drank three\n\n3\nbeers on the weekend before his trustworthiness hearing.  He drank to intoxication with his friends\nonce a month. (Tr. 122, 123, 154, 155, 171; Exhibit 3)\nApplicant was charged on July 27, 2002, with disorderly conduct.  Applicant admitted this\nincident occurred because he had been drinking previously at a wedding reception and was\nintoxicated.  He got into an argument with other patrons in a restaurant.  Applicant paid a $337 fine\nfor that incident.  On June 5, 2003, Applicant was charged with underage drinking.  He was 19 years\nold at the time.  The state minimum drinking age is 21 years of age.  His blood alcohol content\n(BAC) when tested was .01 %.  Applicant was fined $225 for this offense.  Then, on June 25, 2003,\nApplicant was arrested for operating a motor vehicle with a prohibited alcohol content, operating a\nmotor vehicle while his driving privileges were suspended on the basis of points for prior moving\nviolations, and operating a motor vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant.  His BAC was .13%.\nApplicant was found guilty of the first charge, and the other two charges were dismissed.  Applicant\npaid a fine of $250. (Tr. 156-162; Exhibit 3)\nApplicant was with a friend on September 6, 2004, when the friend stopped his car and went\ninto a house to make a sale of marijuana to a female.  Applicant parked his car, and went into the\nhouse also, but did not participate in the sale, nor did he know it was going to happen before he got\nto the house.  After leaving the house, Applicant and his friend drove their separate automobiles\naway, and were stopped by the local police not far away from the house.  Applicant\u2019s car was\nsearched by the police.  He was arrested for manufacture and delivery of marijuana, and operating\na motor vehicle while revoked.  The manufacturing charge is a felony under state law.  In February\n2005, Applicant was offered a charge reduction by the prosecuting attorney to possession of THC,\nthe active ingredient in marijuana.  This charge is a misdemeanor offense.  Applicant accepted the\nreduction, was placed on 14 months probation and fined $273.  The operating while revoked charge\nwas dismissed. (Tr. 132-144, 169, 170; Exhibit 3)\nApplicant\u2019s next arrest occurred on September 30, 2004, for felony bail jumping (he was on\nbail for the felony charge resulting from the September 6, 2004, arrest), reckless driving, refusal to\ntake the breath test, and operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated (second offense).  The first three\ncharges were dismissed, and Applicant pled guilty to the fourth offense.  He paid a fine of $1,280,\nordered to undergo an alcohol assessment, and sentenced to 60 days in jail.  He served five days in\njail, and the remainder of the time was served on house arrest with an electronic ankle bracelet worn\nby him.  His driving privileges were revoked for 18 months, and an ignition interlock system\nattached to his car to prevent him from driving after using alcohol.  Applicant does not recall the\nresults of the alcohol assessment beyond finding he was not an alcoholic, except to claim he\n\u201csuccessfully completed\u201d his required alcohol assessment.  He has not had any treatment or\ncounseling regarding his alcohol use.  His driving privileges were reinstated.  Applicant does not\ndrink and drive since that incident, to avoid further legal problems. (Tr. 164-167, 170, 179, 181;\nExhibit 3)\nOn November 15, 2004, Applicant submitted his Questionnaire for Public Trust Position\n(QPTP) for his current employment position.  He answered Question 21.a, which asked if he had\nused illegally any controlled substance in the past year, including marijuana.  Applicant  marked the\n\u201cno\u201d box, thereby denying he had used controlled substances between November 2003, and\nNovember 2004, when he had used marijuana during that time period.  The QPTP contains a\ncertification signature block which Applicant signed stating his answers to all questions were \u201ctrue,\n\n4\ncomplete, and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief and are made in good faith.\u201d (Tr. 128,\n132, 172; Exhibits 1, 2)\nIn March 2005, while on probation for his September 6, 2004, marijuana arrest and\nconviction, Applicant used marijuana with some friends.  His monthly urinalysis showed the\npresence of marijuana in his body.  Applicant was working for his current government contractor\nemployer at this time.  He claims he does not use marijuana anymore because it is illegal. (Tr. 101,\n145-150; Exhibit 3)\nApplicant asserts he learned several valuable lessons over the past three years, including\nchoosing his friends wisely, making his own decisions, and deciding wisely to become a successful\nperson.  He denies ever having gone to work under the influence of alcohol or controlled substances.\nWhen he told his mother about his drunk driving and drug arrests, he admitted he felt \u201clike the\nsmallest person in the world.\u201d  Applicant also claimed to have suffered depression while in college,\nincluding stress from his part-time job at a pizza restaurant.  He rationalized the marijuana use as\nhelpful in his academic studies, but found it only made him lethargic.  Presently, he claims he has\nthe motivation to improve his work performance  resulting from his purported cessation of marijuana\nuse. (Tr. 99, 118, 125, 169; Exhibit 3)\nApplicant\u2019s mother and step-father testified on his behalf.  His mother thinks Applicant is\nhonest and sincere.  She confronted him about his actions, and advised him that further actions could\njeopardize the lease to purchase agreement they have with him to buy the home in which he currently\nlives with a friend and his girlfriend.  She told her son his actions would reflect on her.  Applicant\u2019s\nstepfather considers Applicant to have a good character.  He drinks socially with Applicant on\nweekends, having a few beers while watching televised athletic events.  He also told Applicant he\nmust remain drug-free to be able to complete the home purchase agreement.  He was not aware of\nApplicant\u2019s controlled drug use until the 2004 arrest.  He did see Applicant drink in 2001 at his high\nschool graduation.  His girlfriend also testified that she has not known him in the past two years to\nuse drugs or drink to excess. (Tr. 18-89)\nPOLICIES\nAs Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information\nbearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to\noccupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d Department of the Navy\nv.

By direction of the Under Secretary of Defense for\nCounterintelligence and Security, adjudications of cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense\nSecurity Service or the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) for a trustworthiness determination\nshall be conducted under the provisions of the Directive.  Eligibility for a position of trust is\npredicated upon the applicant meeting the guidelines contained in the Directive and a finding it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so. See Directive \u00b6 2.3.  An applicant \u201chas the\nultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or\ncontinue his trustworthiness determination.\u201d See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15\n\n5\nThe adjudication process is based on the whole person concept.  Enclosure 2 of the Directive\nsets forth personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating\nconditions (MC) under each guideline that must be carefully considered in making the overall\ncommon sense determination required.  The decision to deny an individual eligibility to occupy a\nposition of trust is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  See Exec. Or.\n10865 \u00a7 7.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President\nand the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a such a determination.\nIn evaluating the trustworthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess\nthe adjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6E2.2 of the Directive and the Guidelines.  Those\nassessments include:  (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct, and the extent of knowledgeable participation; (3) how recent and frequent\nthe behavior was; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the\nvoluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  Because each case\npresents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that the factors exhaust\nthe realm of human experience or that the factors apply equally in every case.  Moreover, although\nadverse information concerning a single condition may not be sufficient for an unfavorable\ndetermination, the individual may be disqualified if available information reflects a recent or\nrecurring pattern of questionable judgment, irresponsibility, or other behavior specified in the\nGuidelines.\nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal\nor professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being\neligible to occupy a position of trust.  The Directive presumes a nexus or rational connection\nbetween proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an\napplicant\u2019s trustworthiness suitability.  See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).\nAll that is required is proof of facts and circumstances that indicate an applicant is at risk for\nmishandling classified information, or that an applicant does not demonstrate the high degree of\njudgment, reliability, or trustworthiness required of persons handling classified information.  ISCR\nCase No. 00-0277, 2001 DOHA LEXIS 335 at **6-8 (App. Bd. 2001).  Once the Government has\nestablished a prima facie case by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut,\nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate\nburden of demonstrating that is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his\ntrustworthiness determination. ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. 2002).  \u201cAny doubt as to\nwhether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved\nin favor of the national security.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E2.2.2\nBased upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following four adjudicative\nGuidelines most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:\nGuideline H: Drug Involvement: The Concern. Improper or illegal involvement with drugs,\nraises questions regarding an individual's willingness or ability to protect classified information.\nDrug abuse or dependence may impair social or occupational functioning, increasing the risk of an\nunauthorized disclosure of classified information. E2.A8.1.1\n\n6\nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption: The Concern: Excessive alcohol consumption often\nleads to the exercise of questionable judgment, unreliability, failure to control impulses, and\nincreases the risk of unauthorized disclosure of classified information due to carelessness. E2.A7.1.1\nGuideline E: Personal Conduct: The Concern: Conduct involving questionable judgment,\nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules\nand regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.\nE2.A5.1.1\nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct: The Concern: A history or pattern of criminal activity\ncreates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability and trustworthiness. E2.A10.1.1\n\u201cThe standard that must be met for . . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all\navailable information, the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that  . . .\nassigning the person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d\n(Regulation \u00b6C6.1.1.1)  Appendix 8 of the Regulation sets forth the adjudicative policy, as well as\nthe disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) associated with each guideline.\nDoD contractor personnel are afforded the adjudication procedures contained in the Directive.\n(Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1)\nCONCLUSIONS\nDrug Involvement: Applicant used marijuana from 1998 to March 2005.  He used it once\nafter starting his work at the defense contractor office in November 2004, and after he completed his\nQTPT in November 2004.  That form asked him about his prior controlled substance use, so he was\non notice that the use of controlled substances was a concern of the Government.  Applicant\u2019s\nmarijuana use increased while he was in college to several times per week, and then tapered off to\nless frequent use.  He purchased marijuana with friends by contributing to a common purchase fund.\nApplicant admitted his college academic performance was adversely affected by his marijuana use.\nThe local police arrested and charged him with manufacturing and delivering marijuana, but the\nfelony charge was later reduced to possession of THC, the active ingredient of marijuana.  In\nFebruary 2005, he was found guilty of this offense.  Then, while on probation for that offense, he\nsmoked marijuana with a friend in March 2005, and tested positive for marijuana in his regular\nurinalysis.\nThe Disqualifying Conditions (DC) applicable here are DC 1 (any drug abuse, defined as the\nillegal use of a drug.  Drugs are further defined as mood and behavior-altering substances, listed in\nthe Controlled Substances Act of 1970, including marijuana. E2.A8.1.2.1), and DC 2 (illegal drug\npossession, including purchase). E2.A8.1.2.2).\nThe Mitigating Conditions (MC) that might apply are MC 1 (the drug involvement was not\nrecent. E2.A8.1.3.1), and MC 3 (a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future.\nE2.A8.1.3.3).  MC 1 does not apply because Applicant\u2019s drug usage occurred within the past two\nyears, making it recent.  He used marijuana for seven years starting in high school.  He used it even\nafter he was hired by his government-contractor employer.  MC 3 requires, for applicability, a\n\u201cdemonstrated intent.\u201d  Applicant has to show by his actions and objective testing that he is no\n\n7\nlonger using marijuana.  He has no such evidence, and the burden of proof is on him.  He has not\nproduced test results beyond the March 2005, positive test, documenting the absence of drug use.\nHis mere declaration when contrasted to his history of use is not persuasive.  His current work\nproduct is favorable according to his supervisor\u2019s statement, but those standing alone are not\npersuasive in view of Applicant\u2019s history.  Neither of the other two MC could apply based on the\nevidence, as Applicant has not attended voluntarily a drug treatment program. \nAlcohol Consumption: Applicant has three alcohol-related arrests between June 5, 2003,\nand September 30, 2004.  He drank alcohol from 1998 to at least September 2005, in quantities\nsufficient for him to become intoxicated.  His 2002 disorderly conduct charge was also caused by\nalcohol consumption, so he really has four alcohol-caused incidents between 2002 and 2004.  He\ncontinues to drink alcohol, claiming only to be drinking beers on social and sporting occasions, and\non weekends.  His driving privileges were revoked, but have now been restored.  He does not recall\nthe diagnosis of the court-ordered alcohol assessment resulting from the September 2004, arrest. \nThe DC applicable are DC 1 (alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving\nwhile under the influence, or other criminal incidents relating to alcohol use. E2.A7.1.2.1), and DC\n5 (habitual consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment. E2.A7.1.2.5).  \nThe MC which might apply are MC 2 (the problem occurred a number of years ago and there\nis no indication of a recent problem. E2.A8.1.3.2), and MC 3 (positive changes in behavior\nsupportive of sobriety. E2.A8.1.3.3).  However, with Applicant\u2019s current consumption of alcohol in\nview of his history of alcohol-related incidents, I am not persuaded this MC applies.  There are\ninsufficient positive changes in his behavior supportive of sobriety.  He has not changed his pattern\nof consumption that led to his two arrests for operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated.  The\nburden of proof is on Applicant to show the MC should apply.  He failed to accomplish that task.\nPersonal Conduct: Applicant completed his QTPT on November 15, 2004, and failed to\ndisclose in answer to Question 21.a. that he used marijuana in the previous year.  His recent\nmarijuana use had to be fresh in his recollection because of its recency in time to the completion of\nthe form.\nThe four DC which might apply are: DC 2 (the deliberate omission, concealment, or\nfalsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history\nstatement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications,\naward benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award\nfiduciary responsibilities); DC 4 (personal conduct that increases an individual\u2019s vulnerability to\ncoercion, exploitation or duress, such as engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the\nperson\u2019s personal, professional, or community standing or render the person susceptible to\nblackmail. E2.A5.1.2.4);  DC 5 (a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations, including violation of any\nwritten or recorded agreement made between the individual and the agency. E2.A5.1.2.5); and, DC\n6 (association with persons involved in criminal activity. E2.A5.1.2.6).  Applicant deliberately did\nnot list his marijuana use on the QTPT.  That failure increases his vulnerability to coercion,\nexploitation or duress because he kept a law violation secret from the Government.  His action was\npart of his pattern of rule or law violations involving the use of alcohol and drugs.  Applicant was\narrested in September 2004, because of his association with his friend who was delivering THC, the\nactive ingredient of marijuana, a felony offense under state law.  He also was part of a group of\n\n8\nfriends who pooled their money in college and afterward to purchase marijuana.  In March 2005, he\nassociated with another friend of his who had marijuana and Applicant used it again.\nThe burden of proof in on Applicant to show any of the Personal Conduct MC apply and\npredominate over the DC.  He failed to accomplish that task.  Nothing he presented on this issue was\ncredible or persuasive that he did not deliberately falsify his QTPT.  Applicant did not disclose his\nmarijuana use history until March 2005, when he was confronted by the Government investigator.\nIt was a recent incident of falsification.  While he may not associate with the persons involved with\ncriminal activity anymore, the key action, of which Applicant is responsible, is the falsification of\nthe answer on his QTPT.\nCriminal Conduct: Applicant committed a disorderly conduct offense in July 2002, caused\nby his alcohol consumption.  He has the September 2004, drug-related offense on his record.  He also\nhas the June 2003, and September 2004, alcohol and driving arrests on his record.  He also\ndeliberately falsified his answer to Question 21.a. on his QTPT.  That deliberate failure to disclose\nwas knowing and willful under the terms and requirements of 18 U.S.C. \u00a71001, which constitutes\na felony offense.\nApplicant made his record of violations in three short years.  Based on that record, the DC\nwhich apply are: DC 1 (allegations or admissions of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the\nperson was formally charged. E2.A10.1.2.1); and, DC 2 (a single serious crime or multiple lesser\noffenses. E2.A10.1.2.2).\nApplicant has the burden of proof to show the MC under this trustworthiness guideline apply.\nHis criminal activity is recent, not isolated, but part of a pattern caused by alcohol and marijuana\nusage.  He was not pressured by others into committing these acts, but committed them voluntarily.\nHe was not acquitted of the alcohol and drug offenses.  There is no clear evidence of rehabilitation,\nwhich is Applicant\u2019s burden to show.  Therefore, I conclude none of the MC listed under the\nGuideline apply to Applicant.\nWhole Person Analysis:  \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period\nof a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is.\" eligible for a\ntrustworthiness decision. (Guidelines \u00b6E2.2.1a)  \"Eligibility for access to classified information is\npredicated upon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudication\nprocess is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept.\nAvailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should\nbe considered in reaching a determination.\u201d  In evaluating Applicant\u2019s case, I have considered the\nadjudicative factors listed in the Guidelines, contained in \u00b6E2.2.\nI considered all nine criteria.  The nature and extent of Applicant\u2019s drug and alcohol use, and\nthe results on the roads, are serious offenses.  He participated in those actions, and the falsification\nof his answer on the QTPT knowingly and voluntarily.  His drinking and use of marijuana were\nfrequent, recent in time, and all occurring in the past nine years.  Applicant\u2019s age from the\ncommencement of these actions started at 16 to his present 24 years of age.  He has not shown any\nrehabilitation by objective and professional agencies, other than his personal statement and the\npassage of time with an absence of further arrests.  In view of the nature and extent of his actions,\nthat position is not persuasive.  His own pleasure was the motivation for the consumption of alcohol\n\n9\nand marijuana.  His actions could lead to pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress by someone\noutside his employer\u2019s operations seeking information or access, especially in view of his history.\nFinally, the likelihood of continuation or recurrence is high, both for alcohol, because he continues\nto drink, and marijuana because of his history over seven years of using it.\nTherefore, based on the total evidence presented by the Government and the Applicant, I\nconclude each of the trustworthiness concerns, and the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d in the following\nmanner.  The drug involvement concern I conclude against Applicant.  I conclude the alcohol\nconsumption concern against Applicant.  I conclude the personal conduct concern against Applicant.\nI conclude the criminal conduct concern against Applicant.  Ultimately, I conclude the \u201cwhole person\nconcept\u201d against Applicant.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.  Guideline H:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a to 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2.  Guideline G:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a to 2.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 3.  Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 4.  Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 4.a to 4.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for assignment to sensitive duties.\nHis application for eligibility for an ADP I/II/III position is denied.\nPhilip S.

All of the information about this transaction is included within these  pages of the transcript.\n1\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue an ADP\nI/II/III position for Applicant. As required by Department of Defense Regulation 5200.2-R (Jan.\n1987), as amended (Regulation), and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 \u00b6 E3.1.2 (Jan. 2,\n1992), as amended (Directive), DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on November 1, 2006.\nIt detailed the basis for its decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (financial\nconsiderations) of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on December 29, 2005, and\nimplemented by the Department of Defense effective September 1, 2006. Applicant answered the\nSOR in writing on December 12, 2006, and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge.\nThe case was assigned to me on January 18, 2007. With the consent of the parties, I convened a\nhearing on March 20, 2007, to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the interests of national\nsecurity to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility to occupy an ADP I/II/III position. DOHA\nreceived the hearing transcript (Tr.) on March 30, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant is 63 years old and has worked for a medical contractor with the federal\ngovernment as a case manager since October 2004. She has a degree in nursing and has been\nworking in the health care business since 1965. She divorced sometime in the early 1980s and raised\nher four children on her own. Her children are grown and are ages 38, 36, 32, and 31 years old. Her\nyoungest child moved out of her house two years ago. She has seven grandchildren. Her 15 year old\ngrandson has lived with her since he was approximately three years old. She receives no child\nsupport for him from either of his parents. \nApplicant has numerous delinquent debts that are not paid. She admitted she owed the debts\nlisted in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, 1.f, 1.h, 1, j, 1.k, 1.l, 1.n, 1.o, and 1.p. She denied in her answer that she\nowed the debts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.d, 1.e, 1.g, 1.i, 1.m, 1.q, and 1. r. Department Counsel\nproffered that the government had no evidence on SOR\u00b6\u00b6 1. q and 1. r. \nApplicant disputes the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a.  She stated she contracted with the creditor\n1\nsometime in 1982 or 1983 to buy her house for one dollar, when she was unable to make the\nmortgage payments. They had a written contract for the sale of the house. She stated the creditor was\nto sell her the home back for market value when she was financially able. This was an oral contract\nfor the real estate. In approximately 2002, she attempted to buy the house back, but the creditor\nwould only sell it to her for above market value. She stated she had been paying double rent for\ntwenty years. Applicant received notice that the creditor was suing her in court. She moved out of\nthe house. A judgment was obtained against Applicant and she never contacted the creditor to satisfy\nthe judgment. Applicant\u2019s brother, an attorney, was handling the matter for her. Her brother is now\ndeceased and Applicant does not know how the judgment was obtained. She never contacted the\ncreditor to discuss paying the judgment and she never contested the judgment. She sent a letter to\n\nAE C.\n2\nTr. 21, 44-47; AE G.\n3\nTr.49\n4\nTr. 52-53.\n5\nTr. 58-60.\n6\nTr 66.\n7\nTr. 70.\n8\nTr.75.\n9\n84-86.\n10\n4\nthe creditor asking him to remove the judgment from her credit report. The letter provided is\nunsigned and undated.  No other documentation was provided regarding this transaction and debt.\n2\nApplicant admits she owes the debt listed in SOR \u00b6 1.b to the IRS for taxes due in 1999.\nThere was a mistake on her taxes and she had to return a refund she received. She has paid down this\ndebt and owes approximately $1,200.  She admits the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c and stated she was going\n3\nto pay it, but had not made any payments toward the debt.  This is a credit card debt. The debts in\n4\nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.e., 1.f, 1.h, 1.j, 1.k, 1.o, and 1.p are credit card debts. The debt in SOR \u00b61.g is for a\ncomputer she purchased and fell behind in the payments.  She has not repaid this debt. Applicant\n5\nhas not made payments on any of these debts. She has no knowledge of the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.i, but\nis not disputing it.  The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.m is for a pay day loan she obtained in 2003. She has not\n6\nrepaid this debt.  The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.n was a loan that she has not repaid. She had been told by a\n7\nconsumer credit service that some of her debts were over seven years old and they would drop off\nher credit report. She does not intend on repaying these debts. She stated she did not have enough\nmoney to set up repayment plans with her creditors through the consumer credit company.  She\n8\nreceived settlement offers from the collection companies for debts SOR \u00b6 1. h and 1.l, but did not\naccept the agreement.\nAfter Applicant\u2019s husband left her, she took care of her four children. During this time, she\nreceived credit cards in the mail and used them. She has been in debt since the 1980s. She admits\nshe has never been able get out of debts since then and it is difficult for her to repay her delinquent\ndebt because she cares for her grandson and is now helping her daughter, who was recently\ndiagnosed with breast cancer. She assists her by paying some of her prescription expenses.  She\n9\nstated she has a plan to pay off her debts with a budget, but did not provide a copy.  She has $400\n10\nleft at the end of the month after paying expenses. Much of that is going to help her daughter.\nApplicant is under a great deal of stress, trying to raise her grandson and help out her daughter.

Positions\n12\ndesignated as ADP I or ADP II are classified as sensitive positions.  ADP III positions are\n13\n\u201cnonsensitive positions.\u201d  However, DOHA has been directed to apply the due process provisions\n14\nof the Directive for all trustworthiness determinations under ADP I, II, and including ADP III\npositions by a memorandum from the Deputy Undersecretary of Defense (Counterintelligence and\nSecurity) dated November 19, 2004. Thus, even though ADP III positions are nonsensitive, they are\ntreated in the same way and adjudicated under the same guidelines and procedures as ADP I and II\ncases. \n\u201cThe standard that must be met for \u2026assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all\navailable information, the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that \u2026assigning\nthe person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d  Appendix\n15\n8 of the Regulation sets forth adjudicative policy, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and\nmitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline. Department of Defense contractor personnel are\nafforded the adjudicative procedures contained in the Directive.16\n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is an acceptable security risk.\u201d  Each eligibility\n17\ndetermination  must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the relevant and material\nfacts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the factors listed in the Regulation.\nSpecifically these are: the nature, extend, and seriousness of the conduct; the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; the frequency and recency of the\nconduct; the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; the voluntariness of\nparticipation; the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; the\nmotivation for the conduct; the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.

The government\n18\nhas the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of proof is something less than a\n19\npreponderance of evidence.  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an\n20\napplicant to present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against\nhim.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance\n21\ndecision.  These same burdens of proof apply to trustworthiness determinations for ADP positions.\n22\nNo one has a right to a security clearance  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that\n23\nsecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  Any reasonable\n24\ndoubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved\nin favor of protecting such sensitive information.  The decision to deny an individual a security\n25\nclearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an\n26\nindication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of\nDefense have established for issuing a clearance.\nBased upon consideration of all the evidence, I find the following adjudicative guideline most\npertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case:\nGuideline F- Financial Considerations are a concern because failure or inability to live within\none\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual\nwho is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nCompulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes including espionage. Affluence\nthat cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a security concern. It may indicate\nproceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.\n\n7\nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those\nwhich would mitigate security concerns, pertaining to the adjudicative guideline are set forth and\ndiscussed in the conclusions below. \nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all ofthe facts in evidence and the legal standards.\nBased on all the evidence, Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) 19. (a)\n(inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) FC DC 19 (c) (a history of not meeting financial\nobligations), and FC DC 19 (d) (consistent spending beyond one\u2019s means, which may be indicated\nby excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-to income ratio, and/or other\nfinancial analysis) apply in this case. Applicant has been in debt since the 1980s and has many debts\nshe is unwilling and unable to pay. She has decided not to pay some debts and to let the seven year\nstatute of limitation run so they will no longer be on her credit report. She irresponsibly used credit\ncards and failed to pay them.  She does not have a realistic plan or budget to repay her delinquent\ndebts.\nI have considered all of the Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC), and\nespecially considered FC MC 20 (a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment), FC MC 20 (b) (the conditions\nthat resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances), FC MC 20 (c) (the person received\nor is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being\nresolved or is under control), FC MC 20 (d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay\noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts), and FC MC 20 (e) (the individual has a reasonable\nbasis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides\ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve\nthe issue. \nApplicant\u2019s debts are recent and remain unpaid. She has made minimal effort to repay them.\nShe has a long history of indebtedness. FC MC 20 (a) does not apply. Applicant ran into financial\nproblems when she divorced in the 1980's and was caring for her children. These conditions were\nbeyond her control. Her children are now all grown and in their thirties. It has been more than 20\nyears since her divorce. She cares for her grandson. She recently began helping her ill daughter. These\nactions are admirable, but were not the primary cause of her financial situation. Her financial\nproblems have been ongoing for many years, with little progress towards resolution. Although she\nstates she intends to pay her debts, she did not provide a plan to do so. She made a poor financial\ndecision regarding her house, but that is just one of many debts. She has decided to not repay certain\ndebts. I find FC MC 20 (b) does not apply. \nApplicant sought the assistance of a debt consolidator, but could not meet the payments. She\nhas not sought any other financial counseling. There are no indications that her financial problems\nare being resolved or under control. I find FC MC 20 (c) does not apply. She is repaying her debt to\n\n8\nthe IRS, but there are no indications that she has a realistic plan on resolving her other debts. Hence,\nFC MC 20 (d) does not apply. Applicant disputes the judgment against her regarding her real estate\ntransaction, but has not provided any documentation to substantiate she is not responsible. It is not\nreasonable to believe that after selling her house for one dollar she would be able to buy it back\ntwenty years later based on an oral promise. Therefore, I find FC MC 20 (e) does not apply. \nThe Whole Person\nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The\nobjective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a person's\nlife to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance. Indeed,\nthe adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in considering the \u201cwhole\nperson\u201d concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of their acts, omissions,\nmotivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful\nanalysis.\nI considered the whole person in evaluating the case. I considered all of the evidence presented\nin the case. I have considered Applicant\u2019s divorce and responsibility in raising her children on her\nown caused her financial hardships. That she is caring for her grandson and provides assistance to her\ndaughter. Applicant has had many years to work on repaying her overdue debts, but has chosen to\nignore them and wait for them to be removed from her credit report. She does not have a realistic or\nviable plan resolving her debts. Applicant has demonstrated a lack of good judgment and reliability\nover many years in how she handled her finances. Therefore, I am persuaded by the totality of the\nevidence in this case, that it is clearly not consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a\nsecurity clearance. Accordingly, Guideline F is decided against Applicant.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.

LEONARD\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nJames F. Duffy, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\n\n Executive Order 10865, dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive 5220.6, dated January 2,\n1\n1992, as amended (Directive).\n See Memorandum from the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, dated August 30, 2006, Subject:\n2\nImplementation of Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (December\n29, 2005). \n2\nApplicant has drunk-driving convictions in 1989 and 2005, and he continues to drink alcohol.\nHe has a history of financial problems, including a defaulted student loan. He has not presented\nsufficient information to explain, extenuate, or mitigate the combined effect of the alcohol\nconsumption and financial considerations security concerns. Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny or revoke his eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order and DoD Directive,  the Defense\n1\nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant on\nDecember 8, 2006. The SOR\u2014which is equivalent to an administrative complaint\u2014details the\nfactual basis for the action and alleges security concerns under Guideline G for alcohol consumption,\nGuideline H for drug involvement, and Guideline F for financial considerations. Applicant timely\nreplied to the SOR and requested a hearing. \nIn addition to the Directive, this case is brought under the revised Adjudicative Guidelines\nfor Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information approved by the President on\nDecember 29, 2005. The revised guidelines were then modified by the Defense Department, effective\nSeptember 1, 2006. They supersede or replace the guidelines published in Enclosure 2 to the\nDirective and Appendix 8 to DoD Regulation 5200.2-R, and they apply to all adjudications and other\ndeterminations where an SOR has been issued on September 1, 2006, or thereafter.  They apply to\n2\nthis case because the SOR is dated December 8, 2006. Both the Directive and the Regulation are\npending formal amendment. At the hearing, Applicant acknowledged that the revised guidelines\nwould apply to his case (R. 13). \nThe case was assigned to me January 26, 2007. A notice of hearing was issued scheduling\nthe hearing for March 7, 2007. The hearing took place as scheduled. DOHA received the hearing\ntranscript March 15, 2007.\nAt Applicant\u2019s request, the record was kept open until March 23, 2007, to allow him to\nsubmit additional documentary evidence. He submitted several matters in a timely manner and those\nmatters were forwarded to me by department counsel who voiced no objections. His multi-part\nsubmission, as described in the forwarding document, is admitted as Exhibit C.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\n\n3\nApplicant admits the SOR allegations, and his admissions are incorporated herein. I make\nthe following findings of fact set forth below in numbered paragraphs. \n1.\nApplicant is a 39-year-old senior analyst whose day-to-day duties involve network-server\nmanagement. He earned an associate\u2019s degree in applied science and electronics in 1995. He has\nworked for his current employer since March 2004. His annual salary is about $50,000. Applicant\nis unmarried and has no children. He is seeking a DoD security clearance for the first time, and he\ncompleted a security-clearance application in November 2004 (Exhibit 1).\n2.\nApplicant has a history of financial problems. As part of the background investigation, a\ncredit report was obtained in December 2004 (Exhibit 4). The public record section of the report\nrevealed one satisfied judgment for $677 and one unpaid judgment for $676. The trade section of\nthe report revealed 16 accounts of which only 3 accounts did not have a negative account history.\nThe collections section of the report revealed three unpaid collection accounts. An additional credit\nreport was obtained in November 2006, and this report further revealed or confirmed Applicant\u2019s\nunfavorable financial history.\n3.\nThe SOR alleges and Applicant does not dispute that he is indebted to multiple creditors for\nmore than $25,000. This total includes about $13,357 on a defaulted student loan. The accounts are\ndiscussed below.\n4.\nSOR subparagraph 3.a concerns a judgment taken against Applicant for $1,641 in January\n2005. Applicant was sued by a former landlord for past rent and damages to a property he rented\n(Exhibit C at 2\u20135). In lieu of execution of the judgment, Applicant agreed to make payment of $500\nper month on the first day of February, March, April, and May 2005. At the hearing, Applicant\nrepresented that he made the four payments. He also presented documentary proof that he made two\nof the four payments (Exhibits B and C at 6\u20138). To show proof of payment, he attempted to contact\nthe landlord and attorney who represented the landlord (Exhibit C at 9\u201314). Based on Applicant\u2019s\ncredible testimony and the documentary evidence, I find this judgment is now paid.\n5.\nSOR subparagraph 3.b concerns a $180 collection account stemming from a telephone\naccount. Applicant resolved this account by paying $202 to the collection agency in February 2007\n(Exhibits A and C at 15). \n6.\nThe next four delinquent debts (SOR subparagraphs 3.c, 3.d, 3.e, and 3.g) concern three\ncollection accounts and one charged-off account for $662, $6,507, $1,145, and $2,215. To resolve\nthese four debts, Applicant obtained assistance from a credit-counseling organization (Exhibit C at\n16\u201326). On March 14, 2007, he agreed to a debt-management plan (DMP) wherein he will make a\nsingle monthly payment with the first payment due April 5, 2007.\n7.\nConcerning the defaulted student loan debt alleged in SOR subparagraph 3.f, Applicant has\nrecently entered into a loan-rehabilitation program in January 2007 (Exhibit C at 27\u201329). The\nbalance due has increased from the amount alleged in the SOR. As of January 30, 2007, the amount\ndue on the loan was $29,565. To rehabilitate the loan, Applicant agreed to make $200 payments on\nthe 30  of each month beginning January 30, 2007, until the minimum of nine consecutive payments\nth\nare made. If he makes the required nine payments, his loan will be eligible for rehabilitation and his\n\n4\naccount may be considered for purchase by an eligible lender. So far, he has made payments in\nJanuary and February. \n8.\nConcerning his overall financial situation, Applicant describes his current situation as living\npaycheck-to-paycheck (R. 54). He has no money in the bank, about $2,000 to $3,000 in a retirement\naccount, and his checking account has a typical balance of $200 to $500. He has no regular savings\nprogram, and he does not participate in his employer\u2019s 401(k) retirement savings plan. After a car\naccident in 2004, he bought a sports car for about $24,000 and is making $459 monthly payments\non the loan. In addition, he is making monthly loan payments of $377 for a motorcycle. He was\nunemployed from February 2000 until August 2000, and he has since been continuously employed.\n9.\nApplicant has two drunk-driving offenses on his record. The first took place in 1989 when\nhe was charged with operating a vehicle under the influence. He was found guilty and sentenced to\n90 days in jail (88 days suspended), and ordered to pay a fine and costs and undergo an alcohol\nevaluation. In addition, he was placed on probation for one year. His second took place in 2004 when\nhe was involved in a car accident. In 2005, he was found guilty of driving under the influence and\nsentenced to 180 days in jail (suspended), fined $500, ordered to pay $1,301 in fees and costs, and\ndirected to attend and complete a treatment program within six months. He was placed on probation,\nwhich he completed in April 2006. \n10.\nHe received treatment or counseling for his alcohol use from May 2005 to November 2005.\nThe services were provided by a licensed clinical social worker who requested Applicant attend\nAlcoholics Anonymous during this period. There is no evidence that Applicant has received an\nevaluation or diagnosis of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence.  \n11.\nApplicant continues to use alcohol. Since his last drunk-driving offense, he estimates\ndrinking alcohol about two to four times a month on the weekends (R. 33). He estimates drinking\ntwo to five beers per setting and he may have a vodka drink on occasion. He denies being drunk\nsince the 2004 incident, and he denies drinking-and-driving since the 2004 incident. His girlfriend\ndrinks rarely, and he abstains when in her presence. His intention is to continue drinking alcohol at\na very moderate level. He has a valid driver\u2019s license issued by his state of residence. It has an\nexpiration date of February 2011, and he has no restrictions on his driving privileges (R. 51). \n12.\nSometime in 2003, Applicant used the drug Zoloft when he was feeling down (R. 38\u201339).\nHe did not have a valid prescription to use it, nor did he use it per doctor\u2019s orders. At the time, he\nwas taking a generic form of Prozac per a valid prescription. He obtained a single dose (one pill) of\nZoloft from a friend, took it, and did not like how it made him feel. He has had no other improper\nuse of legal drugs, and he has had no involvement with illegal drugs.  \nPOLICIES\nThe Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a person\u2019s\nsecurity clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions\n(MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial\ncommonsense decision based upon consideration of all the relevant and material information, the\n\n Directive, Enclosure 2, \u00b6 E2.2.1 (setting forth nine factors to consider under the whole-person concept).\n3\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n4\n ISCR Case No. 96-0277 (App. Bd.

Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10  Cir. 2002) (\u201cIt is likewise plain that there\nth\nis no \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance, so that full-scale due process standards do not apply to cases such as Duane\u2019s.\u201d).\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.\n11\n5\npertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-person concept.  A person granted access\n3\nto classified information enters into a special relationship with the government. The government\nmust be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in those persons to whom it grants access\nto classified information. The decision to deny a person a security clearance is not a determination\nof an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination that the applicant has not met the strict\n4\nguidelines the President has established for granting eligibility for a security clearance.\nBURDEN OF PROOF\nThe only purpose of a security-clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an applicant.  There is no\n5\npresumption in favor of granting or continuing access to classified information.  The government\n6\nhas the burden of presenting evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been\ncontroverted.  An applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or\n7\nmitigate facts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate burden\n8\nof persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.9\nNo one has a right to a security clearance.  As noted by the Supreme Court in Department\n10\nof Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations\nshould err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the\n11\nDirective, any doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information\nwill be resolved in favor of protecting national security.\nCONCLUSIONS\n1.\nThe Alcohol Consumption Concern\n\n6\nUnder Guideline G, excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of\nquestionable judgment or the failure to control impulses. It can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability and trustworthiness.\nHere, based on the record evidence as a whole, a security concern is raised by Applicant\u2019s\ntwo drunk-driving offenses and his history of alcohol use and treatment or counseling for the same.\nHis two drunk-driving offenses qualify as alcohol-related incidents away from work within the\nmeaning of the guideline.  \nI reviewed the MC under the guideline and conclude none apply. But that does not mean\nother matters may not mitigate the concern. Here, we have an individual with two drunk-driving\noffenses separated by several years with no other alcohol-related incidents away from work or at\nwork. He has not received an evaluation or diagnosis of alcohol abuse or dependence. He  completed\nthe court-ordered treatment in 2005, and he completed his last probation in 2006. His girlfriend\ndrinks rarely, and he abstains when in her company. It does not appear that Applicant is an alcoholic\nunable to control or moderate his alcohol consumption.  \n2.\nThe Drug Involvement Concern\nUnder Guideline H, use of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. It may impair judgment and it may raise\nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\nHere, based on the record evidence as a whole, a security concern is raised by Applicant\u2019s\none-time misuse of a prescription drug in 2003. His misuse qualifies as drug abuse within the\nmeaning of the guideline.\nI reviewed the MC under the guideline and conclude this matter is fully mitigated. His\nmisuse of a single dose of Zoloft was an isolated incident that took place more than three years ago.\nThere is no other evidence of improper or illegal drug involvement. Given these circumstances,\nApplicant\u2019s  one-time misuse of Zoloft is unlikely to recur and it no longer casts doubt on his current\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. Accordingly, Guideline H is decided for Applicant.\n3.\nThe Financial Considerations Concern \nUnder Guideline F, a concern typically exists due to significant unpaid debts. Failure or\ninability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor\nself-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can\nraise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified\ninformation. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal\nor unethical acts to generate funds to meet financial obligations. Similarly, an individual who is\nfinancially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly\nhandling and safeguarding classified information.   \nHere, based on the record evidence as a whole, a security concern is raised by significant\nunpaid debts. Applicant has a well-established history of financial problems, including a defaulted\nstudent loan. His derogatory financial history is a security concern because it indicates an inability\n\n7\nor unwillingness to satisfy debts and a history of not meeting financial obligations within the\nmeaning of the guideline.\nI reviewed the MC under the guideline and conclude he receives some credit in mitigation.\nEach MC is briefly summarized and discussed below.\nThe first MC\u2014the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur\u2014does not apply. His financial problems are ongoing, and\nhis financial problems involved multiple delinquent debts. Although his financial problems may have\nbegun when he was unemployed for several months in 2000, sufficient time has since passed so that\nhis unemployment is no longer a valid factor. It is too soon to say that his financial problems are\nunlikely to recur. \nThe second MC\u2014the conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the\nperson\u2019s control\u2014does not apply. Although his financial problems may have begun in 2000 when\nhe was unemployed, the evidence does not support a conclusion that Applicant acted reasonably\nunder the circumstances. Applicant has only recently begun to process of cleaning up his financial\nhouse. He has not acted with due diligence, and he should have done more sooner.\nThe third MC\u2014the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or\nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control\u2014applies in part.\nApplicant is now enrolled in a DMP with a credit-counseling organization, but there are not clear\nindications that his financial problems are being resolved or are under control. The first payment on\nthe DMP was April 2007, and it is too soon to make any valid assessment.\nThe fourth MC\u2014the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts\u2014applies somewhat. Applicant paid off the judgment and a collection\naccount. In January 2007, he started a loan-rehabilitation program for his student loan. And he\nrecently started a DMP to resolve the other four debts. Taken together, his actions are sufficient to\nqualify for initiating a good-faith effort within the meaning of the guideline. \nThe fifth MC\u2014the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due\ndebt\u2014is not applicable here. \nThe sixth MC\u2014the affluence resulted from a legal source\u2014is not applicable here.\n4.\nThe Whole-Person Concept\nI have also considered this case in light of the whole-person concept. Viewing the record\nevidence as a whole, the combined effect of his two alcohol-related incidents and his history of\nfinancial problems paints a picture of irresponsible behavior and questionable judgment. These\ncircumstances militate against granting Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.\nDespite his drunk-driving convictions as well as court-ordered  treatment or counseling for\nhis alcohol use, he continues to drink alcohol. Although his frequency of consumption is relatively\nlow (two to four times per month), his rate of consumption is not relatively low (two to five beers\n\n8\nper setting). Continuing to consume alcohol at these levels is of some concern given his history of\nalcohol-related incidents because it creates the potential for recurrence of similar conduct.  \nIn addition to his alcohol-related incidents, his financial problems do not speak well for his\ntrustworthiness and judgment. Including the balance of his defaulted student loan as of January 2007,\nhe now has about $40,000 in bad debt. Despite his long-standing indebtedness, he took on loan\npayments of more than $800 per month for a sports car and motorcycle. This indicates he did not\nconsider paying off his past creditors to be much of a priority. He has only recently begun the process\nof resolving his indebtedness. He is two payments into the loan-rehabilitation program for his student\nloan and he has just started the DMP for his other debts. It is premature to conclude that Applicant\nwill follow through and establish a proven track record of financial responsibility. This will only\nhappen when Applicant chooses a sound financial lifestyle that is not based on borrowing and\nconsuming beyond his means and ability to repay. \nAfter weighing the favorable and unfavorable evidence, I conclude that Applicant has not\npresented sufficient information to explain, extenuate, or mitigate the combined effect of the alcohol\nconsumption and financial considerations security concerns. Likewise, he has not met his ultimate\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nHere are my conclusions for each allegation in the SOR:\nSOR \u00b6 1\u2013Guideline G:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs a, b, & d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph c:\nFor Applicant\nSOR \u00b6 2\u2013Guideline H:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph a:\nFor Applicant\nSOR \u00b6 3\u2013Guideline F:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs a\u2013g:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the facts and circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. Clearance is denied.  \nMichael H. Leonard\nAdministrative Judge \n",
