[Decision at 8.] \nIn his appeal brief, Applicant contends the Judge erred in his adverse formal findings \nregarding Applicant\u2019s alleged failure to file timely Federal income tax returns for 2020 and 2021 \nand Applicant\u2019s delinquent debt to Federal Government for about $2,500.

He is also claiming the \nFederal debt is the result of fraud, i.e., someone forged his signature on a promissory note without \nhis knowledge. Applicant, however, did not raise this fraud claim at the hearing. His credit report \nof September 2022 (Government Exhibit 4) establishes the Federal debt. Furthermore, he admitted \nthat he owed this debt at the hearing but was unsure of the amount owed.  Tr. at 70-71 and 94-96. \nFrom our review of the record, the Judge\u2019s material findings and conclusions regarding these \nallegations are based on substantial evidence or constitute reasonable inferences that could be \ndrawn from the evidence. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-02225 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 25, 2019). We \nfind the Judge committed no harmful error in reaching those adverse formal findings. \nApplicant also contends that he is in the process of making payment arrangements for two \nof the remaining debts and that he reached out to a third creditor for a payment arrangement but \nwas unable to afford the proposed amount. As the Appeal Board has previously stated, a statement \nof intent or promise to take remedial steps regarding delinquent debts in the future is not evidence \nof reform or rehabilitation. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 99-0447 at 3 (Jul. 25, 2000). None of \nApplicant\u2019s arguments are enough to rebut the presumption that the Judge considered all of the \nrecord evidence or to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, \ncapricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 21-01169 at 5 (App. Bd. May 13, 2022). \nApplicant failed to establish that the Judge committed any harmful error. The Judge \nexamined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision.

On \nJune 13, 2022, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that \ndecision\u2015security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the National \nSecurity Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) in Appendix A of Security Executive Agent Directive 4 \n(effective June 8, 2017) and DoD Directive 5220.6 (January 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). \nApplicant requested a hearing. In an undated SOR amendment, the original two SOR allegations \nwere revised, and nine other Guideline F allegations were added. Applicant answered the amended \nSOR on March 7, 2023. On September 14, 2023, after the record closed, Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals Administrative Judge Eric H. Borgstrom denied Applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility. Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. For reasons \nstated below, we affirm the Judge\u2019s decision. \nAs amended, the SOR alleged that Applicant failed to file Federal and state income tax \nreturns from 2013 to 2020 as required; that he owed the Federal Government over $9,000 in \ndelinquent taxes for 2015 through 2019; and that he had four judgments filed against him totaling \nabout $7,000.

He denied a judgment totaling about $1,200. The Judge found in favor of Applicant on a \njudgment totaling about $960 and against him on the other allegations. In summarizing the case, \nthe Judge stated: \nApplicant has filed his previously unfiled tax returns, largely resolved his tax \nliabilities, and paid four judgments. Notwithstanding his recent efforts, he \nknowingly and willfully violated Federal tax laws for about eight years. His actions \ndo not reflect the good judgment, reliability, and adherence to laws and regulations \nrequired of one entrusted to safeguard classified information. Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. [Decision at 1.] \nOn appeal, Applicant claims that he was given misleading or conflicting information about \nhis tax delinquencies. In this regard, he states, \u201cI was supposed to be given the opportunity to \nmitigate the failure to file with an explanation, and repeatedly I was told, in essence, it is both \nagainst the law, and there are no repercussions of any real harm; therefore my apprehension/fear \nwas unfounded. That simply isn\u2019t true.\u201d Appeal Brief at 2. Regarding this issue, the Judge found \nthat, in October 2021, an \u201cIRS representative disabused [Applicant] of his belief about being \njailed\u201d for being unable to pay his tax liability. Decision at 5. To the extent that Applicant is \narguing that his fear of being jailed justified or mitigated his failure to file his income tax returns \nor to pay his taxes as required, we do not find that argument persuasive. A judge is responsible for \nevaluating the evidence, determining its weight, and drawing conclusions about pertinent issues. \nNone of Applicant\u2019s arguments are enough to establish that any of the Judge\u2019s conclusions in this \ncase were arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.3. \nApplicant challenges the Judge\u2019s finding that he owed about $300 in state taxes for 2013. \nAs support for this assertion of error, Applicant points to his unsigned and undated 2013 state tax \nreturn that reflects he owed no additional income taxes for that year. Applicant Exhibit (AE) EE1 \nat 3. The Judge found that Applicant filed this tax return in late July 2022. Decision at 5. In his \nappeal brief, Applicant also claims that he spoke with a state tax authority who assured him that \nhe owed nothing further for 2013. On the other hand, a state tax transcript for 2013, which reflects \na \u201cprocess date\u201d of August 5, 2022, indicates that Applicant still owed $336 in state taxes for that \nyear. AE GG1 at 4. A Judge is tasked to resolve apparent conflicts in the evidence. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 14-00281 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 30, 2014). From our review of the evidence, we find no \nerror in the Judge\u2019s finding that Applicant still owed state income taxes for 2013. It also merits \nnoting that Applicant\u2019s 2013 state tax debt is of minor significance because it was not alleged in \nthe amended SOR. \nApplicant also challenges some of Department Counsel\u2019s questions, comments, or \narguments but fails to show that any of those statements resulted in harmful error. He asserts that \nthe amended SOR alleged \u201cwildly inaccurate\u201d amounts owed to the IRS, that Department Counsel \n\u201chad to send it three times, because she kept making mistakes,\u201d and that it made assertions \nprefaced with the phrase, \u201cAs of the date of this SOR,\u201d but it was not dated. Appeal Brief at 3. \nThese assertions of error do not merit any relief. In responding to the amended SOR, Applicant \nadmitted each of the Federal tax debt allegations without submitting any comments. His \nadmissions established those allegations. Additionally, there is no reason to conclude that \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n               \n                   \n                                                 \n                              \n \n \n            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant was prejudiced by any purported errors in the amended SOR that were eventually \ncorrected. \nIn short, none of Applicant\u2019s assertions in his appeal brief establish that the Judge \ncommitted any harmful error. The Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a \nsatisfactory explanation for the decision. The decision is sustainable on the record. \u201cThe general \nstandard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the \nnational security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v.

Applicant failed to report this incident to his \nfacility security officer or employer. The charge was later dismissed by entry of nolle prosequi. \nApplicant completed another SCA in 2017 wherein he denied having been arrested at all \nin the prior seven years and also denied having ever been charged with an offense involving \nalcohol. At hearing, he testified that the foregoing charges were not reported as required because \nthey were dismissed. During a 2018 security clearance interview, Applicant again initially denied \nhaving ever been charged with an offense involving alcohol until confronted with the 2000 arrest \nrecord, at which time he admitted the charge and expressed that he did not disclose his prior arrests \nin his 2017 SCA because the information had been previously provided in his initial security \nclearance investigation and 10-year renewal process. He testified at hearing that he did not \nvolunteer the information about his arrests during the interview because he thought he only had to \ndisclose convictions. The Judge did not find Applicant\u2019s explanation regarding his failure to \ndisclose the 2013 arrest credible. \nIn February 2019, Applicant was arrested for DUI after his car was observed still running \nwith its hazard lights on, parked half on grass and half on pavement, and Applicant was slumped \nin his seat. The police officer was unable to conduct a field sobriety test because Applicant was \ntoo intoxicated, and he refused a breathalyzer. During his December 2021 clearance interview, \nApplicant reported that he entered a pretrial diversion program for this charge, during which he \nwas required to be regularly tested for alcohol consumption and to attend alcohol awareness class \nthrough Alcoholics Anonymous (AA). \nApplicant participated in another clearance interview in May 2019 for which the \ninvestigator reported that Applicant denied having ever been arrested or charged with an alcohol-\nrelated offense. Applicant contests this reporting, asserting instead that he told the investigator he \nhad been charged but not convicted with such an offense. At the time of his May 2019 interview, \nthe February 2019 DUI charge had not been adjudicated. Applicant told the investigator that this \ntype of incident was unlikely to recur because he does not drink and drive. \nApplicant was arrested for DUI again in June 2020 and January 2021. During the 2020 \nincident, he was found passed out in the driver\u2019s seat of his car at a traffic light. A breathalyzer \nreflected his blood alcohol content (BAC) was .24%. During the 2021 incident, Applicant failed a \nfield sobriety test and was reported to have a .11% BAC. He entered a pretrial diversion program \nfor the 2021 charge, during which he was required to complete a 12-week alcohol rehabilitation \nclass and regularly test for alcohol consumption. Applicant successfully completed the \nrehabilitation class, and the director of the class testified that Applicant was a model student and \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \noccasionally stops by the class and inspire current participants. Applicant testified that he is an \nalcoholic and no longer consumes alcohol. He has not attended AA since completing the diversion \nprogram for his 2021 arrest, although he maintains regular contact with his cousin who is a \nrecovering alcoholic and acted as Applicant\u2019s sponsor while he attended court-ordered classes. \nUnder Guidelines G, E, and J, the SOR cross-alleged Applicant\u2019s arrests for DUI in 2000, \n2013, 2019, 2020, and 2021. Additionally, under Guideline E, the SOR alleged that Applicant \ndeliberately failed to disclose the 2000 arrest as required on his 2007 SCA, deliberately failed to \ndisclose the 2000 and 2013 arrests on his 2017 SCA, and deliberately failed to disclose the 2000 \nand 2013 arrests during his 2018 security clearance interview. \nThe Judge found that Applicant\u2019s five DUI arrests supported application of Guideline G \ndisqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a) and 22(c). Although he testified that he had not consumed \nalcohol since July 2021 and did not intend to be involved in any further alcohol-related incidents, \nhe made similar assertions prior to his DUI arrests in 2020 and 2021. Moreover, Applicant\u2019s recent \nacknowledgement that he has an alcohol problem is of limited mitigation because he has not \nattended AA since completing the court-ordered program and there is \u201climited corroboration as to \nhim being involved in a structured support system.\u201d Decision at 11. The Judge concluded that \ninsufficient time had passed to determine that Applicant\u2019s alcohol-related behavior is unlikely to \nrecur in the future. She concluded similarly under her Guideline J analysis. \nTurning to the Guideline E allegations, the Judge found the evidence insufficient to \nconclude that Applicant deliberately provided false information about his 2000 arrest during the \n2018 interview and resolved that portion of SOR \u00b6 2.e in Applicant\u2019s favor. She went on to find, \nhowever, that Applicant\u2019s explanations for the remaining failures to disclose \u2013 that he believed he \ndid not have to disclose his arrests and charges because he was not convicted \u2013 were not credible \nand ruled against him on all other Guideline E falsification allegations. The Judge also found that \nApplicant\u2019s five DUI arrests amounted to conduct that \u201ccreates a vulnerability to exploitation, \nmanipulation, or duress by a foreign intelligence entity or other individual or group\u201d and \nestablished disqualifying condition AG \u00b6 16(e). \nDiscussion \nOn appeal, Applicant first challenges the Judge\u2019s finding that he was untruthful during the \nvarious stages of his multiple security clearance investigations, arguing that his evidence \nestablished that he did not deliberately provide false answers. With respect to the falsification \nallegations, the Judge \u201cdid not find Applicant credible that he believed he did not have to disclose \nhis arrests and charges because he was not convicted\u201d and concluded that Applicant deliberately \nfailed to disclose the information. Id. at 9. The Judge provided robust findings regarding \nApplicant\u2019s multiple, repeated failures to disclose information plainly and explicitly during his \ninvestigations, and she sufficiently explained why, based on the complete record, she found his \nexplanations to be incredible. The Board gives deference to such credibility determinations, and \nwe find no cause to disturb the Judge\u2019s determination in this matter.

The record \nreflects that the conditions of the diversion program for Applicant\u2019s 2020 DUI included that he \n\u201cmust attend and complete any and all treatment recommended by the Court Referral Officer.\u201d \nGovernment Exhibit 12. Court records further reflect that, pursuant to his diversion program \nconditions for both the 2020 and 2021 arrests, Applicant completed level II of the court-ordered \nalcohol treatment program in January 2022 and level III of the program in March 2023. See \nApplicant Exhibit (AE) F; AE I. The Judge\u2019s finding that Applicant\u2019s participation in alcohol \nrehabilitation classes was court-ordered is therefore supported by the record.1 \nApplicant next argues that the Judge\u2019s mitigation analysis overlooked his successful \nparticipation in the alcohol rehabilitation program and more than two years of sobriety. This \nargument amounts to a disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of evidence, which is not sufficient \nto demonstrate that the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is \narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. See ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, \n2007). \nFinally, Applicant argues that, in the more than 15 years that he has worked for DoD, he \nhas never mishandled classified information and he is therefore not a threat to national security. \nSecurity clearance adjudications are predictive in nature, and it is foreseeable that individuals with \nprior good records may nevertheless engage in conduct or undergo circumstances that raise doubts \nabout their future judgment or reliability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-04927, 2005 WL 1382028 \nat *5 (App. Bd. Mar. 4, 2005) (citing Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528-529 \n(1988)). The Government need not wait until an individual mishandles classified information \nbefore it can make an unfavorable security clearance decision. Id. (citing Adams v. Laird, 420 F.2d \n230, 238-239 (D.C. Cir. 1969), cert. denied, 397 U.S. 1039 (1970)). Rather, an unfavorable \nclearance decision can be based on circumstances that raise security concerns sufficient to preclude \na determination that it is clearly consistently with the national interest to grant or continue a \nsecurity clearance for a given applicant, such as a significant history of alcohol-related arrests and \nfalsification of security clearance application materials. \nApplicant failed to establish that the Judge committed any harmful error. The Judge \nexamined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for her decision, and the \nrecord evidence is sufficient to support the Judge\u2019s findings and conclusions. The decision is \nsustainable on this record. \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \n\u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 528. \u201cAny doubt \nconcerning personnel being considered for national security eligibility will be resolved in favor of \nthe national security.\u201d Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6 2(b). \n1 To the extent that Applicant is arguing that his occasionally stopping by his former rehabilitation class to speak to \ncurrent attendees or his ongoing contact with his cousin constitutes continued voluntary alcohol treatment, we do not \nfind these arguments persuasive or sufficient to determine the Judge\u2019s finding was erroneous. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOrder \nThe decision is AFFIRMED. \nSigned: Moira Modzelewski \nMoira Modzelewski \nAdministrative Judge \nChair, Appeal Board \nSigned: Gregg A.

On \nJuly 8, 2022, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that \ndecision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse) \nof the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) in Appendix A of Security Executive Agent \nDirective 4 (effective Jun. 8, 2017) and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as \namended) (Directive). Applicant requested a decision on the written record. On January 13, 2023, \nafter considering the record, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative \nJudge Charles C. Hale denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. Applicant appealed \npursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant used marijuana with varying frequency from about \nNovember 2015 to about July 2021, including after he was granted access to classified information \nin about April 2020; and that he was arrested for possession of marijuana in about September 2020. \nIn responding to the SOR, Applicant admitted both allegations without providing any mitigating \nevidence.

As the Board has \npreviously stated, how particular fact scenarios were decided at the hearing level in other cases is \ngenerally not a relevant consideration in our review of a case.

Applicant is fully aware of the impact that delinquent debt has on his security \neligibility, but \u201chas not done sufficient work to resolve the issue.\u201d Id. at 7. \nApplicant\u2019s appeal brief suggests that the Judge failed to consider matters beside his credit \nhistory and that he felt as if he lacked a fair chance at the hearing to gain clearance eligibility. He \nalso argues that he has been working on his credit report and will continue to do so, including by \nfiling bankruptcy in the future. \nThere is no reason to believe that the Judge did not consider all of the record evidence or \nApplicant\u2019s testimony at the hearing. There is a rebuttable presumption that the Administrative \nJudge considered all of the record evidence, and the appealing party has a heavy burden when \ntrying to rebut that presumption. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 18-00110 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 31, 2020). \nApplicant\u2019s submission of mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a \nfavorable security clearance decision. As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as \na whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice \nversa. An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to \nargue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate that the Judge \nweighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary \nto law. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007). \nRegarding Applicant\u2019s general assertion that he did not have a fair hearing, we construe \nthis assertion as a claim that the Judge was biased against him and that he was denied due process. \nThis assignment of error is unpersuasive. There is a rebuttable presumption that a Judge is impartial \nand unbiased, and a party seeking to overcome that presumption has a heavy burden of persuasion. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-02391 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 7, 2018). \nWe examined the entire record and Decision, paying particular attention to the transcript \nof the hearing. We find nothing therein that would cause a reasonable person to question the \nJudge\u2019s impartiality in this case. In fact, the record shows the Judge and Department Counsel were \ncourteous, instructive, and receptive to Applicant\u2019s testimony, and the Judge held a full and fair \nhearing. The Judge rescheduled the hearing on two occasions at Applicant\u2019s request to allow him \nto prepare and obtain representation. The Judge told Applicant he would continue the hearing for \nas long as necessary and he left the record open for Applicant to submit evidence after the hearing. \nApplicant did not submit any post-hearing documentary evidence on his behalf. Decision at 2; Tr. \nat 4-11. We find no reason to conclude that Applicant was denied the due process afforded by the \nDirective. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-10122 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Apr. 22, 2016). \nApplicant failed to establish that the Judge committed any harmful error. The Judge \nexamined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for his decision, and the \nrecord evidence is sufficient to support the Judge\u2019s findings and conclusions. The decision is \nsustainable on this record. \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \n\u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v.

He earned a commercial diving certificate in March 2021 and \nhas worked for a defense contractor since April 2021. Under Guideline J, the SOR alleged that \nApplicant was arrested three times in December 2021 and charged with offenses including \nStalking, Obstruction of Justice, Violation of Protective Order, and Assault and Battery. Applicant \nwas found guilty of the two Protective Order violation charges and sentenced to six months in jail, \nwith all but one day suspended, and was issued another Protective Order prohibiting his contact \nwith the victim.

On \nJuly 11, 2022, DoD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis of that \ndecision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline H \n(Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse) of the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) \nin Appendix A of Security Executive Agent Directive 4 (effective June 8, 2017) and DoD Directive \n5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). On August 16, 2023, Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals Administrative Judge Roger C. Wesley denied Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility. Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nThe SOR alleged two financial concerns, both of which were found favorably for \nApplicant. Under Guideline H, the SOR also alleged that Applicant used marijuana from April to \nJune 2021, at which time he tested positive for marijuana during a routine employer drug \nscreening, and that the foregoing conduct occurred after Applicant was last granted access to \nclassified information in about 2020.

Government Exhibit (GE) 5. The amount of THC in his system at the time of the test \nwas not recorded. Id. at 2. In his October 2021 security clearance application, Applicant disclosed \nthat he was fired from his job as a defense contractor in June 2021 because he tested positive for \ncannabidiol (CBD) oil. GE 1 at 18. He denied having used any illegal drugs in the prior seven \nyears or while possessing a security clearance. Id. at 41. In response to the SOR, Applicant \nadmitted testing positive for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in June 2021, but he denied both \nallegations regarding marijuana use, including that he used marijuana from April to June 2021 and \nthat he used marijuana after being granted access to classified information. He reiterated that the \npositive drug test resulted from using a CBD product that he did not realize contained THC. \nIn explanation for his CBD use, Applicant testified that, after 18 years of military service, \nhe was medically retired because he suffered from a heart condition and underwent double bypass \nsurgery. Tr. at 28-29, 33. He subsequently experienced pain throughout his body and was \nintroduced to CBD as an alternative to medications to ease inflammation and used the substance \ntopically before sleep. Id. at 23-24. Applicant testified that, in total, he purchased CBD products \ntwice from a gas station and was given a different CBD product a third time by a friend from \nColorado. Id. at 37. Applicant was unaware that the product he used contained THC until after \nreceiving his positive drug test result. Id. at 24. \nApplicant testified that he could not provide evidence of the specific CBD product that he \nused before his positive test result because, after he received the result, he threw the product away \nand cut all ties with it and the person who provided it to him. Tr. at 34, 36-38. That was two years \nprior to the hearing. Applicant further testified that he has never used illegal drugs and that this \nwas an isolated event, which has significantly impacted his life and integrity. Id. at 24. \nCiting the Agricultural Improvement Act of 2018, the Judge acknowledged that \u201clicensed \nsales of hemp-derived CBD oil is not prohibited . . . provided that the hemp-related CBD product \ncontains less than 0.3 percent of THC content.\u201d Decision at 8. The Judge noted, however, the \n\u201cgenerally recognized fact that broad spectrum CBD oil can be expected to contain almost no \nTHC, while full spectrum CBD products can [contain] up to 0.3 percent of the ingredient,\u201d1 and \ntherefore questioned Applicant\u2019s explanation that it was his ingesting CBD oil that produced the \npositive drug test result. Id. \nThe Judge also acknowledged that Applicant was supported by two colleagues, both of \nwhom attested to his dedication, sound judgment, leadership qualities, and overall good character, \nalthough neither acknowledged knowing of Applicant\u2019s June 2021 positive drug test or his claimed \nuse of CBD oil. The Judge found that Applicant had \u201ccommitted to abandoning all involvement \nwith CBD and any other substances that could potentially place him at risk to testing positive for \nmarijuana,\u201d but concluded that the passage of only two years since Applicant\u2019s positive drug test \nand his inability to document the type of CBD oil he claimed to use rendered it \u201ctoo soon to absolve \nApplicant of risks of recurrence.\u201d Id. at 8-9. \n1 The Judge cited no authority for this finding. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDiscussion \nOn appeal, Applicant asserts that the Judge both failed to properly consider all available \nevidence and applied facts not supported by the record, rendering his adverse decision arbitrary, \ncapricious, or contrary to law, and failed to properly apply the mitigating conditions and whole-\nperson analysis. Consistent with the following, we remand. \nDue Process Concerns \nIn reaching his adverse conclusion, the Judge sua sponte researched and cited to various \ngeneral sources including the Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research, the Centers \nfor Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the University of Rochester, and to a publication \nby L. Hellicar, Does cannabidiol (CBDZ) contain THC? Decision at 4. None of the cited materials, \nhowever, were actually included in the record. Rather, the record contains three undated emails \nfrom the Judge to Department Counsel and Applicant, wherein he indicates his intention to \u201ccite \nseveral articles covering CBD oil and THC content levels in marketed CBD products,\u201d including \n\u201cMayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research (2023); Data compiled by the [CDC], \nhttps://.cdc.gov; and L. Hellicar in her titled article, Does Cannabidiol (CBDZ) Contain THC in \nhttps://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/does-cbd-have-thc.\u201d The Judge did not attach any of \nthe referenced materials to the emails. Additionally, he requested that parties respond within five \ncalendar days with any objection or comment, but the record contains no information regarding \nresponses from either party. \nSeveral problems arise from the Judge\u2019s handling of these sources. First, there is no \nevidence that Applicant or the Government received any notice of the Judge\u2019s intention to rely on \nmaterial from the University of Rochester, as cited in the decision; that they received sufficiently \nspecific notice of the materials relied upon from the Mayo Foundation or the CDC; that they \nreceived copies of any of the relied-upon materials; or whether either party objected to or \ncommented on the sources or the Judge\u2019s intention to rely upon them. \nWhile a judge may sua sponte take administrative notice of facts pertinent to a case, such \naction generally requires prior, specific notice to the parties and an opportunity to respond. See, \ne.g., DISCR OSD Case No. 90-1550 at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 1992). Compare ISCR Case No. 08\u00ad\n09480 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 17, 2010) (Judge\u2019s reliance on statute, without quoting it verbatim or \notherwise identifying it with sufficient specificity to determine its content, was an error), and ISCR \nCase No. 99-0511 at 6 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2000) (administrative notice of foreign law would \nrequire prior, specific notice to the parties), with ISCR Case No. 02-29739 at 5 (App. Bd. Oct. 13, \n2005) (Judge\u2019s introduction of a definition into factual findings did not require prior notice to the \nparties). Here, the Judge technically informed the parties of his intention to take administrative \nnotice of three of the four referenced materials; however, the vague and general nature of that \nnotification was insufficient to provide the parties with notice of the facts on which the Judge \nplanned to rely and an opportunity to meaningfully respond. \nThe Judge also erred in failing to include copies of the materials in the record. No retrieval \nlocation was provided at all for two of the four sources, and the Judge merely cited to a Uniform \nResource Locator (URL) for the remaining two sources, one of which was the CDC\u2019s main \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nwebsite. A URL is not sufficient to preserve an issue for appellate review. See, e.g., ISCR Case \nNo. 00-0628 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Apr. 26, 2002). Rather, a copy of the material or reliable retrieval \nlocation must be included in the record in order to allow the parties to argue and, if necessary, the \nAppeal Board to assess the reliability, accuracy, relevance, and appropriateness of any \nadministratively noticed fact. See ISCR Case No. 02-06478 at 6-7 (App. Bd. Dec. 15, 2003). Here, \nthe Judge\u2019s reliance on information of which the parties were not sufficiently made aware denied \nthem the ability to make reasoned arguments about whether the material was appropriate for taking \nadministrative notice and whether the inferences and conclusions drawn therefrom were \nreasonable, and now precludes the Board from assessing the same. \nThe Judge\u2019s handling of the administratively noticed materials was in error. We are \nremanding the case so that Judge may reopen the record, provide the parties with the specific \nadministrative notice documents upon which he will rely, and give them an opportunity to respond \nto those documents and submit additional evidence or argument. \nAdjudicative Desk Reference \nIn his brief, Applicant incorrectly refers to the Adjudicative Desk Reference (Version 4, \nMarch 2014) (ADR) as the \u201cAdjudicative Guidelines\u201d and cites ADR provisions in support of his \narguments. Appeal Brief at 15. Applicant\u2019s reliance upon the ADR is misplaced. DOHA judges \nare required to decide cases by using the Adjudicative Guidelines, not the ADR. The ADR itself \ncontains language indicating that it may not be cited as authority for denial or suspension of access. \nSee ADR at 2. See also ISCR Case No. 07-02253 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 28, 2008). \nCBD Products \nA Judge is tasked to resolve apparent conflicts in the evidence. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n14-00281 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 30, 2014). In this case, the record evidence presents a conflict \nregarding a critical issue (i.e., whether Applicant knowingly used or consumed an illegal drug). In \nthis regard, the Board has previously stated that a judge\u2019s decision must be written in a manner \nthat allows the parties and the Board to discern what conclusions he is reaching. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 16-02536 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 23, 2018). Based on our reading of the decision, we are \nunable to discern whether the Judge concluded Applicant unknowingly used or consumed an \nillegal drug. \nThe innocent consumption or use of an illegal drug or of a prescription medication without \na prescription does not raise security concerns under Guideline H. For example, if an applicant \nconsumes brownies laced with marijuana at a party without knowing or suspecting they contained \nmarijuana, such consumption does not raise concerns about his or her reliability, trustworthiness, \njudgment, or willingness to comply with laws and regulations and does not establish disqualifying \nconditions under Guideline H. Generally, to establish Guideline H disqualifying conditions \nregarding the use or consumption of an illegal drug, the evidence must show that an applicant \neither knew or reasonably should have known or suspected under the circumstances that the \nsubstance used was an illegal drug. In most Guideline H cases, an applicant\u2019s knowledge about \nthe nature of the alleged substance is not an issue; however, it is more likely to become an issue \nwhen the only evidence establishing the alleged use is a positive drug test. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn positive drug test cases, the burden of establishing innocent consumption will be on the \napplicant. An applicant\u2019s positive test for an illegal drug is sufficient to establish various Guideline \nH disqualifying conditions, e.g., AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), \u201cany substance misuse;\u201d 25(b), \u201ctesting positive for \nan illegal drug;\u201d and possibly others depending on the circumstances. Once a positive drug test is \nproven, an applicant has the burden to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns \narising from that positive test. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. When an applicant claims the positive drug test \nwas the result of innocent use or consumption, the key issue will likely be whether he or she \npresented sufficient evidence to prove that claim2 and thereby refute the pertinent SOR allegations. \nSuch a determination may hinge on an assessment of the applicant\u2019s credibility. If an applicant \nsuccessfully refutes the pertinent SOR allegations, those allegations should be resolved in favor of \nthe applicant, and the Judge does not need to conduct a mitigation analysis regarding them. \nA positive drug test resulting from CDB products presents further complexities because \nsome of those products are legal under Federal law while others are illegal. In December 2021, the \nSecurity Executive Agent issued Clarifying Guidance Concerning Marijuana for Agencies \nConducting Adjudications of Persons Proposed for Eligibility for Access to Classified Information \nor Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (SecEA Clarifying Guidance). This guidance discusses \nthe impact of the Agricultural Improvement Act of 2018 on CBD products and advises that \nagencies should be aware that the Federal Drug Administration does \nnot certify levels of THC in CBD products, so the percentage of \nTHC cannot be guaranteed, thus posing a concern pertaining to the \nuse of a CBD product under federal law. Studies have shown that \nsome CBD products exceed the 0.3 percent THC threshold for \nhemp, notwithstanding advertising labels . . . . Therefore, there is a \nrisk that using these products may nonetheless cause sufficiently \nhigh levels of THC to result in a positive marijuana test under \nagency-administered employment or random drug testing programs. \n[SecEA Clarifying Guidance at 3.] \nThis Guidance should be considered in assessing the merits of an applicant\u2019s claim that his or her \npositive drug test for THC was the result of innocent use of CBD products. \nIn the present case, Applicant has consistently claimed that he did not use marijuana. He \nclaims that his positive drug test for marijuana resulted from his use of CBD products and that he \nwas not aware those products were enhanced with THC. Consequently, the Judge was presented \nwith conflicting evidence. On the one hand, Applicant had a positive drug test for \u201cmarijuana\u201d \n(presumably THC) in June 2021. GE 5 at 2. On the other, Applicant claims that the positive drug \ntest was the result of his innocent use or consumption of CBD products, which he had the burden \nof proving. This was a critical issue in the case that should have been resolved because the result \n2 In the context of a positive drug test, the Government argues that the standard should be whether the applicant can \nconvincingly show \u201cthat the usage occurred under a reasonable, good-faith belief that the product was legal.\u201d Reply \nBrief at 6. We do not disagree with the use of that standard to aid in evaluating an applicant\u2019s claim of innocent use. \nWhen use of CBD is an issue, the Government understandably argues \u201cthe manner and circumstances under [which] \nthe illegal CBD [i.e., above the Federal law 0.3 % THC limit] was obtained is a significant additional consideration \nin addressing the reasonableness of the use of the product.\u201d Id. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwould likely affect the outcome of the case.

It indicates that, because she rehabilitated the student loans, DOE \nwas notifying the national credit bureaus to delete the records of default from her record, and DOE \nadvised her that she was again eligible for all of the benefits associated with the rehabilitated loans \nbefore the default. In the decision, the Judge cites to AE 12 in noting that the student loans have \nbeen transferred to a new loan servicer. Decision at 4. However, the Judge erred by failing to find \nthe student loans were rehabilitated and by concluding the loans remained delinquent. Based on \nour review of the record, we conclude these errors were harmless. See, e.g., ISCR Case No 19\u00ad\n01220 at 3 (App. Bd. Jun. 1, 2020) (an error is harmless if it did not likely affect the outcome of \nthe case). \nIn the decision, the Judge focused on the paucity of evidence regarding Applicant\u2019s efforts \nto resolve the student loans before her receipt of the SOR. The Judge noted that her total income \nwas about $106,000 in 2021 and that: \nBased on the evidence, it is clear that Applicant intentionally ignored her delinquent \nstudent loans for a substantial multi-year period.  [Decision at 8.] \n* * * \nShe described no contacts with the loan servicer or the DOE between December \n2014, when the student loans were placed in default, and July 2022, when the SOR \nwas issued.  Instead, she seemingly avoided any good-faith efforts to resolve those \ndelinquent debts.  In light of her disinterest to take such actions until the SOR was \nissued, there are lingering questions if Applicant is currently in a better position \nfinancially than she had been, as well as continuing doubt about her current \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.  [Decision at 10.] \nThe timing of an applicant\u2019s efforts to resolve debts is a relevant factor to consider in evaluating \nan applicant\u2019s case in mitigation. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-02463 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 10, \n2018).

He holds two master\u2019s degrees. He gave conflicting information regarding his \nmarital status. He stated in his security clearance application (SCA) that he first married in 1994 \nand divorced in 1999. In testimony, Applicant stated his first marriage was from 2000 to 2014. On \nhis SCA, he stated his second marriage began in June 2016, but in testimony said he was married \nfor the second time in May 2022. \nApplicant\u2019s tax difficulties began while he took deductions for a family business on his \n2012 federal income tax return that were disallowed by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), \nresulting in a large tax debt. Thereafter, Applicant did not file federal and state tax returns for tax \nyears 2014 to 2020, based on personal circumstances and not knowing how to proceed in light of \nthe 2012 federal tax debt. Although Applicant filed his federal and state tax returns in 2022, he \nhad not satisfied his 2012 federal tax debt. Applicant began the process to arrange a payment plan \nwith the IRS and made one payment in 2023. He did not submit into evidence a final payment \nplan. \nThe Judge found that Applicant\u2019s delinquent federal tax debt and failure to timely file his \n2014 to 2020 federal and state income tax returns established disqualifying conditions under \nGuideline F. He considered Applicant\u2019s apparent payment plan with the IRS and credited him with \nfiling all of his tax returns. Additionally, the Judge found that personal circumstances and business \nlosses were circumstances outside of Applicant\u2019s control. However, he noted that Applicant did \nnot document details of the plan with the IRS and determined that the IRS\u2019s disallowance of \nApplicant\u2019s 2012 deductions was not a circumstance outside of his control. The Judge concluded \nthat Applicant\u2019s delay in filing tax returns and in entering into an agreement with the IRS were not \nmitigated. \nUnder Guideline H, the Judge noted that Applicant admitted using marijuana from about \n2010 to 2022, including after he completed his 2021 SCA. Applicant used marijuana to alleviate \nback pain but stopped between 2019 and 2020 because it made him sleepy. He resumed using \nmarijuana in February and June 2022, when his pain worsened. Applicant claimed he was unaware \nof his employer\u2019s prohibition on drug use, even when permitted under state law, but he did not \ninform his employer of his drug use. He submitted an April 2023 negative drug test and \nprescription for medication to relive his back pain. \nThe Judge found Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana from 2010 to June 2022 to be disqualifying. \nHe found that, despite the negative drug test and 2023 prescription to address his reoccurring back \npain, it was too soon to determine that Applicant will discontinue his marijuana use to manage his \nback pain. The Judge held that, based on Applicant\u2019s pattern of use, his abstinence beginning in \n2022 is not sufficient to overcome his prolonged use of marijuana or to convince him that \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nrecurrence is unlikely. In addition, the frequency of use and uses after completing his SCA cast \ndoubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nOn appeal, Applicant asserts that the Judge incorrectly stated his degrees and marriages, \nfailed to properly apply the mitigating conditions, provides new evidence, and reargues his case \nfor clearance eligibility. Applicant\u2019s arguments, as discussed below, amount to a disagreement \nwith the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, which is not sufficient to demonstrate that the Judge \nweighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary \nto law. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007). \nBased on Applicant\u2019s confused presentation of his marriages in both his SCA and \nsubsequent interview, including testimony of a common law marriage that was later formally \ndocumented, the Judge did not fully and accurately account for all of his marriages. In addition, \nApplicant asserts that he has only one master\u2019s degree. These errors are not likely to have affected \nthe outcome of the Judge\u2019s decision and are therefore harmless. \nNext, Applicant asserts that he should have been credited with mitigating condition AG \u00b6 \n20(g), \u201cthe individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority to file or pay the \namount owed and is in compliance with those arrangements.\u201d He argues for greater mitigation \ncredit for filing his back tax returns and making payment arrangements with the IRS. He also \nargues that the IRS\u2019s acceptance of his suggested payment amounts to a \u201cdefacto payment \nagreement.\u201d Appeal at 1-2. Applicant\u2019s arguments are without merit. \nThe plain language of mitigating condition AG \u00b6 20(g) requires compliance with \nrepayment arrangements that have actually been established, not just attempts. Neither a \ndocumented repayment arrangement nor history of compliance therewith were satisfactorily \nestablished. Applicant was responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, \nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns arising from the admitted SOR allegations \nand he had the ultimate burden of persuasion in obtaining a favorable clearance decision. Directive \n\u00b6 E3.1.15. Even if such payment arrangement were properly established, application of AG \u00b6 20(g) \nto Applicant\u2019s case is not dispositive of the overall Guideline F determination. The presence of \nsome mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance \ndecision. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3. The Judge addressed Applicant\u2019s apparent \npayment plan with the IRS and the filing of his overdue tax returns but concluded that his delay in \nfiling those returns and in reaching an agreement with the IRS was not mitigated. \nApplicant further asserts that he had to use marijuana to address his back condition until \nhe found a doctor to treat him. He said he stopped using marijuana \u201ca number of years ago\u201d except \nfor \u201cisolated incidents.\u201d He asserts that extreme pain \u201cleft him with no choice but to use the only \npain reliever he had at his disposal,\u201d and that the Judge would have preferred that he remain \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nincapacitated and suffer. Appeal at 3. As the Appeal Board has previously stated, after applying \nfor a security clearance and being adequately placed on notice that such conduct was inconsistent \nwith holding a security clearance, an applicant who continues to use marijuana demonstrates a \ndisregard for security clearance eligibility standards, and such behavior raises substantial questions \nabout the applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 20-02974 at 6 (App. Bd. Feb. 1, 2022). Based on our review \nof the record, the Judge\u2019s conclusions regarding Applicant\u2019s marijuana use in the past and since \napplying for a security clearance are sustainable and sufficient to support denial of his security \neligibility. \nFinally, to the extent Applicant asserts new information with regard to his finances and \ndrug use, the Appeal Board is prohibited from considering new evidence on appeal. Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.29. Regarding his apparent contention that the Judge mis-weighed or did not consider record \nevidence, we find no merit in those assertions. None of his arguments are enough to rebut the \npresumption that the Judge considered all of the record evidence or to demonstrate the Judge \nweighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 22-01631 at 2 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2023). \nApplicant failed to establish that the Judge committed any harmful error. The Judge \nexamined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision. The \ndecision is sustainable on the record. \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted only \nwhen \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nPro se \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nSeptember 30, 2022, DoD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis \nof that decision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement and Substance \nMisuse) of the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) in Appendix A of Security \nExecutive Agent Directive 4 (SEAD 4) (effective June 8, 2017) and DoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. \n2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). On September 18, 2023, Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals Chief Administrative Judge Robert B. Blazewick denied Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility. Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant used marijuana from 2006 to at least January 2022 and \nintended to continue using marijuana in the future, and that she purchased marijuana from 2007 to \nat least October 2019. The Judge found against Applicant on both marijuana allegations. The SOR \nalso alleged that Applicant used cocaine and hallucinogenic mushrooms in 2012 and misused \nprescription Codeine in 2013, both of which the Judge found favorably for Applicant. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nJudge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis \nApplicant is 32 years old and has been employed as a defense contractor since 2017. She \nbegan using marijuana as a teenager when she experienced depression in high school and turned \nto marijuana and alcohol to self-medicate, finding that the former improves her mood. Prior to her \nState legalizing medical marijuana, Applicant would occasionally purchase it for personal use and \nsell small amounts to friends. Applicant obtained a medical prescription for marijuana when it \nbecame legal in her State, and stated that it helps her to feel relaxed, optimistic, and peaceful. As \nof her security clearance hearing, she had last used marijuana that morning. Applicant understood \nthat using marijuana was in violation of Federal law, and she intended to continue to use it. She \nalso stated that her employer has a policy against the use of illegal drugs and that, although the \nemployer occasionally required urinalysis and she expected she would test positive for marijuana, \nshe was not overly concerned. \nThe Judge found that \u201cApplicant\u2019s marijuana use is frequent, ongoing, and she intends to \ncontinue her use,\u201d and concluded that she did not provide sufficient evidence to mitigate the \nsecurity concerns raised by her marijuana involvement. Decision at 5, 6. \nDiscussion \nOn appeal, Applicant argues, generally, that the evidence actually established her \nreliability, trustworthiness, and willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations, rather than \nthe opposite. Appeal Brief at 1. For example, she contends that using marijuana to help with \ndepression as a teen, currently using it under a prescription, and intention to continue using it in \nthe future are \u201cthe definition of reliability,\u201d and that voluntarily disclosing her history of marijuana \nuse demonstrates her trustworthiness. Id. She also argues that the only law she breaks is \u201cthe \nfederal prohibition on a prescription medicine that\u2019s legal in [her] state.\u201d These arguments are \nwithout merit. \nDue to her stated intention to continue using marijuana, which renders her an unlawful user \nof a controlled substance, Applicant is prohibited from being granted a security clearance. See 50 \nU.S. Code \u00a7 3343(b); SEAD 4, Appendix B. \nApplicant has not established that the Judge committed harmful error or that she should be \ngranted any relief on appeal. The Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a \nsatisfactory explanation for the decision. The decision is sustainable on this record. \u201cThe general \nstandard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the \nnational security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). \u201cAny doubt \nconcerning personnel being considered for national security eligibility will be resolved in favor of \nthe national security.\u201d AG \u00b6 2(b). \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOrder \nThe decision is AFFIRMED. \nSigned: James F.

Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant received a Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge in 2013; that \nhe had two delinquent student loans totaling over $159,000; that he had seven delinquent consumer \ndebts totaling about $18,000; and that he failed to file, as required, his Federal and state income \ntax returns for 2019 and 2020.

To the extent that Applicant is contending he was denied due process, we do \nnot find any merit in that argument. When the SOR was issued, Applicant was provided a copy \nof the Directive, which sets forth the rules and procedures for adjudicating industrial security \nclearance eligibility. On November 22, 2022, the Government\u2019s File of Relevant Material \n(FORM) was mailed to Applicant. The FORM contained the Government\u2019s evidence and \narguments, and it advised Applicant that he had the opportunity to submit objections or \ndocumentary evidence in rebuttal, extenuation, mitigation, or explanation, as appropriate. It \nfurther stated, \u201cIf you do not file any objections or submit any additional information within 30 \ndays of receipt of this letter, your case will be assigned to an Administrative Judge for a \ndetermination based solely on this FORM.\u201d FORM at 3, emphasis added. Applicant did not \nsubmit a response to the FORM. The Board only has authority to remand a case (e.g., to reopen a \ncase for receipt of additional evidence) to correct an error identified in the proceeding below. \nDirective E3.1.33.2. Applicant failed to establish that he was denied any due process afforded by \nthe Directive, that any error occurred below, or that he should be granted any form of relief.  \nThe Appeal Board does not review cases de novo.  The Board\u2019s authority to review a case \nis limited to cases in which the appealing party has alleged the Judge committed harmful error. \nBecause Applicant has not alleged such a harmful error, the decision of the Judge denying \nApplicant security clearance eligibility is sustainable. \n1 The Judge failed to make a formal finding regarding SOR \u00b6 1.b.

On September \n30, 2022, Applicant signed a document acknowledging receipt of the FORM.  The FORM and its \nforwarding letter advised Applicant that he had 30 days from its receipt to file objections or submit \nany additional evidence in rebuttal, explanation, extenuation, or mitigation. His FORM response \nwas due on October 30, 2022. On an unspecified date, Applicant submitted a response to the \nFORM that consists of 30 pages.  Department Counsel had no objection to that response, and it is \nin the record. The Judge was assigned the case on December 2, 2022.  \nApplicant\u2019s appeal brief contains seven pages that he claims were submitted to DOHA but \nnot entered into the record. In support of this claim, he provided a fax verification record showing \nthat he faxed seven pages to DOHA on November 5, 2022, and he also submitted an email to \nDOHA on November 6, 2022, seeking confirmation of his fax\u2019s receipt. No response to that email \nwas provided. Even though the faxed documents in question were submitted five days after the \nFORM response deadline, those documents should have been presented to Department Counsel \nfor any objections or comments and then to the Judge for a determination as to whether they would \nbe entered into the record and considered.   \nBased on the above, we conclude the best course of action is to remand the case to the Judge \nto reopen the record to determine whether the documents Applicant submitted on November 5, 2022, \nshould have been entered in the record and considered.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nRyan C. Nerney, Esq. \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a trustworthiness \ndesignation. On July 20, 2022, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of \nthe basis for that decision \u2013 trustworthiness concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations) of DoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive) and Security \nExecutive Agent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (Dec. 10, 2016) (AG). \nApplicant requested a hearing. On March 22, 2023, after the record closed, Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals Administrative Judge Benjamin R. Dorsey denied Applicant\u2019s request for a \ntrustworthiness designation. Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nThe SOR alleged two delinquent credit card debts totaling about $36,000. The Judge found \nagainst Applicant on both allegations. On appeal, Applicant asserts that the Judge failed to properly \nconsider all available evidence, rendering his adverse decision arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to \nlaw, and failed to properly apply the mitigating conditions. Consistent with the following, we \naffirm. \n\n \n \n \n \n            \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nJudge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis \nApplicant is in his early 40s. He is twice divorced, has been married to his current wife \nsince 2017, and has three minor children. He earned his bachelor\u2019s degree in 2004 and his master\u2019s \ndegree in 2010. Applicant has worked for a defense contractor since 2020 and has also worked as \na self-employed consultant since 2017. \nApplicant explained that the credit card alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.a was used to pay for living \nexpenses, but that he became delinquent on the account in early 2020 after he began incurring \nadditional expenses following his child\u2019s autism diagnosis. He contacted the creditor in early 2022 \nand established a payment arrangement to settle the account for less than the full balance and \ncomplied with the agreement by paying approximately $19,000 towards the original delinquent \nbalance of approximately $21,000. The final settlement payment was made in January 2023. \nDecision at 2; Applicant Exhibit (AE) A. \nTurning to the debt alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.b, Applicant explained that the credit card was used \nfor travel-related expenses with an employer for whom he worked until mid-2017. He claimed to \nhave become delinquent on the account in about June 2018 following a dispute with the employer \nabout which expenses were reimbursable, and that he was further delinquent both because he lost \naccess to the account and due to his child\u2019s diagnosis. Applicant received multiple communications \nfrom the creditor notifying him that the account was delinquent and providing contact information \nto resolve the debt. In August 2022, he resolved the account, which was delinquent for \napproximately $15,000, with a single settlement payment of approximately $2,000. Decision at 2\u00ad\n3; AE C. \nThe Judge found that the SOR debts \u201cwere delinquent for years\u201d and that, while his \n\u201cexpenses initially left him unable to pay these debts,\u201d Applicant had the ability to satisfy the SOR \ndebt as of at least December 2020 when his salary increased \u201cbut chose not to until after the \nGovernment issued the SOR.\u201d Decision at 5. The Judge concluded that Applicant failed to show \nthat he resolved the debts in good faith or to establish \u201ca track record of financial responsibility \nsufficient to show that his financial delinquencies are unlikely to recur.\u201d Decision at 6. \nDiscussion \nApplicant has not challenged any of the Judge\u2019s specific findings of fact. Rather, he \ncontends that the Judge erred in failing to comply with the provisions of Executive Order 10865 \nand the Directive by not considering all the evidence, and by not properly applying the mitigating \nconditions. Applicant\u2019s arguments, as discussed more below, advocate for an alternative weighing \nof the evidence, which is not enough to show that the Judge weighed the evidence or reached \nconclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007). \nApplicant argues, for example, that mitigating condition 20(d) \u2013 \u201cthe individual initiated \nand is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts\u201d \u2013 is \n\u201cfully applicable to the facts and circumstances of this case\u201d and that the Judge failed \u201cto articulate \nany reason as to why this mitigating condition is not fully applicable given the full resolution of \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n             \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe debts at issue.\u201d Appeal Brief at 13. It is well settled that the \u201ctiming of the resolution of financial \nproblems is an important factor in evaluating an applicant\u2019s case for mitigation because an \napplicant who begins to resolve financial problems only after being placed on notice that his \nclearance was in jeopardy may lack the judgment and self-discipline to follow rules and regulations \nover time or when there is no immediate threat to his own interests.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-06440 at \n4 (App. Bd. Dec. 26, 2017). Contrary to Applicant\u2019s argument, the Judge acknowledged that \nApplicant had \u201cresolved his delinquencies by settling them for less than the full amount,\u201d but found \nthat the mitigating condition only partially applied because the resolution did not occur until after \nApplicant received his SOR. Decision at 6. The Judge\u2019s determination with respect to mitigating \ncondition 20(d) is supported by both the record and Appeal Board precedent. \nMoreover, a Judge is not obligated to make favorable findings and conclusions regarding \na debt simply because it is resolved before the close of the record. ISCR Case No. 03-04704 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2005). \u201cEvaluating the totality of the evidence in Guideline F cases, even those \nin which the applicant has actually paid his or her debts, requires consideration of the \ncircumstances underlying the debts for what they may reveal about the applicant\u2019s judgment and \nreliability.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-03019 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 5, 2017). In the instant case, the Judge \nnoted the following such circumstances: since about early 2018, Applicant\u2019s salary was at least \n$165,000 and, beginning in late 2020, his annual income has been about $390,000; his wife\u2019s \nannual income is about $200,000; as of the hearing, Applicant had approximately $50,000 to \n$100,000 in savings and several hundred thousand dollars in investment and retirement assets; \nduring the time in which the two alleged debts were delinquent, Applicant took numerous \ninternational trips for vacation and to visit family. Decision at 3. The Judge also noted that \nApplicant explained that he \u201cdid not settle his debts until after the SOR was issued because he had \nto pay for other expenses for his family,\u201d but \u201calso claimed that he has always had enough money \nto pay his debts, but he did not prioritize the SOR debts until the time he satisfied them.\u201d Decision \nat 3. The Judge clearly considered Applicant\u2019s debt resolution but concluded that, when weighed \nagainst the foregoing circumstances, the resolution alone was insufficient to mitigate the concern. \nWe find no reason to disturb the Judge\u2019s treatment of any of the mitigating conditions. \nFinally, Applicant\u2019s brief relies on hearing-level decisions in unrelated Guideline F cases \nto argue that the Judge erred in his analysis of this case. His reliance on those decisions is \nmisplaced. As the Board has previously stated, how particular fact scenarios were decided at the \nhearing level in other cases is generally not a relevant consideration in our review of a case. See, \ne.g., ISCR Case No. 19-02593 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 18, 2021). On appeal, Hearing Office decisions \nmay be useful to highlight a novel legal principle; but only in rare situations \u2013 such as separate \ncases involving spouses, cohabitants, or partners in which the debts and the financial circumstances \nsurrounding them are the same \u2013 would the adjudication outcome in another case have any \nmeaningful relevance in our review of a case. The decisions that Applicant cites have no direct \nrelationship or unique link to Applicant\u2019s case that would make them relevant here. See also ISCR \nCase No. 19-03174 at 2 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2021). \nApplicant failed to establish the Judge committed any harmful error. Based on our review \nof the record, we conclude the Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory \nexplanation for the decision. We need not agree with a Judge\u2019s decision to find it sustainable. See \nISCR Case No. 11-13965 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 6, 2013).

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nPro se \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nAugust 9, 2022, DoD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis of that \ndecision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the National \nSecurity Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) in Appendix A of Security Executive Agent Directive 4 \n(effective June 8, 2017) and DoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). On \nSeptember 7, 2023, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals Administrative Judge LeRoy F. \nForeman denied Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility. Applicant appealed pursuant to \nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nThe SOR alleged 14 financial concerns, including delinquent consumer and medical debt \ntotaling approximately $45,000. After it was originally issued, the Government amended the SOR \nto add an allegation that Applicant filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy in September 2022. In response to \nthe SOR, Applicant denied all of the alleged debts but admitted filing bankruptcy. The Judge found \nagainst Applicant on all of the allegations. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nOn appeal, Applicant challenges the Judge\u2019s finding that he \u201cfiled a petition for Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy in September 2022, more than five years after consulting with the bankruptcy lawyer.\u201d \nDecision at 3. At hearing, Applicant made inconsistent statements about when he first contacted \nthe bankruptcy lawyer.1 He now asserts that he actually first contacted the lawyer in July 2018 and \nthat, in either case, the time before filing in September 2022 was not more than five years.2 \nApplicant is correct that the passage of time between early 2018, as is noted in the decision, \nand September 2022 is just shy of five years. While the Judge\u2019s finding may be off by several \nmonths and therefore technically erroneous, the error was harmless because it did not likely affect \nthe outcome of the case. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 10-01846 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 13, 2011). If the \nfinding was intended to read that Applicant \u201ccontacted a bankruptcy lawyer in early 2017,\u201d then \nthe error would be merely typographical and the related conclusory finding that Applicant filed his \nbankruptcy petition more than five years after consulting with the lawyer would be correct. See, \ne.g., ISCR Case No. 99-0500, 2000 WL 1273961 at *2 (App. Bd. May 19, 2000) (a mere \ntypographical error in a judge\u2019s decision does not warrant remand or reversal). Either way, neither \nof the possible errors was harmful or warrants any relief on appeal. \nApplicant also takes issue with the Judge\u2019s application of the Guideline F mitigating \nconditions. For example, he argues that, after receiving the original SOR dated August 9, 2022, \nwhich alleged the 14 delinquent consumer and medical debts, he was counseled by his chain of \ncommand to resolve the issues and contacted the bankruptcy lawyer several weeks later, on August \n23. Appeal Brief at 2. In finding that mitigating condition AG \u00b6 20(d) was not established, the \nJudge correctly referenced longstanding precedent that \u201can applicant who waits until his or her \nclearance is in jeopardy before resolving debts may be lacking in the judgment expected of those \nwith access to classified information.\u201d Decision at 6, citing ISCR Case No. 16-01211 at 4 (App. \nBd. May 30, 2018). Applicant\u2019s arguments regarding the Judge\u2019s application of mitigating factors \namount to a disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, which is not sufficient to \ndemonstrate that the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is \narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. \n12, 2007). \nFinally, Applicant submits new evidence in the form of updates regarding his finances. The \nAppeal Board does not review cases de novo and is prohibited from considering new evidence on \nappeal. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29. \n1 Applicant first testified that he initially contacted the bankruptcy lawyer after his wife stopped working, which \noccurred at the end of 2017. Tr. at 33, 58. He subsequently testified that he first contacted the bankruptcy lawyer in \nearly 2017, five years before filing the petition. Tr. at 35, 38. It is unclear which of these timelines the Judge relied \nupon in making the subject finding. \n2 Applicant\u2019s assertion regarding the July 2018 contact date technically constitutes new evidence, which the Board is \nprohibited from considering on appeal.

On \nOctober 26, 2022, DoD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis of \nthat decision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) in Appendix A of Security Executive Agent \nDirective 4 (effective June 8, 2017) and DoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) \n(Directive). On September 21, 2023, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals Administrative \nJudge LeRoy F. Foreman denied Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility. Applicant appealed \npursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nApplicant, in his mid-50s, has been married to his second wife since 2014. He adopted his \ncurrent wife\u2019s three children, now all adults, to remove them from an abusive relationship, for \nwhich he incurred substantial legal expenses. Applicant has been employed by his current defense \ncontractor employer since 2021 and currently holds a security clearance. The SOR alleged ten \nfinancial concerns, including delinquent consumer debt and an unpaid Federal tax debt for tax year \n2016. The Judge found against Applicant on seven of the consumer debts, which totaled \napproximately $107,000, and the $33,000 delinquent tax debt. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOn appeal, Applicant first asserts that he requested and was denied a copy of his complete \nfile that would be presented to the Appeal Board for review on the basis that he had already \nreceived all such documents, which he avers is not true. He points specifically to Hearing Exhibit \n(HE) I as an example of a document he does not have; however, HE I is an email chain with the \nlatest response sent from Applicant to the Judge and the Government on September 17, 2023, \nregarding his post-hearing submission, the status of several of his debts, and his case generally. \nBecause Applicant drafted and sent this document, any argument that he never received it is \nwithout merit. The case file also includes: the SOR issued to Applicant and dated October 26, \n2022; Applicant\u2019s November 15 and 28, 2022, SOR responses; Notice of Hearing and Prehearing \nGuidance issued to both Applicant and the Government on July 21, 2023; Case Management Order \nissued to both Applicant and the Government on August 8, 2023; Government Exhibits (GE) 1 \nthrough 6, which were provided to Applicant by letter dated December 30, 2022; Applicant \nExhibits (AE) A through C, which he offered into evidence during his security clearance hearing; \nand AE D through G, which Applicant offered into evidence after the hearing by email dated \nSeptember 15, 2023. The record reflects that Applicant either received or himself provided all \ndocuments contained in his case file, thereby relieving any concern that he did not receive any \ndocument in the file. \nApplicant also challenges several of the Judge\u2019s factual findings. For example, he contends \nthat he did not submit a security clearance application on December 15, 2020; however, the \nevidence reflects that Applicant electronically certified an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing, also known as a security clearance application, on the date identified. \nSee GE 1 at 54. Other of the Judge\u2019s findings, such as that Applicant is 52 years old when he is \nactually 53 or that he earned his bachelor\u2019s degree in May 2020 when it was actually in May 2010, \nwere erroneous; however, viewed in light of the record as a whole, such errors are harmless \nbecause they did not likely affect the outcome of the case. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 10-01846 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Sep. 13, 2011). \nNext, Applicant takes issue with the number of questions asked by the Judge and \nGovernment, noting that, \u201cother than the administrative procedural questions I was very surprised \nthat [the Judge] did not ask more than 2 questions about my information in this case\u201d and that \nneither the Judge nor the Government \u201casked any questions about the divorce/adoption process \nthat I and my current wife went through of which delayed me from further paying down any more \ndebts.\u201d Appeal Brief at 1, 2. In DOHA proceedings, once the Government has met its burden of \nproving controverted facts, the burden shifts to the applicant to present evidence rebutting or \ndemonstrating extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances sufficient to overcome the \nconcerns raised by the SOR. Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.14, E3.1.15. It is neither the Judge\u2019s nor the \nGovernment\u2019s duty to seek additional mitigating evidence or undertake further investigation of the \nconcerns raised in an SOR. See ISCR Case No. 15-08885 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2017). Rather, \nthe applicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. \nFinally, Applicant contends that several of the debts found adversely were actually paid, \nas documented by his credit report. The debt alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.h, however, continues to report as \noutstanding and charged off. See AE B at 24. On the other hand, Applicant\u2019s argument as it pertains \nto the debts alleged at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d has some merit. The Judge found that, although \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nApplicant testified that he paid the debts at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d, his credit reports continue to reflect \nthat the accounts are unresolved. Decision at 3. Applicant is correct that, contrary to the Judge\u2019s \nadverse findings, his most recent credit report reflects that the collection account at SOR \u00b6 1.c \nappears to have been paid in December 2022. See AE B at 110-112.1 Similarly, the charged off \ndebt at SOR \u00b6 1.d appears to have been paid in November 2022. Id. at 13-15. That being said, the \nerrors concerning two debts totaling less than $2,000 were harmless considering the magnitude of \nApplicant\u2019s remaining financial delinquencies that totaled over $138,000.2 \nThe balance of Applicant\u2019s appeal, including his argument that the Judge failed to give \nadequate weight to the mitigating factors and Whole-Person Concept, amounts to a disagreement \nwith the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, which is not sufficient to demonstrate that the Judge \nweighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary \nto law. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007). Applicant has not rebutted \nthe presumption that the Judge considered all the evidence in the record, nor has he established \nthat the Judge\u2019s conclusions were arbitrary and capricious. \nApplicant has not established that the Judge committed harmful error. Our review of the \nrecord reflects that the Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory \nexplanation for the decision, which is sustainable on this record. \u201cThe general standard is that a \nclearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d \nDepartment of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel \nbeing considered for national security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nAG \u00b6 2(b). \n1 While the Judge erred in this specific finding, that error appears to have resulted from Applicant\u2019s credit report \nshowing that he continues to owe another, unalleged debt to the same creditor that has been placed for collection for \n$984. Id. at 107-109. \n2 In addition to the three debts addressed, above, Applicant also argues that those alleged at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.f have \nbeen paid. The Judge found favorably on these two debts, and therefore Applicant\u2019s argument regarding them is moot. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOrder \nThe decision is AFFIRMED. \nSigned: Moira Modzelewski \nMoira Modzelewski \nAdministrative Judge \nChair, Appeal Board \nSigned: Gregg A.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nRyan C. Nerney, Esq. \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nSeptember 9, 2022, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for \nthat decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). Applicant \nrequested a decision on the written record. Department Counsel provided a copy of the file of \nrelevant material (FORM) to Applicant by letter of October 18, 2022, and Applicant submitted a \nresponse. On December 13, 2022, after consideration of the record, Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Paul J. Mason denied Applicant\u2019s request for a \nsecurity clearance. Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge failed to consider all the \nevidence and whether he failed to apply the mitigating conditions properly, rendering his adverse \ndecision arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. Consistent with the following, we affirm. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis \nApplicant is a high school graduate in her mid-thirties. Single with a teen-aged son, \nApplicant has worked for her current employer since April 2019. The SOR alleges six delinquent \ncommercial accounts that total about $49,000. Applicant admitted the debts and explained that \nthe accounts became delinquent during her two periods of unemployment, from October 2014 to \nDecember 2015 and from September 2017 to March 2019. During those timeframes, Applicant \nused credit cards and loans to pay for basic needs for herself and her son.  Applicant has not made \nany agreements to address the past-due accounts because her current income is insufficient, but \nshe intends to hire a debt consolidation service to establish payment plans with the creditors.  \nIn her FORM response, Applicant represented that she had paid over $46,000 to satisfy \nfour medical accounts, a car loan, and a credit card account, but submitted no evidence to \ncorroborate her claim.  She currently helps her parents financially.  \nNo mitigating condition fully applies, given the lack of financial counseling, evidence of a \nbudget, participation in a debt consolidation service, or any good faith effort to repay her creditors. \nApplicant\u2019s unemployment from October 2014 to December 2015, and from September \n2017 to March 2019, was largely beyond her control. The loss of her income had an adverse impact \non her bill-paying ability. However, for the mitigating condition to be fully applicable, an applicant \nmust provide credible documented evidence that she acted responsibly under the circumstances. \nApplicant has been steadily employed since April 2019, but has done nothing to address her \ndelinquent debt. This three-year period of inaction clearly shows that she did not act reasonably \nand responsibly under the circumstances. [Decision at 5.] \nDiscussion \nIn his appeal brief, Counsel for Applicant does not challenge any of the Judge\u2019s specific \nfindings of fact. Rather, he contends that the Judge failed to adhere to Executive Order 10865 and \nthe Directive by not considering all of the record evidence and by not properly applying the \nmitigating conditions and whole-person concept. Essentially, Counsel argues that the Judge did \nnot give appropriate weight to the following mitigating facts: that Applicant\u2019s financial problems \nwere caused by conditions beyond her control, that she acted reasonably and responsibly in \nprioritizing the needs her young son, and that \u201cshe is currently financially stable.\u201d Appeal Brief \nat 11. However, our review of the Judge\u2019s decision confirms that he considered all these issues. \nIn particular, the Judge highlighted that\u2014in the time since Applicant achieved a state of greater \nfinancial stability\u2014she has failed to address any of her alleged debts. \nNone of Counsel\u2019s arguments are sufficient to rebut the presumption that the Judge \nconsidered all of the evidence in the record, nor are they enough to show that the Judge weighed \nthe evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. See, e.g., ISCR Case \nNo. 19-01400 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 3, 2020). We give due consideration to the Hearing Office cases \nthat Applicant\u2019s Counsel has cited, but they are neither binding precedent on the Board nor \nsufficient to undermine the Judge\u2019s decision. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-02488 at 4 (App. Bd. \nAug. 30, 2018). Moreover, the cited cases are easily distinguishable on their face.

On \nNovember 7, 2022, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for \nthat decision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement and Substance \nMisuse) of the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) of Security Executive Agent \nDirective 4 (effective June 8, 2017) (SEAD 4) and DoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as \namended) (Directive). On July 26, 2023, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals Administrative \nJudge Mark Harvey denied Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility. Applicant appealed pursuant \nto Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant used marijuana and THC-enhanced gummies from about \nAugust 1999 until about July 2021, including after being granted access to classified information \nin September 2012. The Judge found in favor of Applicant with respect to her use after being \ngranted access to classified information, but against her on the general marijuana use that occurred \nfrom 1999 to 2021. \nOn appeal, Applicant argues that the Judge failed to properly apply the Guideline H \nmitigating conditions, whole-person analysis, and Security Executive Agent Clarifying Guidance \nConcerning Marijuana for Agencies Conducting Adjudications of Persons Proposed for Eligibility \nfor Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (Dec. 21, 2021) \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n(SecEA Clarifying Guidance), rendering his adverse decision arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to \nlaw. Consistent with the following, we affirm. \nJudge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis \nApplicant is in her mid-40s. She has been married for 17 years and has one minor child. \nShe holds bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees. Applicant has been employed as a DoD contractor \nsince 2001with two consecutive employers. \nApplicant used marijuana while in college in 1999 but stopped when she was hired as a \nDoD contractor in 2001. In 2012, Applicant was granted a security clearance; however, soon \nthereafter she was transferred to a different location and no longer required access to classified \ninformation. Applicant subsequently resumed her marijuana use, using the drug several times \nbetween 2012 and July 2021. In July 2021, she stopped using marijuana because she was looking \nfor new employment, her daughter was getting older, and she had made certain lifestyle changes. \nApplicant stopped associating with individuals with whom she previously used marijuana, with \nthe exception of her husband, who continues to use the drug outside of Applicant\u2019s presence and \ntheir home. \nApplicant disclosed the foregoing marijuana use during her 2022 clearance reinvestigation, \napproximating that she used the drug ten times or less in the preceding seven years. She understood \nthat she was not permitted to use marijuana while holding a security clearance, but she was not \nsure if her employment qualified as sensitive because \u201cit depends on how the term \u2018sensitive\u2019 is \ndefined.\u201d Decision at 3. During her investigation and hearing, she expressed regret for her \nmarijuana use and submitted a signed statement of intent against such use in the future. \nThe Judge found that Applicant\u2019s \u201cdecision to repeatedly possess and use marijuana after \nbeing granted a security clearance is an indication that she may lack the qualities expected of those \nwith access to national secrets.\u201d Id. at 7. Unable to find any of the mitigating conditions fully \napplicable to Applicant\u2019s marijuana use from 1999 to July 2021, the Judge concluded that \u201c[m]ore \ntime without marijuana use is necessary to establish [Applicant\u2019s] future abstinence from \nmarijuana possession and use.\u201d Id. \nDiscussion \nOn appeal, Applicant first argues that the evidence failed to \u201cestablish a nexus between \n[her very limited recreational marijuana use] and Applicant\u2019s loyalty, honesty, integrity, reliability \nor trustworthiness.\u201d Appeal Brief at 3. Contrary to Applicant\u2019s argument in this regard, the \nDirective presumes there is a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of \nthe Guidelines and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See, e.g., DISCR OSD Case No. 92\u20131106, \n1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993). \nThe remainder of Applicant\u2019s arguments are, generally, that the Judge erroneously \noverlooked certain facts that she believes \u201cindisputably show [her] to be a person of loyalty, \nhonesty, discretion, sound judgment, reliability and the ability to protect classified information.\u201d \nAppeal Brief at 14. As discussed further, below, these arguments are unpersuasive. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMarijuana Use While Holding a Security Clearance \nApplicant argues that the Judge\u2019s decision is contrary to the SecEA Clarifying Guidance \nbecause the decision \u201cmade Applicant\u2019s very limited recreational marijuana use, and primarily a \nsingle use in July 2021, the determining factor in denying the security clearance.\u201d Appeal Brief at \n6. Marijuana use, possession, production, and distribution remain prohibited under Federal law; \nhowever, the referenced memorandum was issued \u201cto provide clarifying guidance to authorized \nadjudicative agencies relating to an individual\u2019s involvement with marijuana, particularly in \nresponse to the increase in the number of state and local governments legalizing or decriminalizing \nuses of marijuana.\u201d SecEA Clarifying Guidance at 1. The Guidance instructs, among other things, \nthat \u201cprior recreational marijuana use by an individual may be relevant to adjudications but not \ndeterminative,\u201d and reiterates the requirement that agencies utilize the Whole-Person Concept \u201cto \ncarefully weigh a number of variables in an individual\u2019s life to determine whether that individual\u2019s \nbehavior raises a security concern, if at all, and whether that concern has been mitigated such that \nthe individual may now receive a favorable adjudicative determination.\u201d Id. at 2. Applicant relies \non this guidance to argue that the Judge improperly focused on the recency of her marijuana use \nin making his adverse decision, and thereby failed to properly weigh that use against mitigating \nand whole-person factors. Appeal Brief at 7-9. \nApplicant\u2019s argument focuses entirely on her position that her marijuana use was relatively \nlimited and last occurred almost two years prior to the hearing. By doing so, her argument also \noverlooks not only that she used a drug that remains illegal under Federal law, but that she did so \nwhile holding a security clearance. The security significance of such conduct is well-settled. \nIndeed, the memorandum upon which Applicant relies acknowledges that significance by \nreferencing the \u201clong-standing federal law and policy prohibiting illegal drug use while occupying \na sensitive position or holding a security clearance\u201d as a basis to warn prospective national security \nworkforce employees against future marijuana use. SecEA Clarifying Guidance at 2. Moreover, \nthe Appeal Board has \u201clong held that applicants who use marijuana after having been placed on \nnotice of the security significance of such conduct may be lacking in the judgment and reliability \nexpected of those with access to classified information.\u201d ISCR Case No. 20-01772 at 3 (App. Bd. \nSep. 14, 2021). See also ISCR Case No. 21-02534 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 13, 2023) (\u201c[A]fter applying \nfor a security clearance and being adequately placed on notice that such conduct was inconsistent \nwith holding a security clearance, an applicant who continues to use marijuana demonstrates a \ndisregard for security clearance eligibility standards, and such behavior raises substantial questions \nabout the applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations.\u201d). \nApplicant acknowledged both her marijuana use while holding a security clearance and her \nunderstanding that marijuana use while holding a security clearance is prohibited. See Government \nExhibit (GE) 1 at 28-29; GE 2 at 6. Such use was a relevant factor that the Judge could, and did, \nconsider in weighing the evidence. See Decision at 7 (Applicant\u2019s \u201cdecision to repeatedly possess \nand use marijuana after being granted a security clearance is an indication that she may lack the \nqualities expected of those with access to national secrets.\u201d) (emphasis added). Based on our \nreview of the record and decision, the Judge\u2019s adverse ruling regarding Applicant\u2019s marijuana use \nis sustainable. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMarijuana Use While Holding a Sensitive Position \nThe Judge found the evidence did not establish disqualification under AG \u00b6 25(f) because \nApplicant \u201cdid not actually have access to classified information, and there is insufficient evidence \nthat she held a \u2018sensitive position.\u2019\u201d Decision at 5. AG \u00b6 25(f) provides disqualification for \u201cany \nillegal drug use while granted access to classified information or holding a sensitive position.\u201d \nRegarding the condition\u2019s first element, access to classified information requires not only \neligibility (i.e., a security clearance), but also a signed nondisclosure agreement and a \u201cneed to \nknow.\u201d See ISCR Case No. 20-03111 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, 2022) (citing Executive Order 13526 \n(Dec. 29, 2009), at \u00a7 4.1). The Judge held that the record, which was devoid of evidence of the \nlatter two requirements, failed to establish that Applicant had access to classified information at \nthe time of her marijuana use. The Judge\u2019s holding regarding the access element of AG \u00b6 25(f) \nwas reasonable. \nTurning to the condition\u2019s second element, based on Applicant\u2019s disclosure of using \nmarijuana while holding a security clearance, the Government could have alleged, \u201cYou used \nmarijuana while holding a sensitive position, i.e., one in which you held a security clearance\u201d to \nattempt to establish AG \u00b6 25(f). For purposes of national security eligibility determinations, the \nDirective defines \u201csensitive position\u201d as: \nAny position within or in support of an agency in which the \noccupant could bring about, by virtue of the nature of the position, \na material adverse effect on the national security regardless of \nwhether the occupant has access to classified information, and \nregardless of whether the occupant is an employee, military service \nmember, or contractor. \nSEAD 4, \u00b6 D.8. This broad language is designed to be inclusive and encompass a wide range of \npositions, including those that require eligibility for access to classified information (i.e., a security \nclearance). See also 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1400. Additionally, the Judge could have amended the SOR to \nconform to the evidence. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.17. For whatever reason, neither did so, and the \nunalleged conduct could not be analyzed under AG \u00b6 25(f). \nThat being said, it is well-established that a judge may properly consider unalleged conduct \nfor other purposes, such as evaluating an applicant\u2019s evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or \nchanged circumstances, and in applying the whole-person concept. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15\u00ad\n07369 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 16, 2017). To that end, the Judge was permitted to consider Applicant\u2019s \nmarijuana use while possessing a security clearance (i.e., holding a sensitive position) in assessing \nwhole-person factors, e.g., \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation,\u201d and so forth. AG \n\u00b6 2(d). Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana while holding a security clearance weighs against the \ncontinuation of her clearance eligibility. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nApplication of Mitigating and Whole-Person Factors \nFollowing on her argument regarding the SecEA Clarifying Guidance, Applicant also \ncontends that the Judge \u201comitted material facts and did not meaningfully analyze or explain why \nall of the undisputed mitigation and the whole-person concept evidence did not mitigate drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse security concerns.\u201d Appeal Brief at 6, 12. This argument is \nwithout merit. \nThe decision reflects that, in his mitigation and whole person analysis, the Judge identified \nand weighed the evidence favorable to Applicant, including that she: received multiple promotions \nfrom her first DoD employer; earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2001 and subsequently earned master\u2019s \ndegrees in business administration and information management; received excellent performance \nevaluations, which included \u201cexceeded expectations\u201d in the areas of integrity and trust; has never \nbeen disciplined by her employers since 2001; was supported by a director at her current \nemployment who described Applicant as an exceptional leader who is extremely talented, loyal, \nethical, diligent, and trustworthy; was candid and honest in self-reporting her marijuana \ninvolvement throughout the security clearance process; did not test positive on a recent urinalysis \ntest; and promised not to use marijuana in the future. See Decision at 8, 9. Despite the foregoing, \nthe Judge ultimately concluded that the \u201cevidence against grant of a security clearance is more \npersuasive at this time.\u201d Id. at 8. \nAs previously discussed, an applicant\u2019s use of marijuana while holding a security clearance \nremains significant conduct in terms of national security eligibility, which a judge may consider \nin reaching an eligibility determination. Applicant\u2019s argument regarding the Judge\u2019s application \nof mitigating and whole-person factors amounts to a disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of \nthe evidence, which is not sufficient to demonstrate that the Judge weighed the evidence or reached \nconclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007). \nFinally, Applicant\u2019s brief relies heavily on hearing-level decisions in unrelated Guideline \nH cases to argue that the Judge erred in his analysis of this case. Hearing-level decisions are not \nbinding precedent on the Appeal Board, and her reliance on those decisions is misplaced. How \nparticular fact scenarios were decided at the hearing level in other cases is generally not a relevant \nconsideration in our review of a case. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-02593 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 18, \n2021). On appeal, Hearing Office decisions may be useful to highlight a novel legal principle; but \nonly in rare situations \u2013 such as separate cases involving spouses, cohabitants, or partners in which \ndrug use allegations are the same \u2013 would the adjudication outcome in another case have any \nmeaningful relevance in our review of a case. The decisions that Applicant cites have no direct \nrelationship or unique link to her case that would make them relevant here. Moreover, the most \nrecent Hearing Office decision cited by Applicant was reversed by the Board. See ISCR Case No. \n22-00392 (Apr. 20, 2023), rev\u2019d (App. Bd. Jun. 1, 2023). \nApplicant has not established that the Judge committed harmful error. The Judge examined \nthe relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision. The decision is \nsustainable on this record. \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \n\u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v.

The Judge found against Applicant on each of \nthe SOR allegations. For reason stated below, we remand the Judge\u2019s decision for corrective \naction.  \nIn his appeal brief, Applicant provides new evidence, including a DoE document and \ndocuments concerning other debts.

    "summary": "findings of fact by stating that he did not recall interviews with an investigator in March 2020 or in November 2021. Applicant is correct that there is no document in the Government\u2019s File of Relevant Material (FORM) showing that Applicant was interviewed in March 2020. However, the summary of his interview with an investigator in November 2021 is included in FORM, Item 3. The typographical error referencing a March 2020 interview instead of the actual November 2021 interview is harmless because it did not likely affect the outcome of the decision. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 18-02581 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 14, 2020). Applicant also asserts the Judge erred in finding that he has no children, noting he has a stepson, and in failing to find that he held a clearance since 1996. We find no merit in these latter assertions of error because Applicant failed to list that he had a stepchild in his security clearance application and only listed the granting of his last clearance in 2011.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nPro se \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nDecember 13, 2022, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for \nthat decision\u2015security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) in Appendix A of Security Executive Agent \nDirective 4 (effective June 8, 2017) and DoD Directive 5220.6 (January 2, 1992, as amended) \n(Directive). Applicant requested a decision on the written record. On July 28, 2023, after \nconsidering the record, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals Administrative Judge Pamela C. \nBenson denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. Applicant appealed pursuant to \nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. For reasons stated below, we affirm the Judge\u2019s decision. \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant had four delinquent debts totaling over $20,000. In \nresponding to the SOR, Applicant admitted each of the allegations. The Judge summarized the \ncase as follows: \nApplicant did not begin to pay on two of his delinquent debts until after the SOR \nwas issued.  He did not make any payments on the other two delinquent debts.  He \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndid not take responsible action to address his financial obligations until his security \nclearance was in peril, and he still has unresolved delinquent debt. Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is denied.  [Decision at 1.] \nApplicant\u2019s appeal brief contains assertions and documents that were not presented to the \nJudge for consideration. In fact, some of those documents post-date the Judge\u2019s decision. We are \nprohibited from considering that new evidence.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29 (\u201cNo new evidence shall \nbe received or considered by the Appeal Board.\u201d). \nApplicant is apparently challenging the Judge\u2019s findings of fact by stating that he did not \nrecall interviews with an investigator in March 2020 or in November 2021. Applicant is correct \nthat there is no document in the Government\u2019s File of Relevant Material (FORM) showing that \nApplicant was interviewed in March 2020. However, the summary of his interview with an \ninvestigator in November 2021 is included in FORM, Item 3. The typographical error referencing \na March 2020 interview instead of the actual November 2021 interview is harmless because it did \nnot likely affect the outcome of the decision. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 18-02581 at 3 (App. Bd. \nJan. 14, 2020). Applicant also asserts the Judge erred in finding that he has no children, noting he \nhas a stepson, and in failing to find that he held a clearance since 1996. We find no merit in these \nlatter assertions of error because Applicant failed to list that he had a stepchild in his security \nclearance application and only listed the granting of his last clearance in 2011. FORM, Item 2 at \n21 and 31-32. The Judge\u2019s findings that Applicant had no children and has held a clearance since \n2011 were supported by the evidence that was presented to her. \nApplicant further contends the Judge failed to consider some evidence that he submitted in \nan email in July 2023. We note that Applicant\u2019s FORM Response contains several documents \nshowing that he was making payments, including as late as July 2023, on two of the alleged debts. \nThe Judge made findings that Applicant was making payments on these debts and that they are \nbeing resolved. None of Applicant\u2019s arguments are enough to rebut the presumption that the Judge \nconsidered all of the record evidence or to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner \nthat was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 22-02225 at 2 (App. \nBd. Jul. 27, 2023). \nApplicant failed to establish that the Judge committed any harmful error or that he warrants \nany remedial action. The Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory \nexplanation for the decision. The decision is sustainable on the record. \u201cThe general standard is \nthat a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national \nsecurity.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v.

Mendez, Esq., Deputy Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nPro se \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nOctober 24, 2022, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for \nthat decision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct), Guideline E \n(Personal Conduct), Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption), and Guideline H (Drug Involvement \nand Substance Misuse) of the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) in Appendix A of \nSecurity Executive Agent Directive 4 (effective June 8, 2017) and Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). Applicant requested a hearing. On \nSeptember 26, 2023, after the hearing, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nAdministrative Judge Robert E. Coacher denied Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility. \nApplicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nUnder Guideline J, the SOR alleged Applicant was charged in January 2021 with illegal \ndischarge of a firearm, intoxication, and carrying a dangerous weapon under the influence of \nalcohol.

He was sentenced to pay fines and fees and to serve a term of 12 \nmonths\u2019 probation while abstaining from alcohol use. The SOR also alleged Applicant was \ncharged with wrongful use or possession of a controlled substance while on active duty and was \nadministratively separated with a general discharge under honorable conditions in May 2019. \nUnder Guideline G, the SOR cross-alleged the 2021 conviction and alleged that he was required \nto attend an alcohol education class. Under Guideline H, the SOR cross-alleged the military-related \ncontrolled substance charge and alleged Applicant used steroids from 2016 to 2017 while granted \naccess to classified information. Applicant admitted these allegations, with explanations. Finally, \nunder Guideline E, the 2021 conviction and 2019 military charge were cross-alleged, along with \nApplicant\u2019s alleged use of steroids. \nThe Judge found in favor of Applicant on the allegations under Guidelines G and H, and \nagainst him on the allegations under Guidelines J and E. On appeal, Applicant generally argues \nthe Judge failed to properly consider all available evidence, rendering his adverse decision \narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law, and submits new evidence. Consistent with the following, \nwe affirm. \nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact \nApplicant is in his mid-twenties. He served in the military from 2015 to 2019 when he was \nadministratively separated with a general discharge. He has been employed by a defense contractor \nsince 2020. Applicant used steroids while on active duty on the advice of other service members, \nin part because he was concerned about meeting his service\u2019s physical standards. As a result, he \nwas administratively discharged from the military. When interviewed by military investigators \nabout his steroid use, Applicant admitted to drinking about 10 beers at a housewarming party. As \na result, he attended alcohol-education classes as ordered by his command. \nIn 2021, Applicant was arrested when he and a friend attended a party and fired a small \ncaliber rifle into the air from a nearby field while celebrating the new year. A neighbor called \npolice, and Applicant was cited for gun and alcohol violations to which he later entered a plea \nagreement. \nThe Judge found that Applicant\u2019s steroid abuse in 2018 and his 2021 arrest showed his \n\u201cbad judgment.\u201d Applicant admitted that he let others, whom he considered mentors, convince him \nto use steroids, and in 2021 he and a friend engaged in celebratory gunfire in a residential area \nwhile consuming alcohol. The Judge held that both incidents displayed poor judgment and that, \ndespite completing probation, it was too soon to determine that Applicant had been successfully \nrehabilitated and or that similar crimes were not likely to recur in the future. The Judge also found \nthat Applicant\u2019s 2018 discharge from the military should have sent a powerful message that he \nneeded to use better judgment but it was ignored when he was arrested in 2021. He held that \nApplicant\u2019s conduct under Guidelines J and E reflects questionable judgment and an unwillingness \nto comply with rules and regulations.

First, he takes issue with some of \nthe findings of fact and the Judge\u2019s application of the facts in his analysis. Second, he contends \nthe Judge failed to consider all the evidence in mitigation. Third, he submitted new evidence in \nmitigation. Consequently, Applicant argues, the Judge failed to adhere to the procedures required \nby the Directive and rendered a decision that was arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law. \nApplicant appears to argue that\u2014although his diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder \n(PTSD) and mental health treatment was discussed at the hearing\u2014it was not considered in the \nJudge\u2019s mitigation analysis. He says that his diagnosis and treatment, along with his actions, \n\u201cclearly show that Applicant realized he was not in the correct mental state from his previous \nmilitary career and sought proper treatment as a result to rectify the situation.\u201d Appeal Brief at 2. \nApplicant failed, however, to present his PTSD diagnosis during the evidentiary phase of the \nhearing, and rather he waited until closing arguments to mention it. Tr. at 49. As a result, he was \nthen questioned on his PTSD diagnosis and treatment and had an opportunity to explain its \nrelevance to the SOR allegations or in mitigation. He testified that he never sought treatment while \non active duty but was diagnosed by the Veterans Administration with PTSD with anxiety, and \ndepression as a secondary condition. Tr. at 50-52. There is a rebuttable presumption that the Judge \nconsidered all the record evidence unless he specifically states otherwise. Moreover, the Judge is \nnot required to cite or discuss every piece of record evidence. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 \nat 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007). \nApplicant also raises various other points that he argues should have been given greater \nweight in the Judge\u2019s analysis. First, he argues that Guideline I (Psychological Conditions) \nconcerns, criminal conduct, and alcohol use concerns were mitigated by his mental health \ntreatment, rehabilitation, and passage of time without recurrence. Next, he argues that he was \npressured or coerced into using steroids. Finally, he said his alcohol abuse was related to PTSD, \nbut he received treatment without relapse, controls his alcohol consumption, and maintains regular \nemployment. None of Applicant\u2019s arguments are enough to rebut the presumption that the Judge \nconsidered all of the record evidence or to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner \nthat was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. Guideline I was never alleged in the SOR, and \nthe Judge found the drug and alcohol allegations were mitigated and in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nThe remaining issues raised on appeal appear to argue for an alternative weighing of the \nevidence in Applicant\u2019s favor. The record shows that the Judge complied with the requirements of \nthe Directive in his whole-person analysis by considering all relevant evidence in reaching his \ndecision. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-01400 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 3, 2020). As for new evidence \nthat he appended to his appeal, the Appeal Board is prohibited from considering new evidence on \nappeal. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29. Additionally, to the extent that Applicant\u2019s arguments amount to a \ndisagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, his arguments are insufficient to \ndemonstrate that the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is \narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3. The favorable \nevidence cited by Applicant is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncapricious, or contrary to law.

On \nJanuary 17, 2023, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for \nthat decision\u2015security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) in Appendix A of Security Executive Agent \nDirective 4 (effective Jun. 8, 2017) and DoD Directive 5220.6 (January 2, 1992, as amended) \n(Directive). Applicant requested a hearing. On September 1, 2023, after the record closed, \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Richard A. Cefola denied \nApplicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility. Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 \nand E3.1.30. \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant had six delinquent debts. In responding to the SOR, \nApplicant admitted all but two allegations in which he denied because the debts were charged off. \nThe Judge found against Applicant on all of the allegations. In summarizing the decision, the \nJudge stated, \u201cAlthough Applicant can attribute his current financial difficulties to periods of \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nunemployment, his financial problems are ongoing. Despite having the financial wherewithal to \naddress them, Applicant has chosen not to do so. He has not demonstrated that future financial \nproblems are unlikely.\u201d Decision at 5. \nApplicant\u2019s appeal brief does not assert that the Judge committed any harmful error, nor \ndoes he dispute the Judge\u2019s findings or conclusions. Rather, it merely argues why his demonstrated \nresponsibility, financial improvements, and lack of other disqualifying factors support \nreconsideration of his clearance eligibility. Appeal Brief at 1. Applicant\u2019s argument amounts to a \ndisagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, which is not sufficient to demonstrate \nthat he weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or \ncontrary to law. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007). The favorable \nevidence cited by Applicant is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, \ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Id. \nThe Appeal Board does not review cases de novo.  The Board\u2019s authority to review a case \nis limited to cases in which the appealing party has alleged the Judge committed harmful error. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.32. Because Applicant has not alleged such a harmful error, the decision of the \nJudge denying Applicant security clearance eligibility is sustainable. \nOrder \nThe decision is AFFIRMED. \nSigned: James F.

On \nNovember 18, 2022, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for \nthat decision\u2015security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and \nGuideline G (Alcohol Consumption) of the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) in \nAppendix A of Security Executive Agent Directive 4 (effective June 8, 2017) and DoD Directive \n5220.6 (January 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). Applicant requested a decision on the written \nrecord. In the File of Relevant Material (FORM), the Government withdrew the sole Guideline G \nallegation. On July 24, 2023, after considering the record, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \nAdministrative Judge Charles C. Hale denied Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility. Applicant \nappealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. For reasons stated below, we affirm the \nJudge\u2019s decision. \nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleged that Applicant had six delinquent debts totaling about \n$14,400 and that he received a Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge in 2016. In responding to the SOR, \nApplicant admitted with comments four of the debt allegations and the bankruptcy discharge \nallegation. The Judge found in favor of Applicant on two of the alleged debts and against him on \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe other Guideline F allegations. The Judge concluded that, while Applicant\u2019s financial \ndelinquencies were attributable to circumstances beyond his control, he did not provide sufficient \nevidence to show that he acted responsibly to resolve them.  \nOn appeal, Applicant contends the Judge erred in failing to take \u201ceverything\u201d into \nconsideration. Appeal Brief at 1. He highlights that he made a move across the country, and his \ntime and expenses were going towards pressing matters, such as an emergency custody hearing \nthat arose because his ex-wife was using drugs around his sons. Id. He noted \u201cother things got \nlost during the process\u201d and, although \u201cthey should not have gotten to that point,\u201d his sons were \nhis priority. Id. He contends that his ex-wife opened accounts in his name without his knowledge \nand argues that he has since taken care of all but one of the alleged debts, noting the remaining \ndebt is under a payment plan and has been removed from a collection status. \nNone of Applicant\u2019s arguments are enough to rebut the presumption that the Judge \nconsidered all of the record evidence or to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner \nthat was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 21-01169 at 5 (App. \nBd. May 13, 2022). In the decision, the Judge found that Applicant attributed his debts to his \nsecond divorce and addressed the status of each alleged debt. The Judge noted that one alleged \ndebt was disputed as fraudulent, three were either resolved or a payment plan was initiated after \nthe SOR was issued, and another debt was no longer listed on his credit report. In concluding that \nthe alleged security concerns were not mitigated, the Judge cited ISCR Case No. 15-03208 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Mar. 7, 2017) (an applicant who waits until his clearance is in jeopardy before resolving \ndebts may be lacking in the judgment expected of those granted security clearance eligibility) and \nISCR Case No. 14-03612 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 25, 2015) (mere evidence that debts no longer appear \non a credit report is not reason to believe that they have been paid or resolved in a responsible \nmanner). \nApplicant failed to establish that the Judge committed any harmful error. The Judge \nexamined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision. The \ndecision is sustainable on the record. \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted \nonly when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nSamir Nakhleh, Esq. \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nDecember 12, 2022, DoD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis of \nthat decision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) in Appendix A of Security Executive Agent \nDirective 4 (effective June 8, 2017) and DoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) \n(Directive). On June 9, 2023, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals Administrative Judge \nDarlene Lokey Anderson denied Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility. Applicant appealed \npursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nApplicant, in his early 40s, is employed as a defense contractor and has held a security \nclearance since 2007. In his July 2021 security clearance application, Applicant disclosed that he \nhad failed to file his Federal income tax returns since 2014, citing a lack of knowledge on how to \nfile the returns properly and asserting that he had contacted a tax attorney to help him address the \noutstanding returns. See File of Relevant Material (FORM) Item 3 at 34-36. One year later, in July \n2022, Applicant responded to Government interrogatories and disclosed that he had still not filed \nhis delinquent returns, now including those for tax years 2012 and 2013, and again represented \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthat he was \u201ccontacting multiple tax agencies who may be able to help\u201d him file correctly. FORM \nItem 4 at 3-20. Based on the foregoing, the SOR alleged that Applicant failed to timely file his \nFederal income tax returns for tax years 2012 through 2020. As of his December 2022 answer to \nthe SOR, Applicant asserted, without elaborating, that returns for all of the years alleged were in \nthe process of being filed. \nThe Judge found that Applicant was aware of the requirement to timely file his tax returns \nand there was no documentation corroborating that he had taken any steps to ensure the alleged \nreturns are being filed or that Applicant\u2019s returns will be timely filed going forward. Decision at \n5. The Judge ruled adversely on the SOR allegation and concluded that Applicant\u2019s \u201cinaction for \nso long reflects a pattern of unreliability, untrustworthiness, and poor judgment,\u201d and he therefore \n\u201cdoes not meet the requirements to access classified information.\u201d Id. \nOn appeal, Counsel for Applicant contends that the Judge failed to properly consider all \navailable evidence and failed to properly apply the mitigating conditions and whole-person \nanalysis. As discussed more fully below, Counsel\u2019s arguments are frivolous. \nFor example, Counsel argues that the Judge placed too much weight on the fact that \nApplicant\u2019s returns were unfiled and \u201cchose to disregard that [Applicant\u2019s] taxes would not lead \nto a debt\u201d and that his Transcripts show that he does \u201cnot have a current outstanding debt.\u201d Appeal \nBrief at 9. This argument fails for multiple reasons. First, it is well-settled that an individual who \nis unwilling to fulfill his legal obligations to the Federal Government \u2013 such as timely filing income \ntax returns \u2013 does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of \npersons granted access to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 98-0810, 2000 WL \n1247732 at *4 (App. Bd. Jun. 8, 2000) (\u201cIt is untenable for an applicant to refuse to accept his or \nher legal obligation to comply with the federal tax laws and then insist that the federal government \nmust grant him or her the privilege of handling classified information.\u201d). The Directive cites failure \nto file tax returns as a disqualifying condition in and of itself, irrespective of whether the \nunderlying taxes have actually been paid, such as through withholding. Indeed, an applicant\u2019s legal \nobligation to timely file income tax returns is independent from whether or not he owes additional \ntaxes. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 94-0964, 1996 WL 648762 at *5 (App. Bd. Jul. 3, 1996). Even if \nthe record in this case supported that Applicant owed no debt for the deficient tax years alleged in \nthe SOR (it does not), the lack of any tax balance does not nullify the concern raised by his knowing \nand repeated failure to abide by his tax filing obligation for almost a decade. \nSecond and to that end, Counsel\u2019s argument that Applicant has no outstanding tax debt and \nthat filing his delinquent returns will not result in any balance being assessed is not persuasive. \nWhile Applicant\u2019s Transcripts do reflect that no balances are owed for the years in question, they \nalso reflect that no returns, including IRS substitute tax returns, have been filed for those years. \nSee FORM Item 4 at 4-20. Without the returns being filed, thereby providing the underlying data \nwith which to calculate Applicant\u2019s tax obligations, the $0 account balance reported in each \ntranscript is not sufficient to establish that Applicant owes no Federal tax debt for those years. \nFinally, Counsel argues that the Judge \u201cfailed to make a rational finding\u201d regarding AG \u00b6 \n20(d), which permits mitigation if \u201cthe individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d Appeal Brief at 8.

See FORM Item 4 at 14. Because there are no delinquent debts \nalleged in the SOR, it is unclear why Counsel elected to focus his challenge on AG \u00b6 20(d) instead \nof AG \u00b6 20(g), which specifically applies to tax filing concerns and allows similarly for mitigation \nwhen \u201cthe individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority to file . . . and is \nin compliance with those arrangements.\u201d Regardless, Counsel\u2019s challenge under either mitigating \ncondition fails because there is no evidence that Applicant has made any arrangement to address \nany of his tax deficiencies. \nDespite Counsel\u2019s undue reliance on this line item and blanket statement that \u201cApplicant \nhas no outstanding debt due because [he] has already completed a good-faith arrangement to \nprevent future tax debts via proper tax withholding\u201d (Appeal Brief at 8), the record is devoid of \ninformation regarding the impact of this notice on any tax assessment resulting from Applicant\u2019s \ntax filing deficiency for that tax year or any of the other years alleged in the SOR. \nApplicant has failed to meet his burden of demonstrating error below. The Judge examined \nthe relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision, which is \nsustainable on this record. \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \n\u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v.

Applicant requested a decision on the written record. On July 28, 2023, after \nconsidering the record, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals Administrative Judge Gatha \nManns denied Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility. Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \n\u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. For reasons stated below, we affirm the Judge\u2019s decision. \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant had 12 delinquent debts totaling about $117,000. In \nresponding to the SOR, Applicant admitted 10 of the allegations and denied the remaining two \ntotaling about 19,000. The Judge stated: \n[Applicant] did not provide documentary evidence to support his case, nor did he \nexplain the circumstances that led to his financial problems.

He did not provide information or evidence about his income, \nexpenses, or other financial resources at his disposal. \nNor did he provide \ninformation or evidence he received or is receiving financial counseling, and his \nfinancial problems are not under control. [Decision at 6.] \nThe Judge found in favor of Applicant on two alleged debts totaling about $8,600 and against him \non the other allegations, concluding there was insufficient evidence presented to show that he made \na good-faith effort to pay his debts, that he acted responsibly under the circumstances, or that his \nfinancial problems will be resolved within a reasonable time. \nOn appeal, Applicant does not specifically assert that the Judge committed any harmful \nerror. Rather, he states that he was deeply troubled by the lack of fairness and impartiality in the \nadjudication process, claiming that no effort was made to determine his military discharge status \nand arguing that circumstances beyond his control created his financial problems. He requests that \nhis case be thoroughly reviewed and indicates that he is willing to provide additional \ndocumentation, including a current credit report and his DD-214 showing a medical retirement \nfrom the military.  These assertions fail to establish the Judge committed any harmful error. \nWe first note that Applicant\u2019s SOR Response contains no documentation showing that he \nwas taking action to resolve the alleged debts. On March 2, 2023, the Government\u2019s File of \nRelevant Material (FORM) was sent to Applicant, which included all of the documentary evidence \nthe Government was submitting to the Judge for consideration. Applicant was provided 30 days \nfrom his receipt of the FORM to submit objections or matters in rebuttal, extenuation, mitigation, \nor explanation. He was informed that the Judge\u2019s decision would be \u201cbased solely on this FORM\u201d \nunless he submitted additional information. FORM at 4. Applicant submitted no response to the \nFORM. If there were additional matters that Applicant wanted the Judge to consider beyond those \ncontained in the FORM, he was responsible for providing that information. Based on our review \nof the record, we find no basis for concluding that Applicant was treated in an unfair manner or \nthat he was denied any due process rights afforded him under the Directive. Finally, we note that \nthe Appeal Board does not review cases de novo, and we are prohibited from receiving or \nconsidering new evidence on appeal.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29. \nThe Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for \nthe decision.

On October 4, 2023, after the record closed, Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals Administrative Judge Benjamin R. Dorsey denied Applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility. Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant had 18 delinquent Federal student loans and a delinquent \ntuition account, all in collections, totaling about $71,000. In responding to the SOR, Applicant \ndenied the allegations. The Judge found against Applicant on all of the allegations. \nThe Judge\u2019s decision notes that Applicant is in his mid-forties and has worked for a \nGovernment contractor, on and off, since December 2018. He was married in 2007 and divorced \nin 2016. He shares custody of his teenaged child. He honorably served in the U.S. military from \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n1999 to 2007 and earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2015. Applicant received Federal student loans \nbeginning in about 2011 to finance his on-line college program. Applicant claimed that his ex-\nspouse submitted a packet of documents that included an application for the loans. He said he did \nnot look closely at the packet and cannot recall details, including the amounts borrowed. He said \nhis ex-wife led him to believe they were borrowing money to pay for Christmas presents and to \nupgrade his gaming personal computer. He acknowledged that when he signed the loan packet, he \nknew he was applying for a student loan and may have authorized the full student loan and tuition \nbalance alleged in the SOR. Decision at 2. \nApplicant suspects his ex-wife opened additional federal student loans in his name without \nhis knowledge or consent, but he did not provide corroborating evidence. He claimed that he first \nbecame aware of the full extent of his student loan and tuition indebtedness in about July 2015 \nwhen he happened to look at his account information online. He and his wife were expecting to \nqualify for Veterans Affairs disability benefits that would eliminate their Federal student debts. \nAfter they divorced in 2016, the previously deferred loans became delinquent, and he was notified \nof late payments. He took no action to address his debts until about February 2020. He did not \ndispute the debts with the Department of Education, loan servicer, or credit reporting agencies, nor \ndid he accuse his ex-wife of fraud or take civil action against her. Decision at 2-3. \nIn February 2020, he contacted the loan servicer and arranged to automatically pay $5 per \nmonth. He made two payments before all Federal student loans were placed into a national \ndeferment status during the COVID-19 pandemic by President Biden. The Judge found that the \nstudent loans were delinquent before the COVID-19 deferment began. As of the date of the \nhearing, Applicant had not contacted DOE or the loan servicer to determine the status of his debts \nor the amount of the expected monthly payments and had not made any payments until after the \nhearing despite the end of the deferment period. Applicant\u2019s 2021 and 2022 credit reports support \nthe debts, but a 2023 credit report lists the loans as \u201cpaid as agreed\u201d and elsewhere as past due. \nApplicant is unaware of why the accounts are listed as \u201cpays as agreed.\u201d The credit report also \nshows Applicant is behind on his mortgage and auto loan and took out a loan for $6,000 in 2022 \nto go on vacation. Decision at 3. \nThe Judge found that Applicant\u2019s failure to address his debs was partially caused by his \nown inaction and partly by a divorce, unemployment, and underemployment. He was in default \nbeginning in 2016 until March 2020 when they were deferred because of the pandemic. Decision \nat 4. Although the loans were no longer considered delinquent as a result of the pandemic \ndeferment, the Judge held that the deferment action does not excuse the previously delinquent \naccounts. Applicant did not dispute the debts or take action to resolve the debts while in default. \nAlthough one portion of his 2023 credit report shows the accounts as no longer delinquent, this \nchange does not reflect a positive resolution of the accounts, and Applicant was unaware that they \nwere no longer listed in collections. Decision at 6-7. \nApplicant\u2019s appeal brief does not assert that the Judge committed any harmful error, nor \ndoes he dispute the Judge\u2019s findings or conclusions. Rather, he merely re-argues his claim that his \nex-wife took out the loans without his knowledge or consent, his work with a collection agent in \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2020 to rehabilitate his debts, his payments since the deferment period ended, his military service, \nand good financial record to support reconsideration of his clearance eligibility. Appeal Brief at 1\u00ad\n2. Applicant admits that he \u201cdid not want to take responsibility for the student loans after I learned \nof the full amount due. I felt as though I had been wronged. In retrospect, I should have made the \npayments that were due \u2013 and I should have taken legal action against my wife.\u201d Id. at 1. \nApplicant\u2019s argument amounts to a disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the \nevidence, which is not sufficient to demonstrate that he weighed the evidence or reached \nconclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007). With regard to past delinquencies, the Judge correctly \ncites to Appeal Board precedence noting that \u201ca security clearance represents an obligation to the \nFederal Government for the protection of national secrets. Accordingly, failure to honor other \nobligations to the Government has a direct bearing on an applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, \nand ability to protect classified information.\u201d Decision at 6 (citing ISCR Case No. 14-03358 at 2 \n(App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2015)). \nWhile Applicant\u2019s student loans were no longer considered delinquent as of March 2020 \nbecause of the COVID-19 deferment, we have upheld a finding that \u201cit does not excuse Applicant\u2019s \npast inactions in the context of security clearance eligibility.\u201d See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 20-01527 \nat 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 7, 2021). As contrasted with our decision in ISCR Case No. 21-01284 (App. \nBd. Nov. 8, 2022), the Government here established that Applicant\u2019s student loans were delinquent \nbefore they were deferred during the pandemic. The length of time a debt is delinquent is a factor \nto consider in assessing the security concerns arising from that debt. See generally ISCR Case No. \n20-01527 at 2; ISCR Case No. 20-03208 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 6, 2021); and ISCR Case No. 20\u00ad\n02219 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 28, 2021) (affirming unfavorable clearance decisions involving student \nloans deferred during the COVID-19 pandemic because those loans were delinquent for significant \nperiods before that deferment became effective). \nWe note that Applicant attended an institution in which the Department of Education has \napproved a Federal student loan forgiveness program due to deception found regarding job \nplacement claims. Eligible borrowers must apply for forgiveness of qualifying loans. See \nwww.ftc.gov/enforcement/refunds/devry-refunds (Feb. 2022). In this case, there was no evidence \npresented to show that Applicant was aware of the program, was a victim of such deceptive \npractices, applied for or was qualified for loan forgiveness. Rather, the evidence shows that the \nstudent loans were used largely for personal expenses and that he displayed irresponsibility in \nother financial matters. Despite the possible availability of the student loan forgiveness program, \nApplicant is responsible for using due diligence to inquire into such programs and act to \nresponsibly address his debts. He did neither in this case. \nThe Appeal Board does not review cases de novo.  The Board\u2019s authority to review a case \nis limited to cases in which the appealing party has alleged the Judge committed harmful error. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.32. Because Applicant has not alleged such a harmful error, the decision of the \nJudge denying Applicant security clearance eligibility is sustainable. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOrder \nThe decision is AFFIRMED. \nSigned: Moira Modzelewski \nMoira Modzelewski \nAdministrative Judge \nChair, Appeal Board \nSigned: Gregg A.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nPro se \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nOctober 31, 2022, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for \nthat decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement and Substance \nMisuse) of the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) in Appendix A of Security \nExecutive Agent Directive 4 (effective Jun. 8, 2017) and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 \n(Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a decision on the written record. On \nMay 22, 2023, after considering the record, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nAdministrative Judge LeRoy F. Foreman denied Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility. \nApplicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant used marijuana with varying frequency from about late \n2016 to about mid-2022 and that he intended to continue to use marijuana in the future. The Judge \nfound against Applicant on both allegations. In his appeal brief, Applicant contends that Judge \ncommitted three analytical errors.  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis \nIn his June 2022 security clearance application (SCA), Applicant disclosed that he used \nmarijuana recreationally from about November 2016 to May 2022 and that he intended to use \nmarijuana in the future, explaining, \u201cI have friends who will be living in states where the drug is \nlegal for recreational use and will possibly use it while visiting.\u201d File of Relevant Material \n(FORM) Item 3 at 36. During his August 2022 background interview, Applicant indicated that he \nused marijuana about once a month with his brother and friends and purchased it from dispensaries \nin adjoining states where it is legal.  In his SOR Response, he said, \u201cI would like to add that as of \nnow I do intend to stop the use of marijuana consumption.\u201d In his response to the FORM, he \nfurther explained, \u201cMy early statement of intention to stop was to never use marijuana again. I \nhave not had any association with marijuana since October 2022 and will not have any association \nagain.\u201d    \nThe Judge concluded that Applicant\u2019s marijuana use was recent, frequent, and did not \nhappen under circumstances making recurrence unlikely and further stated: \nAG \u00b6 26(b) is not fully established. Applicant acknowledged his drug involvement \nin his SCA, and he stated that he last used marijuana in May 2022, shortly after he \nwas hired by . . . his current employer and before he submitted his SCA. In his \nresponse to the FORM, he stated that his last association with marijuana was in \nOctober 2022, after he submitted his SCA. He has not claimed that he has \ndissociated from drug-using associates, including his brother. He has not changed \nor avoided the environment where he used drugs. Although he declared in his \nanswer to the SOR and response to the FORM that he will not use marijuana again, \nhe has not provided the signed statement of intent described in AG \u00b6 26(b)(3). \nApplicant did not disavow his answers to drug-related questions in the SCA until \nhe received the SOR and realized that his marijuana use was an impediment to \nobtaining a clearance. It is not clear from the limited record whether he sincerely \ndecided that obtaining a clearance was more important to him than his recreational \nuse of marijuana, or whether he simply readjusted his statement of intent in an \nattempt to overcome the impact of his admission in the SCA. \n* * * \nThe inconsistency between Applicant\u2019s answers in the SCA and his responses to \nthe SOR and the FORM raises doubt about his true intent. Once a concern arises \nregarding an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information, there is a \nstrong presumption against granting eligibility. Applicant has not overcome that \npresumption.

He argues that he submitted a \u201cstatement of change\u201d in his SOR \nResponse when he stated that \u201cI would like to add that as of now I do intend to stop the use of \nmarijuana consumption.\u201d  Appeal Brief at 1.  This argument is not persuasive. \nAG \u00b6 26(b) provides an individual could mitigate Guideline H security concerns by \n\u201cacknowledge[ing] his or her drug involvement and substance misuse, provid[ing] evidence of \nactions taken to overcome this problem, and [establishing] a pattern of abstinence, including, but \nnot limited to: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or avoiding \nthe environment where drugs were used; and (3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain \nfrom all drug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future illegal drug \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility.\u201d Of note, \nApplicant\u2019s SOR and FORM responses do not contain an acknowledgment that any future illegal \ndrug involvement would be a ground for revoking his national security eligibility.  Consequently, \nthe Judge was accurate when he stated that Applicant \u201chas not provided the signed statement of \nintent described in AG \u00b6 26(b)(3).\u201d Decision at 6. Next and more importantly, a judge is \nresponsible for determining the weight and credibility of the evidence. The Appeal Board gives \ndeference to a Judge\u2019s credibility determinations. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1. As noted by the \nhighlighted phrase in the block-quote above, the Judge considered Applicant assertions in his SOR \nand FORM responses as a statement of intent but did not find those statements convincing. The \nJudge questioned Applicant\u2019s \u201ctrue intent\u201d based on his inconsistent statements and essentially \nconcluded that Applicant\u2019s statements in his SOR and FORM responses were insufficient to \nestablish that he would abstain from marijuana use in the future. Based on our review of the record, \nwe find no reason to disturb this challenged conclusion. Decision at 6. \nApplicant\u2019s remaining arguments essentially advocate for an alternative weighing of the \nevidence. In those arguments, he asserts \u201cthe pattern of continued use is also false\u201d and challenges \nthe Judge\u2019s finding that Applicant had not claimed to dissociate from his brother, a drug-using \nindividual. Appeal Brief at 1. Applicant argues that he does not use or discuss marijuana with his \nbrother and such \u201climited communication [with a sibling] should not be counted as a strike against \nmy ability to hold a clearance.\u201d Id. \nThese remaining arguments establish no error. First, the Judge did not conclude that \nApplicant had a \u201cpattern of continued use\u201d of marijuana. As noted above, he instead essentially \nconcluded that Applicant failed to establish that he would abstain from marijuana use in the future, \nwhich was a reasonable inference drawn from the record evidence. \nRegarding the challenge \ninvolving Applicant\u2019s brother, the Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant \u201chas not claimed that he has \ndisassociated with drug-using individuals, including his brother,\u201d is supported by record evidence. \nThe weight to be given such evidence is within the Judge\u2019s special province. See, e.g., ISCR Case \nNo. 18-00857 at 4 (App. Bd. May 8, 2019). It was reasonable for the Judge to conclude that \nApplicant\u2019s continuing contact with a drug-using individual, no matter the nature of that \nrelationship, could lead to Applicant\u2019s further use of illegal drugs. In general, Applicant\u2019s \ndisagreements with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence are insufficient to establish that the \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nJudge\u2019s analysis or conclusions were arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.

On \nNovember 18, 2022, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for \nthat decision\u2e3asecurity concerns raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement and Substance \nMisuse) of the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) of Security Executive Agent \nDirective 4 (effective June 8, 2017) (SEAD 4) and DoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as \namended) (Directive). On July 27, 2023, after conducting a hearing, Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals Administrative Judge Richard A. Cefola denied Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility. Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. For reasons stated \nbelow, we remand the Judge\u2019s decision. \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant purchased and used various illegal drugs, including \nmarijuana from about 2013 to May 2022, MDMA/Ecstasy from about 2016 to October 2018, LSD \nfrom about 2016 to August 2017, cocaine from about 2017 to April 2018, and hallucinogenic \nmushrooms in about August 2017, and that he used marijuana after completing a security clearance \napplication (SCA) in April 2022. In responding to the SOR, Applicant admitted each of the \nallegations and provided information in support of his request for security clearance eligibility. \nThe Judge found against Applicant on each of the SOR allegations, concluding insufficient time \nhas passed to mitigate the alleged security concerns. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nErrors in Factual Findings \nOn appeal, Applicant, who is 28 years old, correctly points out the Judge made several \nfactual errors in the decision. These errors are related and, when considered together, constitute \nharmful error. \nFirst, the Judge erred in stating that there were no objections to Applicant\u2019s exhibits (AE). \nIn this regard, the Government objected to a portion of AE Q, a psychological evaluation, based \non a sentence in the evaluation that Applicant \u201cdoes not have any psychiatric . . . substance use \ncondition, dispositions, or behavior patterns that could threaten his reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment in the context of safeguarding classified information or working in cleared setting.\u201d \nAE Q at 5. The Government stated that he saw nothing in the evaluation to establish that the \npsychologist \u201chas a Security Clearance themselves or has had a Security Clearance and know[s] \nwhat that context is. . . . I object to that particular thing because . . . the basis has not been \nestablished.\u201d Tr. at 17-18. In response to the Government\u2019s objection, the Judge stated, \u201cI agree \nwith you\u201d but admitted the psychological evaluation into evidence, noting he would give it the \nweight it deserves. Id. at 18. \nThe day after the hearing, Applicant submitted the psychologist\u2019s curriculum vitae (CV) \nas AE Y. The Judge\u2019s decision does not reflect whether he admitted AE Y into evidence, but he \ndoes cite it in a finding, discussed in the next paragraph. The CV reflects that the psychologist has \nheld positions as a Senior Psychological Health Advisor and Chief Behavioral Health Officer in \nNational Guard units and was then serving as the Command Psychologist in a special operations \nunit. AE Y at 4-6. Furthermore, his CV reflects that he held a Top-Secret security clearance since \n2013, and he completed numerous military courses and received several military medals and other \nawards. Id. at 1-3. \nSecond, the Judge erred in finding Applicant had a \u201cPhD in Philosophy in Counseling \nPsychology.\u201d Decision at 2. In making that finding, the Judge cited to AE Y, obviously confusing \nthe psychologist\u2019s and Applicant\u2019s educational qualifications. This finding shows that the Judge \nthought that AE Y was Applicant\u2019s CV. In the decision, the Judge did not mention the \npsychologist\u2019s evaluation in either his findings of fact or in his analysis, which would tend to \nindicate that he gave the evaluation little or no weight. Given these circumstances, it is not \nunreasonable to conclude that this combination of errors led the Judge to discount AE Q, the \npsychological evaluation, because he was unaware of the psychologist\u2019s background and \nqualifications. A judge is not required to discuss each and every piece of record evidence; however, \nhis failure to discuss important aspects of a case is error. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-07874 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Jul. 7, 2005). Considering the emphasis placed on the psychologist\u2019s evaluation and \nsecurity clearance history by the Government and Judge at hearing, these were important aspects \nof the case and should have been addressed in the decision. \nApplicant also argues that the Judge omitted consideration of one of Applicant\u2019s negative \ndrug test results in his mitigation analysis. In his decision, the Judge noted that Applicant \n\u201csubmitted negative drug test results from March of 2023,\u201d citing AE V. In addition to the March \n2023 results, Applicant also submitted a negative drug test from January 2023, which was included \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nin the record as AE R. While, again, a judge is not required to discuss each and every piece of \nrecord evidence, the Judge\u2019s reference to one but not both negative test results, when viewed in \nlight of there being missing references to other significant record evidence, suggests that the Judge \ndid not consider Applicant\u2019s earlier result. These errors are sufficient to rebut the presumption that \nthe Judge considered all of the record evidence. We are unable to conclude these errors were \nharmless. \nMarijuana Use and Use of Other Illegal Drugs \nApplicant contends that the Judge\u2019s analysis of the evidence was inadequate. We agree. As \nthe Board has previously stated, a judge\u2019s decision must be written in a manner that allows the \nparties and the Board to discern what conclusions he or she is reaching. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n16-02536 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 23, 2018). Furthermore, a judge cannot ignore, disregard, or fail to \ndiscuss significant record evidence that a reasonable person would expect to be taken into account \nin reaching a fair and reasoned decision. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-02903 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. \n9, 2017). In this case, the Judge considered all of Applicant\u2019s drug use together in a very succinct \nmitigation analysis that, besides the standard Guideline H language, consisted of four sentences. \nIn doing so, the Judge failed to address significant factual and legal differences between \nApplicant\u2019s state-compliant marijuana use and his other illegal drug use. This was an important \naspect that a reasonable person would have expected the Judge to address. \nRegarding the other illegal drug use allegations, Applicant used Ecstasy, LSD, cocaine, \nand hallucinogenic mushrooms a limited number of times (once to four times depending on the \ndrug) from 2016 to 2018. During that period, he was about 21 to 23 years old and was attending \ncollege and graduate school. Applicant signed a letter of intent to not use illegal drugs in the future. \nThe Judge found that \u201cApplicant\u2019s testimony was forthright and his integrity was apparent.\u201d \nDecision at 3. Since Applicant\u2019s non-marijuana drug misuse was limited in frequency, happened \nwhen he was a young student, and ceased about five years ago, a reasonable person would expect \nthe Judge to determine whether or not that drug misuse was \u201cunlikely to recur or does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, judgment, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 26(a)(emphasis \nadded). \nWith respect to his marijuana use, Applicant admitted that \u201che used marijuana between \n75~100 times during the time period December of 2013 and May of 2022.\u201d Decision at 2. Under \nthe facts of this case, Applicant\u2019s marijuana use is distinguishable from his other illegal drug use, \nparticularly considering the nature, recency, and frequency of these different types of drug use. In \nresponse to the increasing number of state and local governments that have legalized or \ndecriminalized the use of marijuana, the Security Executive Agent issued a Clarifying Guidance \nConcerning Marijuana for Agencies Conducting Adjudications of Persons Proposed for Eligibility \nfor Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (SecEA Clarifying \nGuidance) in December 2021. This Guidance instructs, among other things, that \u201cprior recreational \nmarijuana use by an individual may be relevant to adjudications but not determinative,\u201d and \nreiterates the requirement that agencies utilize the Whole-Person Concept \u201cto carefully weigh a \nnumber of variables in an individual\u2019s life to determine whether that individual\u2019s behavior raises \na security concern, if at all, and whether that concern has been mitigated such that the individual \nmay now receive a favorable adjudicative determination.\u201d SecEA Clarifying Guidance at 2.

In this case, the Judge \nfailed to conduct an appropriate analysis of Applicant\u2019s state-compliant marijuana use under the \nSecEA Clarifying Guidance. \nApplicant\u2019s use of marijuana after submitting an SCA also merits discussion.1 SOR \u00b6 1.a \nalleged that Applicant used marijuana from December 2013 to May 2022, whereas SOR \u00b6 1.g \nalleged that he used marijuana in May 2022 after having completed an SCA a month earlier. As \nwritten, SOR \u00b6 1.g does not raise any security concerns or, if proven, establish any Guideline H \ndisqualifying conditions that are not already covered by SOR \u00b6 1.a. In the decision, the Judge \nfound against Applicant on SOR \u00b6 1.g after finding he used marijuana at least once after executing \nhis SCA. However, the Judge did not conduct any analysis of the security significance of the \nconduct alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g. \u201cAs the Appeal Board previously stated, after applying for a security \nclearance and being adequately placed on notice that such conduct was inconsistent with holding \na security clearance, an applicant who continues to use marijuana demonstrates a disregard for \nsecurity clearance eligibility standards, and such behavior raises substantial questions about the \napplicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 21-02534 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 13, 2023) (citing ISCR Case No. 20-02974 at 6 (App. \nBd. Feb. 1. 2022)). The effective timing of such notice is fact dependent. In the present case, the \nfact that Applicant used marijuana after completing an SCA is only relevant if the evidence \nestablishes that he understood the security significance of further marijuana use after initiating the \nsecurity clearance process and that he demonstrated a disregard of the security clearance eligibility \nstandards by continuing such use. Here, the Judge erred in failing to make any findings or \nconclusions that Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana after completing an SCA had any added security \nsignificance that raised questions about his reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, or regulations. Absent such findings or analysis, SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a and 1.g were essentially duplicative, and the Judge should have found in favor of Applicant on \nat least one of them. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-04704 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2005) (addressing \na judge\u2019s formal findings on duplicative SOR allegations).2 \nBased on the foregoing, we conclude that the Judge\u2019s analysis of the evidence was arbitrary \nand capricious, which constitutes a harmful error. \nConclusion \nIn light of the harmful errors identified, above, the best resolution of this case is to remand \nit to the Judge to correct the errors and for further processing consistent with the Directive. Upon \nremand, a Judge is required to issue a new decision. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.35. The Board retains no \n1 Applicant testified that his use of marijuana after submitting his SCA occurred at his sister\u2019s engagement. He stated, \n\u201cLike, she just offered, and I truly did not think at the time that it was frowned upon since I did not have a Security \nClearance or access to classified information. So, I did not think that it was going to be a problem.\u201d Tr. at 38. He \nfurther indicated that he did not know of his company\u2019s drug-free policy at that time, and he immediately self-reported \nhis conduct when he learned about the policy. Id. at 38-39. \n2 SOR \u00b6 1.g also raises a due process issue about whether Applicant was placed on adequate notice of the specific \nreason for denying him security clearance eligibility, which is not ripe for discussion at this time. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \njurisdiction over a remanded decision.

Mendez, Esq., Deputy Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nPro se \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nJanuary 18, 2023, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for \nthat decision\u2015security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) in Appendix A of Security Executive Agent \nDirective 4 (effective Jun. 8, 2017) and DoD Directive 5220.6 (January 2, 1992, as amended) \n(Directive).  Applicant requested a decision based on the administrative record without a hearing. \nOn October 5, 2023, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals Administrative Judge Richard A. \nCefola denied Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility. Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \n\u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant has 14 delinquent debts. In responding to the SOR, \nApplicant admitted nine allegations and generally asserted that she was unaware of the remaining \ndebts, while providing explanations for each. The Judge found against Applicant on nine of the \ndebts while deciding in her favor on five allegations.

Additionally, she provides new evidence to explain past assertions or to show \nsubsequent resolution of debts. Finally, she argues that her actions to resolve her financial \ndelinquencies support reconsideration of her clearance eligibility. Appeal Brief at 1-4. \nFirst, we note the decision acknowledges and admits Applicant\u2019s May 12, 2023, response \nto the FORM, and the Judge\u2019s findings of fact reflect items that are contained in the response. \nNext, the Judge noted that Applicant \u201chas worked for a Federal Contractor since October of 2019.\u201d \nDecision at 2.

See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 18-00110 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 31, 2020). \nFinally, Applicant presented on appeal revised explanations and new evidence submitted \nto show her efforts to resolve debts. Much of this evidence was not presented in response to the \nSOR or the FORM and was unavailable to the Judge when he issued his decision. The Appeal \nBoard is prohibited from considering new evidence on appeal. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29. \nIt should be understood that once the Government presents evidence raising security \nconcerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to establish mitigation.

Rather, their application requires the \nexercise of sound discretion in light of the record evidence as a whole. Thus, the presence of some \nmitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance \ndecision. As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether \nthe favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa. An applicant\u2019s \ndisagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different \ninterpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate that the Judge weighed the evidence \nor reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007). \nThe Appeal Board does not review cases de novo.  The Board\u2019s authority to review a case \nis limited to cases in which the appealing party has alleged the Judge committed harmful error. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.32.

On March 24, 2023, Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals Administrative Judge Bryan J. Olmos denied Applicant\u2019s request for a \nsecurity clearance. Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. For the \nreasons set forth below, we reverse. \nThe SOR alleged ten delinquent debts totaling approximately $28,000. The Judge found in \nfavor of Applicant on two debts totaling about $360, and against him on the remaining financial \nconcerns. On appeal, Applicant provides new evidence in the form of narrative and documentary \nupdates regarding the status of seven of the eight debts for which the Judge found against him. The \nAppeal Board is prohibited from considering new evidence on appeal. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.

This allegation and explanation \nwarrant review on appeal. \nJudge\u2019s Findings and Analysis \nApplicant, in his early 50s, has been married to his current wife since 1999 and has one \nminor and four adult children. He served in the military from 1992 to 1996 and from 1998 to 2001, \nand he was honorably discharged from both periods of service. He has served in either a Reserve \nor National Guard capacity since 2009. Applicant experienced financial difficulties in early 2020 \nwhen the COVID-19 pandemic began and his wife, a registered nurse, left her employment and \nApplicant became their sole source of income. His wife did not return to work until December \n2022. \nApplicant purchased the vehicle underlying the subject debt in 2013. In 2017, he was \nnotified that a lawsuit had been filed by a state against the creditor for unfair loan practices and he \nmight be eligible for compensation under a proposed settlement. Following receipt of this \ninformation, he stopped paying on the loan. He claimed that the creditor never contacted him again \nand he took no steps to confirm his inclusion in the lawsuit. He also did not contact the creditor \nuntil January 2023, at which time he was told that he was not included in the 2017 settlement and \nthe loan had been charged off. In response to this information, Applicant made a $300 payment on \nthe debt; however, he subsequently investigated the account further and determined that he was \nlisted as the owner on the vehicle\u2019s title (the \u201cTitle\u201d), free of any liens. In support of this \nexplanation, Applicant provided a copy of the Title, which indeed reflects Applicant as the current \nregistered owner and identifies no lienholders. Applicant Exhibit G. \nDespite Applicant\u2019s explanation that \u201che had title to the vehicle free of any liens,\u201d the Judge \nfound that the account was not resolved because the \u201cdebt is reflected as charged off in both credit \nreports in the record.\u201d Decision at 3. The Judge also found that Applicant had \u201cnot established a \nreasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of [the] debt\u201d and concluded that, overall, Applicant \n\u201cdid not provide sufficient evidence to mitigate the financial security concerns.\u201d Decision at 7, 8. \nDiscussion \nIn deciding whether a judge\u2019s conclusions are erroneous, the Appeal Board will review the \ndecision to determine whether it \u201cfails to examine relevant evidence, fails to articulate a rational \nconnection between the facts found and the choice made, fails to be based on a consideration of \nrelevant factors, involves a clear error of judgment, fails to consider an important aspect of the \ncase, or is so implausible as to indicate more than a mere difference of opinion.\u201d ISCR Case No. \n94-0215 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Apr. 13, 1995) (citing Motor Vehicle Mfr. Ass\u2019n v. State Farm Mut. Ins. \nCo., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)). \nA judge need not discuss every piece of record evidence in rendering a decision. See, e.g., \nISCR Case No. 15-02903 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 9, 2017). A judge cannot, however, \u201cignore, \ndisregard, or fail to discuss significant record evidence that a reasonable person could expect to be \n[considered] in reaching a fair and reasoned decision.\u201d Id. Here, the Judge made no finding about \nthe Title and its confirmation that no lienholders exist. As a result, his analysis failed to consider \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nan important aspect of the case and, in particular, the applicability of AG 20(e). Applicant\u2019s \nexplanation that he believed he was included in the 2017 settlement is \u201ca reasonable basis to \ndispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt,\u201d which is apparently substantiated by the Title and the \nabsence of any lienholders thereon. A reasonable person would expect this piece of evidence to be \nspecifically addressed and failing to do so was in error. \nMoreover, in not acknowledging this piece of evidence, the Judge also failed to reconcile \nthe conflicting information presented between it and the credit reports. When the record contains \nconflicting evidence, the Judge \u201cmust carefully weigh the evidence in a reasonable, common sense \nmanner and make findings that reflect a reasonable interpretation of the evidence that takes into \naccount all the record evidence.\u201d ISCR Case No. 99-0435 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2000). The Judge \nfailed to articulate how he reconciled the discrepancy between the credit reports and the lien-free \nTitle when he concluded that the vehicle debt is still owing. \u201cThe Board must consider not only \nwhether there is evidence supporting a Judge\u2019s findings, but also whether there is evidence that \nfairly detracts from the weight of the evidence supporting those findings.\u201d ISCR Case No. 97-0727 \nat 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 3, 1998). We believe that, in this case, the Title \u2013 a legal document \u2013 detracts \nfrom the weight of the credit reports and find Applicant\u2019s explanation coupled with his \ndocumentation more persuasive than the disputed information on his credit reports. \nIn the case before us, we note the Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant\u2019s remaining financial \nproblems, which total only about $4,400, resulted to some extent from circumstances beyond his \ncontrol. This conclusion is consistent with the record that was before him, which included evidence \nthat the family\u2019s financial resources were reduced due to his wife\u2019s unemployment during the \nCOVID-19 pandemic. We also note that those debts did not become delinquent until, at the earliest, \nmid-2021, and in the case of the four past-due accounts, only became delinquent in mid-2022. See \nFile of Relevant Material Item 5 at 2-4. The record also reflects that Applicant established payment \nplans for the debts in early 2023. While true that this was the month following his receipt of the \nSOR, it was also the month following his wife\u2019s reemployment, which Applicant explained \n\u201c\u2018greatly improved\u2019 their finances.\u201d Decision at 4. \nEach case must be decided on its own merits. Based on our review of the record, we \nconclude that the Judge\u2019s decision failed to examine relevant evidence and to consider an important \naspect of the case and is not sustainable.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nChristopher Snowden, Esq. \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nFebruary 13, 2023, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for \nthat decision\u2015security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) in Appendix A of Security Executive Agent \nDirective 4 (effective June 8, 2017) and DoD Directive 5220.6 (January 2, 1992, as amended) \n(Directive). Applicant elected to have the Judge decide the case based on the record, including the \nGovernment\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) and Applicant\u2019s response. On August 31, 2023, \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals Administrative Judge Carol G. Ricciardello denied \nApplicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility. Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and \nE3.1.30, challenging the Judge\u2019s factual findings and her analysis of the evidence. Consistent with \nthe following, we affirm. \nThe SOR alleged six delinquent debts totaling about $21,000, including a charged-off \ncredit-card account. The Judge found in favor of Applicant on the charged-off credit card account, \nand against him on the remaining five debts. In her analysis, the Judge concluded that Applicant \nfailed to establish that there were clear indications that his financial problems were being resolved \nor were under control.  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOn appeal, Applicant\u2019s contention that the Judge failed to properly consider all available \nevidence is not supported by the record. The record reflects that the Judge thoroughly reviewed \ninformation submitted by Applicant in response to the interrogatories, SOR, and FORM, but found \nthem lacking in detail which would convincingly show an adherence to good-faith efforts to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant\u2019s claim that the Judge failed to consider favorable evidence or extenuating \ncircumstances in her decision is misplaced. The Judge noted Applicant\u2019s military service, divorces, \nhealth and COVID-related issues, education, business downturn, and his unemployment in her \ndecision. Applicant\u2019s assertions appear to be additional argument challenging the Judge\u2019s \ninterpretation and weight of the evidence. As we have explained before, there is a difference \nbetween errors in a judge\u2019s findings of fact and errors in the conclusions drawn therefrom. See \nISCR Case No. 22-00822 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 5, 2023). Findings of fact must be supported by \nsubstantial evidence, while conclusions are reasonable inferences drawn from the evidence. See \nISCR Case No. 18-00496 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 8, 2019), citing Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.32.1 and \nE3.1.32.3. \nTo the extent that Applicant is contending the Judge mis-weighed or did not consider \nrecord evidence, we find no merit in those assertions. None of his arguments are enough to rebut \nthe presumption that the Judge considered all of the record evidence or to demonstrate the Judge \nweighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. See, e.g., \nISCR Case No. 21-01169 at 5 (App. Bd. May 13, 2022). \nThe Judge noted that the SOR debts were unpaid for years and correctly cited ISCR Case \nNo. 16-01211 at 4 (App. Bd. May 30, 2018) for the proposition that waiting until a clearance is in \njeopardy before resolving debts shows an applicant may be lacking in judgement expected of those \nwith access to classified information. Decision at 9. It is also well established that an applicant\u2019s \nongoing, unpaid debts demonstrate a continuing course of conduct and can be viewed as recent for \npurposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. \nBd. Feb. 16, 2017). \nApplicant also contends that the Judge mischaracterized the evidence by concluding that \nApplicant closed his business to pursue his educational goals and did not consider Applicant\u2019s \ndivorce at the same time. The Judge\u2019s finding is partly based on Applicant\u2019s statement in his SCA \nwhere he said he \u201cclosed business down and pursued education.\u201d FORM Item 3 at 18. He did not \ndisclose the delinquent business loan in his SCA. The Judge also acknowledged his divorce and \nother factors that may have impacted his finances but found his failure to show good-faith efforts \nto repay creditors or otherwise resolve his debts to be a critical factor in denying mitigating credit. \nApplicant finally agreed to a repayment plan for the business loan in June 2023 despite knowledge \nof it in September 2022. Applicant Exhibit B; FORM Item 4 at 1. He also failed to provide \nsufficient evidence of resolution of the remaining debts. Decision at 8. The Board has held that \nuntil an applicant has a meaningful financial track record, it cannot be said as a matter of law that \nhe has initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolved debts. The \nphrase \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d necessarily includes evidence of actual debt reduction through \npayment on debts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-01920 at 5 (App. Bd.

Applicant requested a decision based on the administrative record. On \nJune 15, 2023, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals Administrative Judge Charles C. Hale \ndenied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 \nE3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nUnder Guideline H, the SOR alleges that Applicant used marijuana with varying frequency \nfrom January 2018 to September 2022. In addition, it alleges that he stated in his March 2022 \nsecurity clearance application (SCA), his March 2022 interview, and his May 2022 response to \ninterrogatories, that he may use marijuana in the future. In his SOR response, Applicant admitted \nthe SOR allegations.

[Decision at 5, citing ISCR Case No. 21-02534 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 13, \n2023).] \nThe Judge found against Applicant on both SOR allegations. In general, the Judge \nconcluded that Applicant\u2019s promises to abstain from future marijuana use if he is granted a security \nclearance does not engender confidence that he has stopped using marijuana or that he will not use \nit in the future. \nOn appeal, Applicant does not specifically assert the Judge committed any error. Rather, \nhe expressed concern about how the decision affects his career and future employment. He argues \nthat he is a young college student that would benefit from a security clearance in his current and \nfuture employment. We are not permitted to consider the adverse impact that an unfavorable \ndecision may have on an applicant. Such an impact is not a relevant consideration in evaluating \nclearance eligibility. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-02397 at 1-2 (App. Bd. May 6, 2020). Applicant \nnotes that he is taking illegal drug use seriously, has tested negative for drugs, does not intend to \nuse marijuana in the future, and has matured from this experience. The Appeal Board is prohibited \nfrom considering new evidence on appeal. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.

In completing her 2016 SCA, Applicant answered \n\u201cNo\u201d to the question seeking disclosure of any drug use in the prior seven years. Applicant \ncompleted another SCA in July 2019, wherein she again denied any reportable drug use in the \nprior seven years. Applicant affirmed her response about drug use during her September 2019 \nsubject interview. In January 2020, however, Applicant\u2019s sister was interviewed and revealed that \nApplicant is a member of Narcotics Anonymous (NA). The next day, Applicant contacted her \ninterviewer to disclose that she had lied during the earlier interview. She then disclosed various \ndrug and alcohol use that occurred during her late-teens and 20s, which prompted her to join NA \nin 1995 and she thereafter remained drug- and alcohol-free for about 17 years. She resumed \ndrinking several times between 2012 and 2019 but has abstained from alcohol since mid-2019. \nApplicant also used marijuana two times after joining NA, in late 2013 and mid-2016, both while \nholding a security clearance. She continues to participate regularly in NA. \nThe Judge found that Applicant\u2019s two marijuana uses in 2013 and 2016 were fully \nmitigated by the passage of time and because the use was infrequent and occurred under unusual \ncircumstances.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nChristopher Snowden, Esq. \nOn May 23, 2022, the Department of Defense (DoD) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) \npursuant to DoD Manual 5200.02 (Apr. 3, 2017, as amended) (DoDM 5200.02) advising Applicant \nthat her conduct raised security concerns under Guideline E (Personal Conduct), Guideline K \n(Handing Protected Information), and Guideline M (Use of Information Technology) of the \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines. On July 20, 2022, Applicant submitted a response to \nthe SOR.  \nOn October 4, 2022, DoD Consolidated Adjudication Services (CAS) revoked Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for access to classified information, and she appealed that revocation under the \nprovisions of DoDM 5200.02. On December 2, 2022, Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence \nand Security) Ronald Moultrie issued a memorandum that DoD civilian and military personnel \nwhose clearance eligibility was revoked or denied between September 30, 2022, and the date of \nthat memorandum, shall be provided the opportunity to pursue the hearing and appeal process as \nset forth in DoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAs a result of Secretary Moultrie\u2019s memo, Applicant was given the opportunity to receive \nthe process set forth in the Directive, and she elected that process. On March 16, 2023, after \nconducting a hearing, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge \nJennifer I. Goldstein denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. Applicant appealed \npursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. For reasons stated below, we affirm the Judge\u2019s \ndecision. \nFindings of Facts and Conclusions \nApplicant, who is in her 40s, served as a general engineer in her most recent employment \nfrom which she medically retired in December 2022. Appeal Brief at 1. The SOR alleged that she \nhas a history of workplace misconduct spanning four separate employers. In her analysis, the Judge \nsummarized the significant facts of the case as follows: \nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) \nFrom 2012 through 2022, Applicant\u2019s employment-related conduct \ndemonstrated a history of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, \nlack of candor, and unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. First, while \nemployed by the Navy from 2011 to 2013, she received a letter of caution for failing \nto follow her supervisor\u2019s instructions and engaging in inappropriate behavior by \nalienating customers. She also violated base rules by bringing a cell phone into an \narea where cell phones were prohibited. Additionally, while working for Employer \nThree, Applicant was terminated for violating the employer\u2019s policy, demonstrating \nnegligence, disruptiveness, unprofessionalism, and for interjecting herself into \nthings not related to her job.  \nSimilarly, Applicant displayed this same type of conduct while working for \nEmployer Five. From September 2021 through her suspension in September 2022, \nshe blatantly disregarded the instruction of her supervisor at least 13 times. She was \nfirst counseled on her inappropriate and unprofessional behavior in September \n2021. Despite counseling, she failed to bring work-related concerns to her \nsupervisor as instructed in the counseling and sent multiple inappropriate emails to \nthe entire staff. She repeatedly used her government email address to send messages \nrelated to areas outside of her employment duties, even after being explicitly \ninstructed not to do so in writing at least four times. Her conduct, unrelated to her \nallegations of discrimination and retaliation, establishes a pattern of rule violations \nand demonstrates questionable judgment.  [Decision at 20-21.] \n* * * \nApplicant\u2019s disregard of her employers\u2019 directions is well documented and has been \nreported repeatedly over her career. Further, her conduct is recent. While she \nacknowledged at least one instance of improperly using her government email to \nobtain the DTRA [Defense Threat Reduction Agency] report, she failed to take \nresponsibility for her actions. She knew it was wrong to use her government email, \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nyet she chose to do so repeatedly. Instead of accepting responsibility for her \nimproper actions, she blamed others and claimed she was being retaliated against.  \nHer conduct continues to reflect poorly on her judgment.  [Decision at 21.] \nGuideline K (Handling Protected Information) \nApplicant failed to follow the guidance of her supervisors when it came to \nhandling protected information while employed by Employers Three and Five.  \nWhile employed by Employer Three, she shared three proprietary documents in \nviolation of the employer\u2019s policies. While at Employer Five, she committed a \nseries of inappropriate actions with respect to protected information, including: \ncompiling OSINT [open-source intelligence] against the direction of her \nsupervisor; disseminating that compilation over an unclassified government email \nnetwork; and not using the proper CUI [controlled unclassified information] \nmarkings on that documentation. [Decision at 22.] \nNone of the Guideline K mitigating conditions apply to Applicant\u2019s misconduct, which is \nrecent and demonstrates a recurring pattern.  Disregarding repeated attempts of her supervisors to \nprovide her guidance, Applicant failed to comply with safeguards and failed to demonstrate a \npositive attitude toward discharging her security responsibilities. \nGuideline M (Use of Information Technology) \nThe evidence shows she misused her government email on multiple \noccasions including contacting DTRA, and that she disseminated OSINT that she \ncollected. Applicant did so even though her actions were not part of her official \nduties, and she continued to do so even after she had been instructed by her \nsupervisor to cease such activities. Applicant acknowledged improperly using her \ngovernment email to contact DTRA.  [Decision at 23.] \nApplicant\u2019s misuse of her government email was unrelated to her assigned tasks. This \nconduct was a deliberate violation of her supervisor\u2019s directives to not engage in such activities \nusing Government assets. Applicant made no good-faith effort to correct her conduct.   \nDiscussion \nScope of Review \nThere is no presumption of error below, and the appealing party must raise claims of error \nwith specificity, identify how the Judge committed factual or legal error, and cite to specific \nportions of the record supporting any alleged error. Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.30 and E3.1.32. See also \nISCR Case No. 02-12199 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 8, 2005). The Appeal Board does not review a case \nde novo. Id. Instead, our scope of review is narrow, and we may not substitute our judgment for \nthat of the Judge. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-07766 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 26, 2006). More \nspecifically, the Board\u2019s scope of review is limited to deciding whether: (1) the Judge\u2019s findings \nof fact are supported by substantial evidence, which is defined in the next section; (2) the Judge \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncomplied with the procedures required by Executive Order 10865 and the Directive; and (3) the \nJudge\u2019s rulings or conclusions are not arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32. \nA Judge\u2019s conclusions are often subjective in nature and are sustainable if they constitute \nreasonable inferences drawn from the evidence. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-02225 at 2-3 (App. \nBd. Jun. 25, 2019). See also ISCR Case No. 02-12199 at 2 (setting forth the standard applied in \nanalyzing whether the Judge\u2019s conclusions are erroneous). If an appealing party demonstrates \nfactual or legal error, then the Board must consider whether the error is harmful or harmless; \nwhether the Judge\u2019s decision can be affirmed on alternate grounds; and, if the Judge\u2019s decision \ncannot be affirmed, whether it should be remanded or reversed. Id. at 3. See also Directive \u00b6\u00b6 \nE3.1.32 and E3.1.33. \nChallenges to the Findings of Fact \nAt the outset, it is noted that Applicant\u2019s brief applies the wrong standard of proof in \nchallenging the legal sufficiency of the Judge\u2019s findings of fact. In the beginning of her brief, \nApplicant correctly states that a Judge\u2019s findings of fact must be supported by \u201csubstantial \nevidence,\u201d i.e., such \u201crelevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support \na conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d Appeal Brief at 3 and 10 (citing \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). Applicant further states, \u201c\u2018Substantial evidence\u2019 is \u2018more than a scintilla \nbut less than a preponderance.\u2019\u201d Appeal Brief at 10 (quoting See v. Washington Metro. Area \nTransit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)). Several times, however, Applicant incorrectly \napplies the \u201cpreponderance of the evidence\u201d standard in challenging the Judge\u2019s specific findings, \nwhich undercuts her arguments. Appeal Brief at 11, 14. At this point, it also merits noting that \nDirective \u00b6 E.1.32.1 provides the Appeal Board shall give deference to the Judge\u2019s credibility \ndeterminations in reviewing the findings of fact. In her decision, the Judge concluded that \nApplicant\u2019s \u201ccredibility is questionable.\u201d Decision at 25. Based on our review of the record, we \nfind no reason not to defer to that credibility determination. \nThe Judge found that Applicant violated Employer Three\u2019s policy by sharing proprietary \ndocuments with the Government client. Decision at 5. Applicant contends that the Government \npresented insufficient evidence to show that she mishandled proprietary information. Appeal Brief \nat 5, 10-11, 13-14, 16. Applicant argues that proprietary information involves a property interest \nand that the Judge \u201cprovides no rationale for how the disclosures constituted a property interest of \n[Employer Three].\u201d Appeal Brief at 11. We construe Applicant\u2019s argument as asserting that the \nGovernment failed to establish that the information in question was proprietary information. We \ndo not find this argument persuasive. \nAt the hearing, Applicant offered into evidence documents that established she mishandled \nEmployer Three\u2019s proprietary information. Applicant Exhibit (AE) 1-D. This included portions \nof a DoD Report of Investigation reflecting that Employer Three reported that Applicant \u201cviolated \n[its] policy by sharing [its] proprietary documents with the government client.\u201d Id. at 5. The Judge \ncould rely on the company\u2019s representations that the information at issue was propriety information \nwithout having the company disclose the exact nature of that information or, as Applicant claims, \nprove it had a property interest in that information. As the Board has previously stated, we give \ndeference to a company\u2019s findings and conclusions in its security investigations. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 15-08385 at 4 (App. Bd. May 23, 2018). In the classified information context, we have \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nstated that, \u201cbecause of the unique position of employers as actual administrators of classified \nprograms and the degree of knowledge possessed by them in any particular case, their \ndeterminations and characterizations regarding security violations are entitled to considerable \ndeference, and should not be discounted or contradicted without a cogent explanation.\u201d ISCR Case \nNo. 10-07070 at 8 (App. Bd. Apr. 19, 2012). The same reasoning applies to a company\u2019s \ndeterminations and characterizations regarding violations of its policies on the safeguarding and \nhandling of sensitive information, such as propriety information. In this regard, the Judge was not \nrequired to accept Applicant\u2019s claim that no proprietary information was shared (SOR Response \nat 15) and instead had to weigh that claim in light of all the record evidence. \nApplicant also contends that the Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant \u201ccompil[ed] OSINT \nagainst the direction of her supervisor; disseminat[ed] that compilation over an unclassified \ngovernment email network and [failed to use] the proper CUI markings on that documentation\u201d \n(Decision at 22) is contradicted by an earlier finding that \u2013 as summarized by Applicant \u2013 she only \n\u201cpossibly transmitted protected material.\u201d Appeal Brief at 11, 13, 14. This argument, however, \nmisconstrues the relied-upon finding and conflates two issues: 1) that Applicant transmitted \ncompiled material over an unclassified network without proper CUI markings; and 2) that by virtue \nof her compiling the material, even from open sources, she was potentially altering the \nclassification status of the compilation. Contrary to Applicant\u2019s summarized finding, the Judge \nfound that Applicant\u2019s command was concerned that she was compiling and sending OSINT \ninformation over an unclassified network and that \u201cby adding her own analysis to the open-source \nintelligence, it is possible to elevate the classification level from what was unclassified open-\nsource material to something of a higher classification.\u201d Decision at 9. Applicant appears to argue \nthat, because the evidence establishes only that she possibly altered the classification status of \nvarious material through her compilation, the Government failed to establish that her transmission \nof the material over an unclassified network was improper. This conclusion does not follow. The \nJudge\u2019s finding about the possible elevation of classification status of compiled open-source \nmaterial is well supported by the record, as is that Applicant was repeatedly instructed to stop \ncompiling and transmitting such material over an unclassified network, and that she disregarded \nthose instructions. See Tr.-1 at 61-62, 86-87, 123-124; Government Exhibit (GE) 8 at 1; GE 9 at \n1; GE 10 at 1; GE 14; AE 1-A at 326. We find no error in the Judge\u2019s findings or conclusions that \nfollowed.  \nApplicant failed to show that any of the Judge\u2019s findings of fact were defective. From our \nreview of the record, the Judge\u2019s material findings of a security concern are based on substantial \nevidence or constitute reasonable inferences that could be drawn from the evidence. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 17-02225 at 2-3. \nChallenges to the Conclusions \nApplicant\u2019s brief claims that the Judge erred in failing to comply with the provisions in \nExecutive Order 10865 and the Directive by not considering all the evidence and by not properly \napplying the mitigating conditions and whole-person concept. These arguments amount to a \ndisagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, which is a matter within the Judge\u2019s \nspecial province. See, e.g., Inwood Laboratories, Inc. v. Ives Laboratories Inc., 456 U.S. 844, 856 \n(1982). As the trier of fact, the Judge must use commonsense in evaluating the evidence and \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconsider the record as a whole. Directive \u00b6 6.3 and Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6 2(c). The Judge is responsible \nfor resolving conflicts in the evidence and has discretion in weighing the evidence, both favorable \nand unfavorable. In analyzing the evidence, a Judge is not required to accept unrebutted testimony \nor other evidence uncritically or without considering it in relation to all relevant and material \nevidence in the record. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 98-0265 at 4, n. 2 (App. Bd. Mar. 17, 1999). \nAn appealing party\u2019s lengthy or strong disagreements with the Judge\u2019s conclusions and \nwhole-person analysis are not necessarily sufficient to demonstrate error. To establish error, an \nappealing party must demonstrate the Judge\u2019s analysis or conclusions were arbitrary, capricious, \nor contrary to law.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.3. \nIn her brief, Applicant raises several challenges to the Judge\u2019s analysis and conclusions. \nFor example, Applicant argues that the Judge did not place appropriate weight on her character \nevidence, including individuals who stated that Applicant was not difficult to work with; that she \nwas the target of attacks by people who were much less qualified; and that she was dismissed for \ntrying to follow the regulations. She further claims that she was not provided appropriate training \non OSINT and the proper channels for disseminating that information. In essence, Applicant is \nadvocating for an alternative weighing of the evidence. The existence of mitigating evidence, \nhowever, does not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision. In \nweighing the evidence, the Judge must decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the \nunfavorable evidence, or vice versa. A party\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the \nevidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to \ndemonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, \ncapricious, or contrary to law. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-01431 at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 31, 2020). \nBased on our review, we conclude that none of Applicant\u2019s arguments are sufficient to \nrebut the presumption that the Judge considered all of the record evidence or to demonstrate the \nJudge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. See, \ne.g., ISCR Case No. 21-01169 at 5 (App. Bd. May 13, 2022). Furthermore, contrary to Applicant\u2019s \nassertions, we also conclude that the Judge\u2019s whole-person analysis satisfies the requirements of \nDirective \u00b6 6.3, in that the Judge evaluated Applicant\u2019s security-significant circumstances in light \nof the entirety of the record evidence. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-02806 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 9, \n2015). \nClaim of Reprisal for Whistleblowing \nApplicant\u2019s brief asserts that adverse actions were taken against her, including the attempt \nto revoke her security clearance, because she voiced concerns over safety hazards, violations of \nregulations, and discrimination. She further states that \u201cthe process to revoke a security clearance \nwas never meant to circumvent legitimate methods of adjudicating employment disputes.\u201d Appeal \nBrief at 1. \nPresidential Policy Directive-19 and 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 3341(j) provide protections to cleared \nFederal Government employees who are whistleblowers.

PROHIBITION ON RETALIATION BY AFFECTING ELIGIBIILLTY \nFOR ACCESS TO CLASSIFIED INFORMATION. \na. It is strictly prohibited to take, fail to take, or threaten to take or fail to \ntake any action affecting an individual\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation as a reprisal for a protected disclosure of fraud, waste, or abuse \npursuant to Presidential Policy Directive/PPD 19. \nb. Employees may appeal actions affecting eligibility for access to classified \ninformation allegedly taken as a reprisal for a protected disclosure of fraud, waste, \nor abuse in violation of Presidential Policy Directive/PPD 19. \nc. All personnel security adjudicators, DOHA administrative judges (AJs), \nand Personnel Security Appeals Boards (PSABs) will, as part of their adjudication \nof an individual\u2019s eligibility, consider and resolve any claims of reprisal for \nwhistleblowing.  \nPPD-19 \u00b6 F(5) defines \u201cProtected Disclosure\u201d as an employee\u2019s disclosure to a supervisor \nin his or her chain of command, an Inspector General, or certain other officials of information that \nhe or she \u201creasonably believes evidences (i) a violation of any law, rule, or regulation; or (ii) gross \nmismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger \nto public health or safety\u201d as well as other disclosures identified in that Directive. Under 50 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 3341(j)(4)(C), a Federal agency shall find a retaliation violation if the protected disclosure \u201cwas \na contributing factor in the adverse security clearance or access determination taken against the \nindividual, unless the agency demonstrates by a preponderance of the evidence that it would have \ntaken the same action in the absence of such disclosure, giving the utmost deference to the agency\u2019s \nassessment of the particular threat to the national security interests of the United States in the \ninstant matter.\u201d See also Security Executive Agent Directive 9, Appellate Review of Retaliation \nRegarding Security Clearance and Access Determinations.  \nIn her decision, the Judge reviewed Applicant\u2019s whistleblower-reprisal claims to determine \nwhether they may have been a contributing factor in the review of her security clearance eligibility. \nAfter first identifying Applicant\u2019s various whistleblower reprisal complaints, the Judge concluded: \n[E]ven if those complaints were true, based on the entire record, I am satisfied that \nthe DOD CAS would have acted on [Applicant\u2019s] security clearance in the absence \nof her complaints. Her failure to follow supervisory instructions at Employers One \nand Five, conduct unbecoming of a federal employee, inappropriate behavior in the \nworkplace of Employers Three and Five, and unapproved volunteer activity on \ngovernment time while working for Employer Five are sufficient to establish, by a \npreponderance of the evidence, that the SOR would have been issued in the absence \nof her complaints. Her protected disclosures were not contributing factors in the \nadverse security access determination.  [Decision at 26-27.] \nIn this regard, it merits noting that Applicant\u2019s transmissions of OSINT over the \ncommand\u2019s unclassified computer network was one of several key security concerns that led to \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe review of her security clearance eligibility. At the hearing, Applicant testified that she was \ninvolved in \u201cgray space\u201d or \u201cgray operations,\u201d which she explained was operating \u201cin between \nlines of official versus unofficial\u201d actions. Tr.-3 at 123; AE 27; Decision at 2-3. Some of her \u201cgray \noperation\u201d activities included supplying data to military intelligence groups, helping to map flight \npaths, and assisting individuals with visas to come to the United States from a war-torn country. \nId. \nThe record evidence sets forth several instances in which Applicant transmitted OSINT \nunrelated to her official responsibilities over the command\u2019s unclassified computer network in \nviolation of supervisory instructions, directions, and orders. Some notable events regarding this \nissue are summarized below. \na. On December 20, 2021, Applicant was issued a letter of reprimand, in part, for misusing \nher Government email account by sending emails unrelated to her professional duties. These \nemails concerned container ships entering the United States. In one of those emails, Applicant \nindicated that she knew individuals who could assist in conducting reconnaissance of these ships. \nDecision at 9-11; GE 4 at 2; GE 7 at 1. \nb. On February 16, 2022, Applicant sent an email to her supervisor, an intelligence officer, \nand other senior members of Employer Five over the command\u2019s unclassified network that \ndiscussed hypersonic threats at certain locations outside the United States. Decision at 12. In a \nrelated memorandum for the record, Applicant\u2019s supervisor noted that Applicant is not assigned \nto the intelligence field, that intelligence professionals within the command expressed concerns \nabout Applicant transmitting \u201cthreat assessments\u201d over the unclassified network, and that they \nrecommended she confine such transmissions to the classified network. GE 8 at 1. The day after \nreceiving Applicant\u2019s email, her supervisor replied and instructed Applicant to refrain from \nsending such emails over the unclassified network \u201cto mitigate classification, OPSEC [operational \nsecurity], and OSINT concerns.\u201d Id. Based on her supervisor\u2019s email, Applicant should have \nunderstood that transmitting OSINT over the unclassified network with her comments or analysis \nraised issues about whether such actions elevated that information to the level of classified \ninformation and, thereby, created a security violation. Approximately five minutes after her \nsupervisor\u2019s response, Applicant replied by stating the information was gathered from open \nsources. Id. About three hours later, Applicant disobeyed her supervisor by sending an email \nregarding a country involved in a military conflict; however, she did not include her supervisor on \nthat email. Id. Shortly after receipt of this latter email, an intelligence officer replied directly to \nApplicant, noting that her email\u2019s contents should have been restricted to the classified network, \nher comments were not related to the command\u2019s mission, and, if collection of open-source \nintelligence was required, specially trained OSINT professionals would perform that function. In \nthe memorandum for the record, her supervisor indicated that Applicant\u2019s conduct was \nunacceptable and posed a potential threat to national security.  Id. at 2. \nc. On February 24, 2022, the command\u2019s Operations Director notified Applicant that her \naccess to classified information was being suspended. GE 9. Of note, the Operations Director was \nneither in Applicant\u2019s chain of command nor apparently involved in any of her protected \ndisclosures. The Operations Director\u2019s memorandum indicated that the suspension was based on \nvarious instances of Applicant\u2019s questionable conduct, including her transmission of OSINT over \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe command\u2019s unclassified network. The Operations Director also notified her that an incident \nreport must be submitted to DoD CAS, that he was taking that action in his capacity as the Security \nProgram Executive, and that DoD CAS would make a final determination concerning her security \nclearance eligibility. Id. \nd. Despite being directed by her supervisor and an intelligence officer not to transmit \nOSINT over the unclassified network and being advised by the Operations Director that her access \nto classified information was suspended, in part, for making such transmissions, Applicant again \nused the command\u2019s unclassified network for the transmission of OSINT. On March 30, 2022, \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor sent her a memorandum that directed her to cease and desist using her \n\u201cgovernment electronic mail (email) account to collect, transmit, compile, consolidate or otherwise \nredistribute open source intelligence . . . information, and tactical information.\u201d GE 10 at 1. This \nmemo advised her that she is not an intelligence officer and that her responsibilities did not require \nher to engage in open-source intelligence gathering, analysis, or transmission. It was issued after \nher supervisor became aware that Applicant sent two emails on her Government computer on \nMarch 3, 2022, that were unrelated to her official duties. These emails were apparently sent in her \nunofficial \u201cgray operation\u201d role. One of them asked a DTRA contractor to send her information \nabout a power plant fire in a country involved in a military conflict. Her supervisor\u2019s memo noted \nthat their command\u2019s mission did not involve getting DTRA intelligence products to end users and \nthat Applicant\u2019s use of her official Government email in making that request created the \nimpression that her request was part of her official duties. Id. \ne. On May 2, 2022, Applicant sent an email regarding hypersonics that contained an excel \nspreadsheet and other documents. This email resulted in Applicant\u2019s government computer, as \nwell as those of 17 other employees, being seized so that a review could be conducted to determine \nwhether her email created a spillage of classified information over the unclassified network. \nDecision at 15; AE 1-A at 326. Due to this incident, Applicant\u2019s access to DoD networks, DoD \ninformation technology assets, and common access card were suspended. Decision at 15. It also \nresulted in Applicant\u2019s supervisor and the Director of Information Production issuing her a cease\u00ad\nand-desist order on May 18, 2022, prohibiting Applicant from communicating hypersonic \ninformation in any format. AE 1-A at 326. The official review of this potential spillage incident \nlater determined that Applicant\u2019s email contained only CUI and should have been marked \naccordingly. Decision at 17; GE 14. \nf. On May 31, 2022, Applicant\u2019s supervisor issued her a directive that prohibited her from \nusing government-duty time or government resources for intelligence collection, transmission, or \nrelated activities. This directive was generated after Applicant sought contact information on \nintelligence personnel so that she could pass along a tip concerning Taliban activity. AE 1-E at \n321. Applicant violated this directive on June 23, 2022, when she approached an official within \nher division to inform him that she had intelligence information on foreign nationals and possibly \nU.S. persons that required urgent attention, showing him images of passports on her cell phone. \nDecision at 16.  \nApplicant\u2019s contention that the actions taken to revoke her security clearance were in \nretaliation for her being a whistleblower is not supported by the evidence. Besides her bare reprisal \nassertion, she failed to provide any specifics about that claim. In particular, she does not explain \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nher basis for believing a reprisal occurred, does not highlight any portions of the record evidence \nthat would support her claim, and does not assert that the Judge committed any factual or legal \nerror in making findings of fact or conclusions regarding this issue.  \nWe agree with the Judge\u2019s conclusion regarding Applicant\u2019s reprisal claims. Based on our \nreview of the record, we conclude that Applicant\u2019s purported protected disclosures were not a \ncontributing factor in the initiation of the actions taken to revoke her security clearance eligibility \nor in the ultimate unfavorable security clearance determination. Furthermore, a preponderance of \nthe evidence in this case demonstrates that DoD would have taken action to revoke Applicant\u2019s \nsecurity clearance eligibility even if her protected disclosures were a contributing factor in the \ninitiation of the review of her clearance eligibility. \nConclusion \nApplicant has a history of employment-related misconduct at four employers, including \nboth private companies and the Federal Government, between 2012 and 2022. This misconduct is \nwell documented. The record evidence sufficiently establishes that she has engaged in a pattern of \ninappropriate workplace behavior, such as failing to follow instructions, interjecting herself into \nmatters that did not involve her, making threatening or disparaging comments, engaging in \ndisruptive behavior, and exhibiting conduct unbecoming a Federal employee. For example, \nApplicant claimed a commanding officer\u2019s executive assistant had threatened her life in 2013, but \nan ensuing investigation found that Applicant\u2019s allegations were unsubstantiated and \u201cwere \nspecifically repudiated and contradicted by the collective weight of the statements of ten \nwitnesses.\u201d Decision at 4 (quoting AE 1-B at 245). Applicant\u2019s employment history also reveals \nthat she was terminated from a fifth job with a state government, although there is no SOR \nallegation pertaining to that employment. She has repeatedly claimed that corrective or disciplinary \nactions taken by employers were reprisals against her for being a whistleblower; however, she has \nnot shown that any of those claims were substantiated by appropriate investigating authorities. \nParticularly troubling is her use of Government resources to engage in intelligence gathering \nactivities for her unofficial \u201cgray operations,\u201d and her failure to follow official orders related to \nsuch unofficial activities. She mishandled proprietary information while working at Employer \nThree. Her conduct demonstrates that she was unwilling to comply with supervisory instructions, \ndirections, or orders, which raises doubts about her willingness to follow rules, regulations, and \nsupervisory orders regarding the protection of classified or sensitive information. In general, \nApplicant\u2019s misconduct is recent, frequent, and raises security concerns about her trustworthiness, \nreliability, and good judgment. The ultimate burden of persuasion was on Applicant to obtain a \nfavorable clearance decision. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. We agree with the Judge that Applicant failed \nto mitigate the alleged security concerns. In particular, she failed to show that her various types of \nworkplace misconduct are unlikely to recur. \nApplicant failed to establish that the Judge committed any harmful error or that she should \nbe granted any relief on appeal. The Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a \nsatisfactory explanation for the decision. The decision is sustainable on the record. \u201cThe general \nstandard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with national security.\u2019\u201d \nDepartment of the Navy v.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nJason R. Wareham, Esq. \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nDecember 19, 2022, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for \nthat decision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) of the National \nSecurity Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) of Security Executive Agent Directive 4 (effective June 8, \n2017) and DoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). On July 18, 2023, Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals Administrative Judge Robert E. Coacher denied Applicant\u2019s \nsecurity clearance eligibility. Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant was arrested in October 2020 and charged with felony \nassault, misdemeanor assault, false imprisonment, two counts of child abuse, harassment, and \ncriminal mischief. Applicant pled guilty to misdemeanor assault in March 2021 and received a \ndeferred judgment with two years of supervised probation. The Judge found against Applicant on \nthe single allegation. \nOn appeal, Applicant asserts that the Judge failed to properly consider all available \nevidence, rendering his adverse decision arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law, and failed to \nproperly apply the mitigating conditions and Whole-Person Concept. For the reasons set forth \nbelow, we affirm. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nJudge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis \nApplicant, in his mid-forties, was married in 2001 and has three children. He served on \nactive duty in the U.S. military from 2001 through his honorable discharge in 2005. Applicant has \nheld a security clearance for approximately 20 years and has worked for his current defense \ncontractor employer since 2008. \nIn October 2020, one of Applicant\u2019s teenage daughters contacted police to report a \ndomestic violence incident between Applicant and his wife. Officers arrived at the home and \nknocked several times before Applicant answered, at which time the officers explained that they \nwere responding to a reported domestic disturbance and needed to enter the residence because of \nthe nature of the report. Applicant reportedly refused the officers\u2019 entry and told them they needed \na warrant. The officers entered the home despite Applicant\u2019s attempts to keep them out, and he \nfurther resisted being handcuffed. Once inside, the officers went to the basement and found \nApplicant\u2019s wife and daughter locked in a bedroom, the door of which was damaged on the outside \nsuch that it could not be opened from the inside. An officer opened the door and observed \nApplicant\u2019s wife to have a cut lip, swelling on the side of her face, a bruised eye with blood in it, \nand red marks on her neck. The wife reported that she and Applicant had an argument that \nescalated, and she was hit in the head and believed Applicant tried to drag her down the stairs by \nher neck. One daughter reported that her mother told her multiple times that Applicant hit her on \nthe head when she was upstairs. Applicant\u2019s wife and daughter barricaded themselves in the \nbedroom by locking and placing a wooden desk against the door. One daughter corroborated that \nApplicant tried to break down the bedroom door. \nFollowing the incident, Applicant was arrested and charged with the offenses listed in the \nSOR. In March 2021, he pled guilty to one count of misdemeanor assault and received a deferred \njudgment, under which he was placed on supervised probation for two years and ordered to \ncomplete domestic-violence and substance-abuse evaluations and comply with all treatment \nrecommendations from the evaluations. Applicant complied with the evaluations and subsequently \nparticipated in domestic violence and anger management treatment from May 2021 to February \n2022. His treatment provider believed that Applicant was intoxicated during the incident and that \nalcohol contributed to his actions, and she opined that Applicant was at the low-to-medium end of \nthe scale regarding recidivism. Applicant successfully completed all terms of his deferred sentence \nin March 2023 and his record concerning the case was sealed by the court. \nIn a response to Government-issued Interrogatories and in his hearing testimony, Applicant \nprovided a conflicting version of the incident. He expressed that he was cordial and non-resistant \nto the officers and complied with their request to enter the residence. Applicant testified that he \ndid not attempt to break the bedroom door down and that it was damaged weeks before by his \nnephew. He asserted that he had only one glass of champagne that evening and was not drunk. He \nalso claimed he did not strike or strangle his wife. Similarly, Applicant\u2019s wife testified at his \nsecurity clearance hearing and provided conflicting information about the incident, including that \nthe incident was partially her fault because she became intoxicated that evening and threw and \nbroke objects in their home, this was a one-time incident that had not happened before, and she \ndid not believe Applicant assaulted her but was rather trying to deescalate the situation.

While Applicant \n\u201chas made positive strides toward rehabilitation by successfully completing his domestic-violence \nand anger-management therapy,\u201d and \u201c[t]here is no evidence of any subsequent violent behavior \ntowards his family,\u201d the Judge was cautious about the credit to afford Applicant\u2019s subsequent clean \nrecord because he was still under the terms of his probation through March 2023. Decision at 6. \nThe Judge concluded that it was too soon to tell if Applicant \u201cwill continue to abstain from \ndomestic violence incidents without the threat of a probation violation hanging over him,\u201d and \ntherefore his actions continue to cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, and \ngood judgment. Id. at 6, 7. \nDiscussion \nApplicant has not challenged any of the Judge\u2019s specific findings of fact. Rather, he \ncontends that the Judge erred by not considering all the evidence, and by not properly applying the \nmitigating conditions and Whole-Person Concept. \nOral Argument Request \nApplicant requests oral argument before the Appeal Board. The Board\u2019s authority is \nderived from the Directive, which does not authorize the Board to hold oral arguments. See, e.g., \nISCR Case No. 09-01321 at 2 (App. Bd. Feb. 17, 2010). \nConflicting Police Reports and Failure to Apply Mitigating Condition 32(c) \nApplicant primarily challenges the weight that the Judge gave to police reports from the \nincident. For example, Applicant argues that the Judge erred in failing to address contradictions \nbetween the more summary Initial Case Report (Government Exhibit (GE) 2 at 12)) and the more \nrobust Case Supplemental Report (GE 2 at 15-17). Applicant asserts that the former report \u201cthrows \nout blanket assertions that both daughters witnessed [Applicant] strike [his wife] and strangle her \nwith both hands,\u201d which is rebutted by the latter report. Appeal Brief at 14. \nOur review of the evidence reflects only one potential conflict between the two reports. \nSpecifically, the Initial Case Report states that both daughters \u201cwitnessed [Applicant] strike [his \nwife] in the face . . . and strangle her with his hands,\u201d while the Case Supplemental Report states \nthat neither daughter saw the \u201cincident upstairs between [Applicant and his wife].\u201d GE 2 at 12, 16. \nAs an initial matter, these accounts are not obviously conflicting because it is unclear that they \nrefer to the same portion of the incident. The police reports show that Applicant and his wife\u2019s \naltercation continued across multiple floors, some upstairs away from the daughters and some \ndownstairs with the daughters present. Additionally, the record is clear that both daughters \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwitnessed their parents\u2019 fight become physical and that one daughter (D1) even physically \nintervened in the altercation, resulting in her own sustained injury. \nPolice reports, which are admissible both as an official record under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.20 \nand as a public record under Federal Rule of Evidence 803(8), are presumed to be reliable by virtue \nof the government agency\u2019s duty for accuracy and the high probability that it has satisfied that \nduty. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-02859 at 3 (App. Bd. Jun. 23, 2017); ISCR Case No. 16-03603 \nat 4 (App. Bd. May 29, 2019). With respect to the reports contained in GE 2, there are no other \npotential inconsistencies between them to suggest that either lacks credibility. For example, both \nreports reflect that Applicant\u2019s daughters reported the incident to police, Applicant repeatedly \nrefused the police entry into the house and he was subsequently handcuffed, and D1 suffered a \nsmall laceration to her nose from trying to break up the fight between her parents. Id. at 12. The \nCase Supplemental Report provided additional, but not conflicting, details, including that the \ndaughters reported both Applicant and the wife had been drinking that night, and that D1 initially \ndid not check on her parents when she heard loud bangs because it was a fairly regular occurrence \nfor her parents to drink a lot of alcohol when they go out and then get into arguments. Id. at 15-16. \nOfficers observed Applicant to have bloodshot and watery eyes, slurred speech, and difficulty with \nbalance. Officers also observed the wife to have a laceration on her lip, severe swelling to the right \nside of her face, a bruised right eye with blood in it, and red marks on her neck consistent with \nstrangulation. D1 witnessed Applicant restrain the wife from coming down the stairs and later grab \nthe wife\u2019s arms to try and pull her out of a bathroom with increasing aggression. The other daughter \n(D2) witnessed Applicant follow the wife to a bedroom and continue to try and pull her out. After \nlocking him out of the room, D2 heard Applicant attempting to break into the room where she and \nher mother were barricaded, which D1 also heard from her own locked room down the hall. The \nwife told D2 multiple times that Applicant hit her on the head while they were upstairs. Even if \nthe Judge had discounted the Initial Case Report\u2019s account of the daughters witnessing Applicant \nhitting and strangling his wife, none of the facts contained in the Case Supplemental Report, which \nApplicant claims is more accurate, support a case for mitigation. \nApplicant also contends that his and his wife\u2019s consistent hearing testimonies should have \nbeen given greater weight than both police reports. Appeal Brief at 17. Both Applicant and his \nwife testified that Applicant only drank a glass of champagne with dinner that night and he was \nnot intoxicated. Tr. at 45-46, 74-78. The wife disagreed with D1\u2019s report to police that it was a \ncommon occurrence for both Applicant and the wife to drink a lot and get into fights, and asserted \nthat Applicant only ever has two drinks, at most, and never becomes aggressive. Tr. at 40, 47, 49, \n52. Both testified that Applicant was not aggressive that night and the red marks on the wife\u2019s neck \nand cut lip resulted when Applicant tried to restrain her from breaking things and swinging her \narms. Tr. at 36, 48, 52, 75. The wife did not recall how D1 sustained the injury to her nose, how \nshe and D2 came to be barricaded in the bedroom, telling D2 multiple times that Applicant struck \nher on the head, or Applicant trying to break into the room and damaging the door. Tr. at 48-49. \nAlthough the wife claimed to not recall the foregoing details, she affirmatively testified that \nApplicant did not strike or strangle her that night. Tr. at 38, 52. Applicant also testified that he did \nnot strangle his wife, and that the damaged bedroom door was caused by his \u201crambunctious\u201d \nnephew and friends who were visiting several weeks earlier. Tr. at 78, 84. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIt is well-established that \u201c[d]etermining the weight and credibility of the evidence is the \nspecial province of the trier of fact.\u201d Inwood Labs., Inc. v. Ives Labs., Inc., 456 U.S. 844, 856 \n(1982). While the Judge had to consider the foregoing hearing testimony, he was not bound by it. \nIndeed, it would be arbitrary and capricious to uncritically accept witness testimony without \nconsidering whether it is plausible and consistent with other evidence. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n01-07292 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 29, 2004). When conflicts exist within the record, a judge must weigh \nthe evidence and resolve conflicts based upon a careful evaluation of factors such as the evidence\u2019s \n\u201ccomparative reliability, plausibility and ultimate truthfulness.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-06723 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Nov. 14, 2007). Here, when weighed against the observations made by police and \naccounts provided by the daughters as recorded in the contemporaneous police reports, the Judge \nreasonably found Applicant\u2019s and his wife\u2019s testimony lacking credibility. Decision at 3-4. We \nfind no reason not to give deference to the Judge\u2019s negative credibility determination. \nLack of Evidence of Rehabilitation \nApplicant next contends that the Judge \u201cfailed to properly account for, explain, or credit \n[Applicant\u2019s] mitigating conduct,\u201d including that he excelled and fully engaged in treatment and \nhas remained sober. Appeal Brief at 22-23. Contrary to this assertion, the Judge did consider these \nfacts in potential mitigation, but was unable to find them fully mitigating due to the recency of \nApplicant\u2019s probationary status, which ended a month before Applicant\u2019s security clearance \nhearing and has obvious relevance to any analysis of whether his efforts at rehabilitation warrant \napplication of mitigating condition AG \u00b6 32(d). See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 96-0710 at 3 (App. Bd. \nJun. 20, 1997) (Where an applicant engaged in rehabilitative conduct under compulsion of a court \norder, that fact may reduce the mitigating weight of the conduct because a reasonable mind could \nnot conclude that it is really voluntary in nature.). \nThe Judge also declined to apply AG \u00b6 32(d) to the facts of this case because of concerns \nthat Applicant \u201ccontinues to minimize his actions that contributed to the domestic violence charge \nthe night of his arrest,\u201d including by denying assaulting his wife, damaging the door inside the \nhome, and the extent of his alcohol use that night, all despite the wife\u2019s conflicting physical \ninjuries, statements made to the police by the wife and daughters, and observations of responding \nofficers. Decision at 6. An applicant\u2019s unwillingness or inability to accept responsibility for his \nown actions detracts from a finding of reform and rehabilitation. See, e.g., ISCR Case 96-0360 at \n5 (App. Bd. Sep. 25, 1997). Considering the record as a whole, the Judge\u2019s determination that \nApplicant has not demonstrated rehabilitation sufficient to mitigate the Government\u2019s concerns is \nreasonable and sustainable. \nApplicant\u2019s argument in this regard relies on hearing-level decisions in unrelated Guideline \nJ cases to argue that the Judge erred in his analysis of this case. 1 Applicant\u2019s reliance on those \ndecisions is misplaced. The facts and concerns at issue in the cited cases are distinguishable from \nthe instant case. Moreover, how particular fact scenarios were decided at the hearing level in other \ncases is generally not a relevant consideration in the Board\u2019s review of a case. See, e.g., ISCR Case \nNo. 19-02593 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 18, 2021). The decisions that Applicant cites have no direct \nrelationship or unique link to Applicant\u2019s case to make them relevant here. \n1 See Appeal Brief at 23. Applicant cites these cases as Appeal Board decisions; however, they are actually hearing-\nlevel decisions. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplication of Whole-Person Concept \nFinally, Applicant argues that the Judge \u201csummarily ignored much of the evidence and \nanalysis warranted under the whole person concept.\u201d Appeal Brief at 25. The decision reflects that \nthe Judge considered the evidence favorable to Applicant, including five reference letters from \ncoworkers and former coworkers who universally laud Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, work ethic, \nand reliability, and testimony from two witnesses that Applicant is a peaceful person, that they \nhave never seen him abuse alcohol, and that they would trust him holding a security clearance. \nDecision at 4. The Judge found that Applicant made \u201cpositive strides toward rehabilitation by \nsuccessfully completing his domestic-violence and anger-management therapy\u201d and there was \u201cno \nevidence of any subsequent violent behavior towards his family.\u201d Id. at 6. The Judge also \nconsidered Applicant\u2019s military service, including combat deployments. Id. at 7. When weighed \nagainst the nature and seriousness of the incident and Applicant\u2019s continued minimization of his \nactions that night, however, the Judge concluded that the record left questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nApplicant\u2019s arguments regarding the Judge\u2019s application of whole-person factors amounts \nto a disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, which is not sufficient to demonstrate \nthat the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, \ncapricious, or contrary to law. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-07292 at 4. \nBias and Due Process \nApplicant contends that the Judge was \u201cbiased\u201d against him. Appeal Brief at 28. He argues \nthat the Judge \u201cappears to have approached this case with a predetermined narrative\u201d and \n\u201cselectively chose evidence from the record to fit this narrative.\u201d Id. As a related argument, \nApplicant asserts that his due process rights were \u201cunfairly violated by an analysis only working \n[to] inculpate but not exculpate.\u201d Id. at 27. These arguments are not persuasive. Mere \ndissatisfaction with the Judge\u2019s decision does not establish bias. There is a rebuttable presumption \nthat a Judge is impartial and unbiased, and a party seeking to overcome that presumption has a \nheavy burden of persuasion. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 20-03167 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 5, 2023). We \nexamined the entire record and decision, paying particular attention to the transcript of the hearing. \nWe find nothing therein that would cause a reasonable person to question the Judge\u2019s impartiality \nin this case. Applicant has neither rebutted the presumption that the Judge was unbiased nor \nestablished that he was denied any due process afforded him under the Directive. \nConclusion \nApplicant has not established that the Judge committed harmful error. The Judge examined \nthe relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision, and the record \nevidence supports that the Judge\u2019s findings and conclusions are sustainable. \u201cThe general standard \nis that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national \nsecurity.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v.

The Judge found: \nOn December 1, 2022, Applicant voluntarily accepted a plea agreement to \nhave the felony charge reduced to the misdemeanor of harassment. He was \nrepresented by his criminal defense attorney. His plea of guilty was accepted and \nthe court adjudicated his guilt.

    "summary": "Analysis Applicant is in his mid-30s. He earned his bachelor\u2019s degree Summa Cum Laude in 2013 with a major in criminal justice and concentration in forensic investigations. Thereafter, Applicant worked for two years as a police officer with another government agency, where he received three promotions before becoming a DCSA background investigator. In August 2021, in response to a routine re-contact letter, one of four sources that Applicant claimed to have interviewed as part of a background investigation reported that she had never spoken with Applicant. The DCSA OIG initiated an investigation and contacted the source, who reiterated that Applicant never interviewed her, and provided discrepant information from what Applicant had reported of the interview in the ROI. DCSA OIG subsequently contacted the three other sources identified in the ROI to validate their testimonies. All three confirmed with certainty that they were never interviewed by Applicant and, once again, all three provided discrepant information from what Applicant reported of their respective interviews in the ROI.

On June 10, 2022, Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR \nand subsequently submitted a reply. \nOn October 11, 2022, DoD Consolidated Adjudication Services (CAS) revoked \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information, and he appealed that revocation under \nthe provisions of DoDM 5200.02. On December 2, 2022, Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence \n& Security) Ronald Moultrie issued a memorandum requiring that DoD civilian or military \npersonnel whose clearance eligibility was revoked or denied between September 30, 2022, and the \ndate of that memorandum be provided the opportunity to pursue the hearing and appeal process \nset forth in DoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). As a result of Secretary \nMoultrie\u2019s memo, Applicant was given the opportunity to receive the process set forth in the \nDirective, and he elected that process. Hearing Exhibit 1.D. On February 23, 2023, after the \nhearing, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals Administrative Judge Mark Harvey denied \nApplicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.

He earned his bachelor\u2019s degree Summa Cum Laude in 2013 \nwith a major in criminal justice and concentration in forensic investigations. Thereafter, Applicant \nworked for two years as a police officer with another government agency, where he received three \npromotions before becoming a DCSA background investigator. \nIn August 2021, in response to a routine re-contact letter, one of four sources that Applicant \nclaimed to have interviewed as part of a background investigation reported that she had never \nspoken with Applicant. The DCSA OIG initiated an investigation and contacted the source, who \nreiterated that Applicant never interviewed her, and provided discrepant information from what \nApplicant had reported of the interview in the ROI. DCSA OIG subsequently contacted the three \nother sources identified in the ROI to validate their testimonies. All three confirmed with certainty \nthat they were never interviewed by Applicant and, once again, all three provided discrepant \ninformation from what Applicant reported of their respective interviews in the ROI. \nTelephone records for Applicant\u2019s government cell phone did not reflect calls to the four \nsources. He explained that his government phone had poor service at his residence and so he \nreceived authorization to use his personal phone to conduct interviews; however, Applicant \ndecided to use prepaid telephones for the interview calls instead of his personal phone, which made \nit impossible for him to prove that he called the four sources. Applicant also averred that his notes \nfrom the calls, which contained details such as the dates and names of individuals contacted, were \nunavailable, having been destroyed after the ROI was completed. Applicant maintained that the \nsubject ROI accurately reflected what sources told him, and that he complied with investigative \npolicies on the identification of witnesses he interviewed. He suggested that someone may have \nimpersonated the four sources, may have simply agreed with Applicant\u2019s comments to appease \nhim, or may have lied to Applicant, the OIG, or both. \nThe Judge found that Applicant is \u201can intelligent, well trained, and knowledgeable \ninvestigator\u201d who \u201cunderstands the investigative standards for reporting interviews in reports.\u201d \nDecision at 8. He concluded that Applicant \u201cknowingly and intentionally fabricated the interviews \nof [the four sources] in an ROI\u201d and that such fabrication \u201creflects untrustworthy and unreliable \nbehavior, constitutes a pattern of dishonesty, and . . . adversely affects his \u2018personal, professional, \nand community standing.\u2019\u201d Decision at 8. The Judge also found that Applicant\u2019s continued denial \nof fabricating the four interview summaries was not credible, showed a lack of rehabilitation, and \nweighed against mitigation of the personal conduct security concerns. Decision at 9-10. As a result \nof the foregoing, Applicant could not \u201cbe trusted to disclose potentially derogatory security-related \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ninformation about himself that might jeopardize security,\u201d and he \u201cdid not establish his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information.\u201d Decision at 11. \nDiscussion \nOn appeal, Applicant argues that the Judge\u2019s \u201clanguage in the decision . . . incorrectly \nimpl[ies] wrongdoing on [his] part,\u201d and that \u201cthis incorrect implication of wrongdoing resulted in \nunfair prejudice when rendering a decision in this case.\u201d Appeal Brief at 1. Specifically, Applicant \nfirst takes issue with the Judge\u2019s finding that he \u201cdid not make detailed notes of the contents of the \ncalls\u201d and asserts that, to the contrary, he \u201cmaintained notes of the interviews that contained all \nrequired information and they were as detailed as required by DCSA policy.\u201d Appeal Brief at 1. \nApplicant testified at hearing that, per his training, he logged the date and name of the \nindividual contacted; he did not log the time he called or how long the call lasted. Tr. at 31-32. \nThe extent of his description of the substance of his calls was that he: \nwould ask two pages worth of notes, but what would be reported \nwould just be so and so had contact with so and so . . . so many days \nof the week as teacher, neighbor, whatever. And then, if there\u2019s no \nissue[,] information included that would affect that person\u2019s \nclearance, then nothing else gets reported. \nTr. at 38. The Judge\u2019s finding that Applicant \u201cdid not make detailed notes of the content of the \ncalls\u201d constitutes a reasonable inference from the record before him and we find no error in it. \nDecision at 5.  \nApplicant also challenges the Judge\u2019s finding that his \u201cnotes are not available because they \nwere destroyed after the ROI was completed,\u201d and contends that he \u201cdid not personally destroy \nthe notes in [his] case file after the ROI was completed,\u201d but rather \u201cturned [his] case files, \nincluding [his] notes from these interviews, into [his] field office as required by DCSA policy, \nwhere they are maintained by the field office Investigative Assistant and the Special Agent in \nCharge until they are destroyed at a later time by one of those individuals after the case has been \nadjudicated and a required waiting period has passed.\u201d Appeal Brief at 1. However, the Judge\u2019s \nfinding about the notes\u2019 disposition does not indicate, either implicitly or explicitly, that Applicant \nwas responsible for their destruction and consequential unavailability. Once again, we find no error \nin this finding. The Judge\u2019s material findings of security concern are \u201cbased upon substantial \nevidence or constitute reasonable inferences or conclusions that could be drawn from the \nevidence,\u201d and Applicant has cited to no harmful error in the Judge\u2019s findings. See ISCR Case No. \n12-03420 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 25, 2014). \nFinally, Applicant argues that the Judge failed to adequately consider \u201cthat it was the \nDCSA\u2019s decision . . . to have source interviews conducted solely by telephone with no way of \npositively identifying a source being interviewed, and despite having data showing that interviews \nconducted by telephone are at much higher risk of obtaining inaccurate information.\u201d Appeal Brief \nat 1. As an initial matter, the Board is unclear to which \u201cdata\u201d Applicant refers. While he testified \nat length to his opinion that telephonic interviews are inferior to those conducted in-person, we see \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nnothing in the record regarding data to substantiate his opinion. Additionally, this argument \namounts to a disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, which is not sufficient to \ndemonstrate that the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is \narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. See ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, \n2007). \nApplicant has not established that the Judge committed harmful error. The Judge examined \nthe relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision, and the record \nevidence supports that the Judge\u2019s findings and conclusions are sustainable. \u201cThe general standard \nis that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national \nsecurity.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v.

Foreman denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  \nApplicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nFindings of Facts and Conclusions \nApplicant, who is in his 50s, has been employed by DoD agencies since 2015. He served \nin the military and retired in paygrade E-7. He has held a security clearance for many years. He is \ndivorced with three children. He is entitled to receive child support payments from his ex-wife, \nwho is about $60,000 behind on those payments. His current annual salary is about $113,000, and \nhe has a net monthly remainder of about $6,000 to $7,000. Applicant \u201ctestified that he could not \npoint to anything specific that caused him to fall behind on his bills, except that he overextended \nhimself. (Tr. 32) He admitted that some of his debts had \u2018fallen off the radar\u2019 until he was notified \nthat his hearing was being scheduled. (Tr. 46)\u201d Decision at 3.  \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant had eight delinquent debts totaling about $29,600. In late \n2022, Applicant paid two of those debts (Debt # 6 for $194 and Debt #8 for $124). In early 2023, \nhe entered into payment agreements on five of the debts, promised to pay the balances in monthly \nincrements, but did not progress beyond making the initial payments on them.

Applicant failed to demonstrate a track record of \nfinancial responsibility sufficient to mitigate the alleged security concerns. \nDiscussion \nBias and Impartiality \nInterspersed throughout Applicant\u2019s appeal brief is the claim that the Judge was biased \nagainst him. There is a rebuttable presumption that a Judge is impartial and unbiased, and a party \nseeking to overcome that presumption has a heavy burden of persuasion on appeal. See, e. g., ISCR \nCase No. 03-07245 at 3-4 (App. Bd. May 20, 2005). Bias is not demonstrated merely because a \nJudge reached adverse conclusions or found against the appealing party. Moreover, bias is not \ndemonstrated merely because a party can demonstrate a Judge committed a factual or legal error. \nThe standard is not whether a party personally believes a Judge was biased or prejudiced against \nthat party, but rather whether the record of the proceedings below contains any indication that the \nJudge acted in a manner that would lead a reasonable, disinterested person to question the fairness \nand impartiality of the Judge. Id. In this case, Applicant failed to meet his burden of persuasion on \nthis issue.  \nAs a related matter, Applicant also contends that the adverse decision was based on the \nJudge\u2019s \u201cextreme . . . personal opinions versus the actual facts.\u201d Appeal Brief at 1. We find no \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmerit in this argument and, based on our review, conclude the Judge\u2019s decision was a fair and \nreasonable application of the pertinent Guideline F disqualifying and mitigating conditions to the \nfacts in this case. \nWeighing of the Evidence \nIn general, Applicant\u2019s appeal arguments amount to a disagreement with the Judge\u2019s \nweighing of the evidence. For example, Applicant notes that his delinquent debts \u201chappened over \n6 years ago and there is no evidence that there is a frequency nor recurring financial infractions.\u201d \nAppeal Brief at 1. However, an applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of \nconduct and, therefore, can be viewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating \nconditions. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-03146 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 31, 2018). Applicant further \nargues that he could not be compromised due to his financial problems, that there is no evidence \nhe poses a threat to the national interest, and that the security concerns reflected in other \nadjudicative guidelines do not apply to him. To the extent that he is arguing his financial problems \ndo not raise security concerns, we do not find that argument persuasive.  It is well established that \na history of financial problems and an inability to satisfy debts may raise security concerns under \nGuideline F. Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), and 19(c). For example, the Guideline F security \nconcerns encompass the risk that applicants who are financially irresponsible might also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See, \ne.g., ISCR Case No. 16-04112 at 3-4 (App. Bd. May 28, 2019).  \nIn essence, Applicant is arguing for an alternative interpretation of the record evidence. \nThe presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable \nsecurity clearance decision. As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole \nand decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa. A \nparty\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a \ndifferent interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the \nevidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. See, \ne.g., ISCR Case No. 19-01431 at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 31, 2020). In short, we find no error in the \nJudge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant failed to meet his burden to mitigate the security concerns \narising from the alleged debts. \nConclusion \nApplicant failed to establish that the Judge committed any harmful error or that he should \nbe granted an exception under Directive, Encl. 2, App. C. The Judge examined the relevant \nevidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision. The decision is sustainable on \nthe record. \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent \nwith national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nBrittany D. Forrester, Esq. \nOn August 2, 2021, the Department of Defense (DoD) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) \npursuant to DoD Manual 5200.02 (Apr. 3, 2017, as amended) (DoDM 5200.02) advising Applicant \nthat his conduct raised security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines. On December 28, 2021, Applicant submitted a reply. \nOn October 3, 2022, DoD Consolidated Adjudication Services (CAS) revoked Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for access to classified information, and he appealed that revocation under the provisions \nof DoDM 5200.02. On December 2, 2022, Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence & Security) \nRonald Moultrie issued a memorandum requiring that DoD civilian or military personnel whose \nclearance eligibility was revoked or denied between September 30, 2022, and the date of that \nmemorandum be provided the opportunity to pursue the hearing and appeal process set forth in \nDoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAs a result of Secretary Moultrie\u2019s memo, Applicant was given the opportunity to receive \nthe process set forth in the Directive, and he elected that process. Tr. at 7. On March 13, 2023, \nafter a hearing, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals Administrative Judge Mark Harvey \ndenied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 \nE3.1.28 and E3.1.30. He contends that the Judge failed to properly consider all available evidence, \nrendering his adverse decision arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. Consistent with the \nfollowing, we affirm. \nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact: The Judge\u2019s findings are summarized in pertinent part. \nApplicant is in his early sixties and divorced, with two teenaged children. He served in the \nmilitary from 1981 to 2001 and has held a security clearance for about 40 years. He earned a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in a technical area and has received \u201can exceptional amount of information \nsecurity training over several decades.\u201d Decision at 2. \nThe SOR alleges 13 delinquent accounts totaling about $103,000. Applicant testified that \nhis financial problems initially arose from several factors that included his 2012 divorce, child \nsupport obligations, and medical issues in 2018. Id. at 4. Then, beginning in 2017 or 2018, \nApplicant became the victim of an online romance scheme. In a situation involving stolen identity, \nApplicant was led to believe that he was communicating with a female U.S. soldier serving in \nAfghanistan whom he knew as Staff Sergeant (SSG) A. Over a two-to-three-year period, SSG A \nencouraged Applicant to borrow approximately $100,000 and to deposit the funds in bank accounts \nbelonging to her purported relatives. Applicant did so, believing that he and SSG A would live \ntogether upon her return from deployment. When SSG A\u2019s return to the United States was \nrepeatedly delayed, Applicant became suspicious, made inquiries to the military unit, and \nultimately discovered that SSG A did not exist. Applicant acknowledged that he was the victim of \na scam known as \u201ccatfishing.\u201d Id. He was unaware that his funds were being sent to Ghana until \nhe saw the report of investigation for his security clearance. \nIn his April 2021 background interview for his clearance investigation, Applicant stated \nhis intent to file for bankruptcy. Upon his subsequent discovery that he did not qualify for Chapter \n7 bankruptcy, Applicant stated his intent to file under Chapter 13 instead. After losing his federal \nemployment in February 2022, Applicant is again pursuing Chapter 7 bankruptcy. \nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis: The Judge\u2019s analysis is summarized and quoted in pertinent part. \nNone of the mitigating conditions fully apply. Applicant did not provide proof either that \nhe made any payments on the 13 delinquent SOR debts or that he established payment plans. \nAlthough it was \u201cprudent and reasonable\u201d for Applicant to file Chapter 13 bankruptcy in late 2021 \nor early 2022, he did not exercise due diligence in establishing a bankruptcy payment plan. Id. at \n12. Filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in March 2023 was \u201ctoo little too late.\u201d Id. \n[Applicant] indicated most of his delinquent debts were due to him being the victim \nof an Internet scam where SSG A\u2019s identity was used in a scheme over a two-year \nperiod to steal about $100,000 from him. He never talked to SSG A.

Applicant is a 60-year-old expert in information technology with decades of \nexperience. He has security training. SSG A had access to a computer and the \nInternet and was stationed in a major Afghan city, Kabul. Her claims that she was \nunable to call him on the telephone, access her accounts for two years, and was \nunable to return to the United States for two years were transparently false. Her \nsuggested method of transferring funds from Applicant to her by using multiple \naccounts under different names should also have raised a red flag. [Id. at 11.] \n\u201cBeing a victim of a crime is a circumstance beyond an Applicant\u2019s control when an \nApplicant shows reasonable judgment.\u201d Id. (citing ISCR Case No. 14-05803 at 3\u20134 (App. Bd. July \n7, 2016)). The Appeal Board has held that an applicant who is defrauded \u201cby means of a facially \npreposterous real estate scheme cannot fairly claim that [his] debts arose from circumstances \noutside [his] control or that [he] otherwise exhibited sound judgment in the handling of [his] \nfinances.\u201d Id. at 12, quoting ISCR Case No. 14-05803 at 3\u20134. In this case, Applicant did not act \nreasonably or exhibit sound judgment in his payments to SSG A. Id. \nDiscussion \nApplicant has not challenged any of the Judge\u2019s specific findings of fact. Rather, he \ncontends the Judge erred in failing to comply with the provisions in Executive Order 10865 and \nthe Directive by not considering all of the evidence, by mis-weighing the evidence, and by not \nproperly applying the mitigating conditions and whole-person concept. \nMost notably, Applicant argues that the Judge \u201cclearly misweighed [Applicant\u2019s] \ntestimony and reasoning for his involvement in the \u2018catfish\u2019 scam which led to his financial \ndetriment.\u201d Appeal Brief at 6. Applicant contends that the Judge failed to give proper weight to \nthe fact that he was \u201cmisled\u201d in the scam, which resulted in his financial delinquencies. Id. at 15, \n16. Applicant argues that his situation is distinguishable from the cases involving real estate \nschemes, as he \u201cdeveloped a trusting, romantic relationship\u201d with SSG A that did not involve \n\u201ccreative financing\u201d or some other \u201cget rich quick\u201d scheme. Id. at 7. The Judge, however, clearly \narticulated the basis for his conclusion that the online scam was not a mitigating factor. He \nhighlights that\u2014by training and experience\u2014Applicant should have recognized that SSG A\u2019s \nstory was transparently false. Nevertheless, Applicant engaged in an online relationship for \napproximately two years and gave SSG A approximately $100,000 without ever meeting or talking \nto her, raising serious questions about his judgment. The Judge\u2019s determination that these \ncircumstances were not beyond Applicant\u2019s control and that Applicant did not act reasonably is \nwell-supported by the record. \nNone of Applicant\u2019s arguments are enough to rebut the presumption that the Judge \nconsidered all of the record evidence or to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner \nthat was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. Moreover, the Judge complied with the \nrequirements of the Directive in his whole-person analysis by considering all evidence of record \nin reaching his decision.

Edmunds, Esq. \nOn December 21, 2021, the Department of Defense (DoD) issued a statement of reasons \n(SOR) pursuant to DoD Manual 5200.02 (Apr. 3, 2017, as amended) (DoDM 5200.02) advising \nApplicant that his conduct raised security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) \nof the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines.

On December 2, 2022, Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence \n& Security) Ronald Moultrie issued a memorandum requiring that DoD civilian or military \npersonnel whose clearance eligibility was revoked or denied between September 30, 2022, and the \ndate of that memorandum be provided the opportunity to pursue the hearing and appeal process \nset forth in DoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). \nAs a result of Secretary Moultrie\u2019s memo, Applicant was given the opportunity to receive \nthe process set forth in the Directive, and he elected that process. Hearing Exhibit 1D. On March \n6, 2023, after the hearing, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals Administrative Judge Mark \nHarvey denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. Applicant appealed pursuant to \nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nJudge\u2019s Findings and Analysis \nApplicant is in his mid-thirties and has served in the military since 2010. Married and \ndivorced twice, he has three children. His first wife is deceased, and their two children receive \n$800 per month in survivor benefits. His second wife has custody of all three children, and \nApplicant is current on his $1,000 per month child support obligations. \nApplicant and his second wife married in 2015 and accumulated debt while she was in \ngraduate school. After their separation in October 2018, Applicant could not afford the payments \non their debts, and multiple debts became delinquent. \nApplicant\u2019s SOR reflects eight delinquent accounts totaling about $53,200. In his February \n2021 subject interview, Applicant stated that he was not making payments on those debts on advice \nof counsel, in anticipation that some of them would be assigned to his wife in their pending divorce. \nIn the November 2021 divorce, all but one of the marital debts were assigned to Applicant. From \nFebruary 2021 to the present, Applicant made no payments to the SOR creditors. \nIn his February 2022 response to the SOR, Applicant said that he planned to resolve the \ndebts through bankruptcy, and he filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy in November 2022. Applicant \ndelayed filing for bankruptcy because he could not get clear answers on how filing would affect \nhis career and his security clearance. In February 2023, the bankruptcy court confirmed a payment \nplan that includes all of the alleged debts. His bankruptcy records indicate about $160,000 in debt, \nand his monthly payment to the trustee will be $3,000. \nIn August 2021, Applicant borrowed $9,000 from a non-SOR creditor, but stopped making \npayments in March 2022. A $10,000 debt to this creditor is included in his bankruptcy. Applicant \ndeployed to Iraq from October 2021 to May 2022 and saved about $8,000. Applicant has an \noutstanding service record, strong support from military officers, and numerous individual and \ncampaign awards. \nIn the past two years, Applicant did not make any payments on the eight delinquent debts \nalleged on the SOR. Although he borrowed $9,000 from a non-SOR creditor in August 2021 and \nsaved $8,000 during his recent deployment to Iraq, he failed to show how he used these funds to \naddress his SOR debt. \nBased on his track record of debt payments, I am not confident that Applicant will \nmake the required payments under his bankruptcy plan. He did not act responsibly \nunder the circumstances, and he did not make a good-faith effort to pay his debts. \nHis delinquent debts occurred under such circumstances that they are unlikely to \nbe resolved under his bankruptcy plan. His delinquent debts continue to \u201ccast doubt \non [his] current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d and ability to \nprotect classified information.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nChristopher Snowden, Esq. \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nFebruary 15, 2023, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for \nthat decision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement and Substance \nMisuse) of the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) of Security Executive Agent \nDirective 4 (effective June 8, 2017) (SEAD 4) and DoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as \namended) (Directive). On August 8, 2023, after conducting a hearing, Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals Administrative Judge Darlene D. Lokey Anderson denied Applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility. Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. For reasons \nstated below, we remand the Judge\u2019s decision. \nApplicant, who is 26 years old, started his current job in July 2021 and submitted a security \nclearance application (SCA) in May 2022. The SOR alleged that Applicant purchased and used \nvarious illegal drugs, including marijuana from about 2015 to early 2022, cocaine from about 2015 \nto 2021, hallucinogenic mushrooms from about 2016 to 2021, and LSD in about 2017. It also \nalleged that he sold marijuana in about 2017 and purchased and used various prescription \nmedications that were not prescribed to him, including Adderall and Vyvanse from about 2016 to \n2018, Tramadol and Vicodin in about 2017, and Xanax in about 2015. In responding to the SOR, \nApplicant denied the sale-of-marijuana allegation and admitted the other allegations with \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \nclarifications. The Judge found that Applicant knew he was violating state and Federal laws when \nhe used marijuana, cocaine, LSD, and hallucinogenic mushrooms. As a favor to a friend, Applicant \nacted as a middleman in a transaction involving the sale of marijuana in 2017, but he did not \nreceive any money for his participation. Concluding that Applicant failed to demonstrate a \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations, the Judge found against him on each of \nthe SOR allegations. \nOn appeal, Applicant challenges the Judge\u2019s conclusion in her analysis that he continued \nto use marijuana \u201cafter applying for a security clearance, in total disregard of DoD policies and \nFederal law.\u201d Decision at 6. The Judge did not make a finding of fact or cite any evidence \nsupporting that conclusion. The Judge also listed AG \u00b6 25(f), \u201cany illegal drug use while granted \naccess to classified information or holding a sensitive position\u201d as one among other disqualifying \nconditions but did not state that AG \u00b6 25(f) or any other disqualifying conditions specifically \napplied in this case. From our reading of the decision, it is unclear whether the Judge applied AG \n\u00b6 25(f) in this case. \nApplicant testified that he stopped smoking marijuana in March 2022 when he became \naware of its potential security implications and further wanted to change his lifestyle. Tr. 39-41. \nIn his May 2022 SCA, Applicant estimated his most recent use of marijuana was in March 2022 \nand confirmed that information was correct to the best of his recollection during a subsequent \nbackground interview. Government Exhibit (GE) 1 at 74, 88-89 and GE 2 at 16. Based on our \nreview of the record evidence, we are unable to find any evidence supporting a finding or a \nconclusion that Applicant used marijuana after submitting his SCA.  \nIn analyzing this issue, it merits noting that the Appeal Board has \u201clong held that applicants \nwho use marijuana after having been placed on notice of the security significance of such conduct \nmay be lacking in the judgment and reliability expected of those with access to classified \ninformation.\u201d ISCR Case No. 20-01772 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 14, 2021). We have further stated that, \n\u201cafter applying for a security clearance and being adequately placed on notice that such conduct \nwas inconsistent with holding a security clearance, an applicant who continues to use marijuana \ndemonstrates a disregard for security clearance eligibility standards, and such behavior raises \nsubstantial questions about the applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and willingness to comply with \nlaws, rules, and regulations.\u201d ISCR Case No. 21-02534 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 13, 2023). On the other \nhand, it also merits noting that Security Executive Agent (SecEA) Clarifying Guidance Concerning \nMarijuana for Agencies Conducting Adjudications of Persons Proposed for Eligibility for Access \nto Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position, dated December 21, 2021, \nprovides that prior recreational use of marijuana, which of course constitutes a violation of Federal \nlaw, may be relevant in security clearance adjudications but is not determinative. The guidance \nfurther emphasizes the application of the \u201cwhole-person concept\u201d in analyzing such conduct. See \nalso SecEA Adherence to Federal Laws Prohibiting Marijuana Use, dated October 25, 2014. \nConsidering the above pronouncements, we are unable to conclude that the Judge\u2019s error in finding \nthat Applicant used marijuana after submitting SCA did not likely affect the outcome of the case. \nBased on the foregoing, we conclude that the best resolution of this case is to remand the \ncase to the Judge to correct the above-identified harmful error and for further processing consistent \nwith the Directive. Upon remand, a Judge is required to issue a new decision. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.35. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Board retains no jurisdiction over a remanded decision. However, the Judge\u2019s decision issued \nafter remand may be appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.130. Other issues in the \ncase are not ripe for consideration at this time. \nOrder \nThe Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance decision is REMANDED. \nSigned: James F. Duffy \nJames F.

On May 9, 2022, Applicant \nsubmitted a reply. \nOn October 31, 2022, DoD Consolidated Adjudication Services (CAS) revoked \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information, and he appealed that revocation under \nthe provisions of DoDM 5200.02. On December 2, 2022, Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence \n& Security) Ronald Moultrie issued a memorandum requiring that DoD civilian or military \npersonnel whose clearance eligibility was revoked or denied between September 30, 2022, and the \ndate of that memorandum be provided the opportunity to pursue the hearing and appeal process \nset forth in DoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nAs a result of Secretary Moultrie\u2019s memo, Applicant was given the opportunity to receive \nthe process set forth in the Directive, and he elected that process. On March 14, 2023, after close \nof the record, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals Administrative Judge Benjamin R. Dorsey \ndenied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 \nE3.1.28 and E3.1.30. He contends that the Judge failed to properly consider all available evidence \nand misapplied the mitigating conditions, rendering his adverse decision arbitrary, capricious, or \ncontrary to law. Consistent with the following, we remand. \nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact: The Judge\u2019s findings are summarized and quoted in \npertinent part below. \nApplicant is in his late forties. He earned his high school equivalency in the 1990s and \nserved on active duty from 1996 through 2000 and in the Reserve force until 2004. Married since \n1996, Applicant has one daughter in her early twenties. His son died in 2013 at the age of 14. \nApplicant\u2019s wife also served in the military and retired in 2015. \nUnder Guideline G, the SOR alleged the following alcohol-related incidents: a 1994 arrest \nfor Driving While Intoxicated (DWI) that resulted in conviction; a 1996 traffic stop in which \nApplicant\u2019s BAC was under the legal limit; a 1996 arrest for DWI that resulted in conviction; a \n2005 verbal altercation with his wife in military family housing that resulted in a guilty plea to \nPublic Intoxication; a 2008 verbal altercation with his wife in military family housing that resulted \nin Applicant\u2019s arrest for assault against a police officer and resisting a police officer but no \nconvictions; a 2014 arrest for DWI that resulted in conviction; and a May 2019 arrest for DWI that \nresulted in a suspended sentence of one year jail time, a fine, a class for repeat offenders, and two \nyears of community supervision, which ended in April 2023. In addition to these incidents, the \nSOR also alleged that Applicant attended a substance abuse course after his 2014 arrest for DWI \nand it alleged his history of alcohol consumption as related by him during his 2017 security \nclearance interview. Under Guideline J, all the alcohol-related incidents were cross-alleged, with \nthe exception of the 1996 traffic stop that did not result in conviction.  \nAlthough Applicant attended Alcoholics Anonymous meetings for about 18 months \nfollowing his 1994 DWI, he did not attend meetings or alcohol-related counseling from 1996 \nthrough 2014. After his 2014 DWI, Applicant attended a brief court-ordered counseling. He \ntestified that he was diagnosed as having an alcohol abuse disorder and cautioned to monitor his \nalcohol consumption, but that he was not told to abstain. Applicant did not attend any alcohol-\nrelated counseling between 2015 and 2020. \nIn February 2020, Applicant attended in-patient alcohol counseling for a \nweek at a recovery center. During this in-patient treatment, he was again diagnosed \nwith an alcohol use disorder and was advised to abstain from alcohol. After his in\u00ad\npatient counseling, he attended about four out-patient substance abuse and \nbehavioral counseling sessions until about June 2020. In March 2022, he began \nattending out-patient counseling sessions with a licensed substance abuse counselor \n(SA counselor). He initially attended these sessions once a week, but based on his \nprogress, he began attending them bi-weekly. His SA counselor notes that he is \nmaking progress with PTSD [Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder] and alcohol abuse. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \nShe diagnosed him as having \u201calcohol abuse disorder-in remission\u201d and stated he \nis working on abstaining from alcohol consumption. [Decision at 5\u20136.] \nApplicant consumed two alcoholic beverages in the year prior to the hearing\u2014a shot of \nalcohol on his son\u2019s birthday in March 2022 and a glass of wine with Thanksgiving dinner in \nNovember 2022. In April 2022, his spouse acknowledged that Applicant had modified his alcohol \nconsumption. In May 2022, Applicant asserted that he would never drink and drive again, that he \nwould modify his alcohol consumption, and that if he drinks in the future, he will do so responsibly. \nAt the hearing, he stated that he \u201cdoesn\u2019t really drink anymore\u201d and that he decided to stop drinking \nafter November 2022 because he does not miss it. Id. at 6. Applicant acknowledged that, according \nto his understanding of the principles of AA, the two drinks in 2022 are considered relapses. Id. \nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis: The Judge\u2019s analysis is quoted below in pertinent part. \nGuideline G \nApplicant has four DWI convictions. He engaged in multiple verbal \naltercations with his spouse while he was drinking that involved the police or MPs.  \nOn one of those occasions, he had a physical altercation with police. He was \ndiagnosed with an alcohol use disorder. In 2020, while he was receiving inpatient \nalcohol counseling, he was told that he should abstain from alcohol consumption. \nAs evidenced by the two drinks he has consumed in 2022 and his spouse\u2019s March \n2022 statement that he drinks in a responsible manner, he has not followed that \ntreatment recommendation. [AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a), (d), (e), and (f)] are established.1 \n. \n. \n. \nApplicant had a pattern of alcohol-related incidents that lasted over 20 years. \nGiven the number of convictions for DWI and verbal or physical altercations where \nalcohol was involved, he has not shown that his behavior is infrequent or happened \nunder unusual circumstances. His last DWI occurred recently enough that he is still \non probation. Despite his many problems with alcohol, he consumed it as recently \nas November 2022. . . . AG \u00b6 23(a) does not apply.2 \nWhile Applicant has taken steps to acknowledge and correct his problem \nwith alcohol, he consumed alcohol as recently as November 2022, well after it was \nrecommended that he abstain. He has not provided sufficient evidence of a clear \n1 AG \u00b6 22(a), alcohol-related incidents away from work; AG \u00b6 22(d), diagnosis of alcohol use disorder by duly \nqualified professional; AG \u00b6 22(e), the failure to follow treatment advice once diagnosed; and AG \u00b6 22(f), alcohol \nconsumption, which is not in accordance with treatment recommendations after a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder. \n2 AG \u00b6 23(a), so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it happened under such unusual \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \nand established pattern of abstinence. AG \u00b6 23(b) does not apply.3 \nApplicant provided evidence that he is participating in alcohol and \nbehavioral therapy and making satisfactory progress. However, in 2020, while \nattending inpatient counseling, he was told that he should abstain from alcohol. He \nhas not abstained from alcohol and therefore has a history of relapse. AG \u00b6 23(c) \ndoes not apply.4 \nApplicant provided evidence that he successfully completed an alcohol \ntreatment program in 2020. However, as he has not abstained from consuming \nalcohol, he has not demonstrated a clear and established pattern of abstinence in \naccordance with the treatment program\u2019s treatment recommendations. AG \u00b6 23(d) \ndoes not apply.5 [Decision at 8\u20139.] \nGuideline J \nApplicant had a pattern of DWI offenses that has extended for over 20 years. \nHe has been convicted of four DWIs. He is still on probation for his last DWI in \n2019. Despite a 2020 treatment recommendation that he should abstain from \nalcohol, he has not shown that he is able to do so for any extended period of time. \nGiven these considerations, I cannot find that he has shown that his criminal \nbehavior happened under unusual circumstances or that it is unlikely to recur. \n[Decision at 10.] \nDiscussion \nIn deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are erroneous, we will review the \ndecision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a \nsatisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts \nfound and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of \njudgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the \ndecision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed \nto a mere difference of opinion.

State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co., 463 U.S. \n29, 43 (1983)). \n3 AG \u00b6 23(b), the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol use, provides evidence of actions \ntaken to overcome this problem, and has demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations. \n4 AG \u00b6 23(c), the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has no previous history of treatment \nand relapse, and is making satisfactory progress in a treatment program. \n5 AG \u00b6 23(d), the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along with any required aftercare, and \nhas demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOn appeal, the gravamen of Applicant\u2019s argument is that the Judge made improper findings \nregarding Applicant\u2019s failure to follow treatment recommendations and that he relied upon those \nimproper findings in applying the mitigating conditions, rendering his decision arbitrary and \ncapricious. We agree. The Judge\u2019s repeated adverse determinations regarding Applicant\u2019s \ndiagnoses, treatment recommendations, and failure to follow treatment recommendations raise two \nclosely-related issues. These matters were not alleged in the SOR, raising due-process concerns, \nand the Judge failed to explain a satisfactory explanation for his conclusions given the ambiguous \nstate of the evidence. \nThe SOR does not allege either a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder or a failure to follow \ntreatment recommendations. Instead, the SOR under Guideline G alleges Applicant\u2019s numerous \nalcohol-related incidents, his drinking history as reported by him to the background investigator, \nand the fact that Applicant attended a substance abuse class following his 2014 DWI. \nIn arriving at his findings regarding diagnoses, treatment recommendations, and \nApplicant\u2019s purported failure to follow those recommendations, the Judge appears to rely on the \nfollowing testimony elicited during Department Counsel\u2019s cross-examination of Applicant: \nDC: And what were your takeaways from that three-day course [in April \n2015 following conviction for the 2014 DWI]? Did . . . anyone sit down with you \nand examine your record of alcohol abuse and come to a recommendation for you? \nAPP: To the best of my knowledge, I believe so. I want to say that they \nfound that I was alcohol abusive, and . . . basically told me to watch the amount of \nalcohol I consumed. \nDC: So . . . what they identified you as is alcohol abusive? Was that a \nprognosis (sic) of alcohol abuse disorder? \nAPP: I don\u2019t know. \n[Tr. at 79.] \n. \n. \n. \nDC: [Regarding Applicant\u2019s 2020 inpatient treatment] Do you recall if there \nwas a diagnosis of what your issues may be [when you checked in]? \nAPP: Well, they don\u2019t really diagnose you at the beginning because they \ndon\u2019t . . . know enough about you. At conclusion, that was when they diagnosed \nme with post-traumatic stress as well as alcohol abuse. \nDC: So they confirmed the alcohol abuse disorder that was first diagnosed \nformally when you were in treatment in April of 2015. Is that correct? \nAPP: Yes. \n5 \n\n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDC: And when you left there at the end of your seven-day stay, what was \ntheir recommendation and professional advice to you with regard to future \ndrinking? \nAPP: Pretty much to abstain. \nDC: Okay. \nAPP: Well, I believe that\u2019s correct. I\u2019m not a hundred percent on that. I\u2019d \nhave to look at the paperwork they issued to . . . be exactly sure. [Id. at 87\u201388.] \nApplicant also testified that his current SA counselor has not recommended abstinence, \nthat he reported his two drinks in 2022 to her, and that she cautioned him to \u201cbe careful with \ndrinking anything.\u201d Id. at 91\u201392. The SA counselor submitted a letter on Applicant\u2019s behalf in \nwhich she referenced his current diagnoses of Alcohol Use Disorder in Remission and PTSD and \ncited his \u201csignificant progress.\u201d AE K.  \nThe Judge appears to have concluded that Applicant\u2019s testimony alone established AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n22(d), (e), and (f)\u2014i.e., that Applicant was diagnosed with alcohol use disorder in 2015 and 2020, \nthat he failed to follow treatment advice once diagnosed, and that he consumed alcohol in violation \nof treatment recommendations after a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder. Decision at 7\u20138. In \nrendering his unfavorable clearance decision, the Judge relied heavily on his conclusion that \nApplicant drank alcohol in violation of treatment recommendations, citing that fact as dispositive \nin his analysis of three of the four mitigating conditions under Guideline G and again as a factor \nin his analysis under Guideline J. Id. at 9, 10. \nWe note that it was Applicant who introduced the subject of his 2020 inpatient treatment \nin his SOR response. Although a failure to follow treatment recommendations was not alleged in \nthe SOR, it was not necessarily improper for the Judge to have considered a failure to adhere to \nthe treatment recommendations from that program, insofar as non-alleged conduct can be relevant \non, inter alia, issues of mitigation, rehabilitation, and the whole-person analysis. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 15-07369 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 16, 2017). However, our review of the decision and of the \nrecord as a whole persuades us that the Judge did not consider this evidence in its proper context. \nCf. ISCR Case No. 17-01193 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 22, 2019). \nFirst, the Judge erred in that he failed to explain how he reached his conclusion that \nApplicant was advised to abstain from alcohol and that he consumed it in violation of that \nrecommendation, given the equivocal nature of Applicant\u2019s testimony, the lack of any medical \nrecords or evaluations substantiating that recommendation, and the current counselor\u2019s diagnosis \nof alcohol use disorder in remission. The Judge did not recognize and resolve the obvious \nambiguities, but instead simply stated his finding in a conclusory manner. Second, the Judge erred \nin that he did not consider the purported failure to follow treatment recommendations for limited \npurposes, as permitted, but instead repeatedly cited Applicant\u2019s failure to abstain as the \ndeterminative factor in his analysis.

Jun. 17, 2016). Based on our review of the \nJudge\u2019s decision, we conclude that his heavy reliance on AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(e) and (f)\u2014Applicant\u2019s \nnoncompliance with purported treatment recommendations\u2014violated Applicant\u2019s due process \nrights under the Directive. In the absence of an amendment to the SOR, an Administrative Judge \ncannot find against an applicant based on a matter not encompassed by the SOR. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 99-0500 at 3 (App. Bd. May 19, 2000). \nConclusion \nThe errors identified above warrant a remand. Directive \u00b6 4.3 provides that an unfavorable \nclearance decision shall not be made without first providing an applicant with notice of the specific \nreasons for the proposed action and an opportunity to respond to those reasons. In this case, the \nSOR alleged that Applicant attended alcohol treatment. This consisted of a DWI education course \nfollowing his first DWI conviction in 1995 and a group education class following his third DWI \nconviction in 2015. The SOR makes no reference to Applicant being diagnosed with an alcohol \nuse disorder, a failure to follow advice once diagnosed, or alcohol consumption not in with \naccordance treatment recommendations. The Judge applied disqualifying conditions, AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(d), \n(e), and (f), when there are no SOR allegations that fairly raise those security concerns. A fair \nreading of the Judge\u2019s decision shows that it is based significantly on unalleged conduct and \ncircumstances. Such a due process violation is not harmless error. Although the Judge did not \nexplicitly make a credibility determination regarding Applicant, his findings implicitly call \nApplicant\u2019s credibility into question. This would cause a reasonable person to question the \nimpartiality of the Judge on remand. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-03974 at 6 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, \n2006). Given these circumstances, we conclude that the best resolution is to remand this case to a \ndifferent judge for a new hearing. Under Directive E3.1.35, the Judge assigned the case is required \nto issue a new clearance decision. The Board retains no jurisdiction over a remanded decision. \nHowever, the Judge\u2019s decision issued after remand may be appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 \nE3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nOrder \nThe decision is REMANDED. \nSigned: James F.

The Majority Opinion identifies no harmful error, and \nits chosen remedy serves no valid juridical purpose. I respectfully dissent. \nRemand is Unnecessary \nAs an initial matter, I disagree that remand is appropriate in this case. The majority \nconcludes that the Judge\u2019s handling of the Guideline G concern was arbitrary and capricious for \ntwo reasons. First, they find that he failed to satisfactorily explain his conclusions regarding \nApplicant\u2019s diagnosis and failure to follow treatment recommendations \u201cgiven the ambiguous state \nof the evidence.\u201d Majority Opinion at 5. The majority also fault the Judge\u2019s analysis of these two \nthings under the disqualifying conditions because the \u201cSOR does not allege either a diagnosis of \nalcohol use disorder or a failure to follow treatment recommendations.\u201d Id. \nI agree that it would have been preferable for the Judge to explain how he reconciled \nambiguities in the record regarding Applicant\u2019s diagnosis and treatment recommendations. I do \nnot agree, however, that either his failure to do so or his application of disqualifying conditions \n22(d), (e), and (f) constitutes harmful error. \nAnalysis of Diagnosis and Treatment Recommendations Not Error \nThe majority finds that Applicant was denied due process because the Judge analyzed \nApplicant\u2019s diagnosis and failure to follow treatment recommendations under the Guideline G \ndisqualifying conditions, even though the SOR alleged neither concern explicitly. \nGenerally, a judge is \u201cprecluded from raising security concerns outside the scope of the \nSOR . . . and conduct not alleged or otherwise fairly embraced by the SOR\u201d may only be \nconsidered for limited purposes, including evaluating an applicant\u2019s credibility, rehabilitation, or \ncase in mitigation. ISCR Case No. 14-03475 at 3 (App. Bd. Jun. 15, 2016) (emphasis added). \nThe purpose of an SOR is to put an applicant on notice of the Government\u2019s security \nconcerns and to enable him to present his case for mitigation. ISCR Case No. 12-01266 at 3 (App. \nBd. Apr. 4, 2014). It is an administrative pleading and should not be held to the \u201cstrict requirements \nof a criminal indictment.\u201d ISCR Case No. 00-0430 at 6 n.3 (App. Bd. Jul. 3, 2001). Variances \nbetween an SOR allegation and a judge\u2019s findings and conclusions are expected, and they are \nmaterial only when so great that the SOR fails to provide an applicant with reasonable notice of \nthe concerns against him, thereby subjecting him to unfair surprise at hearing. See ISCR Case No. \n12-01266 at 3. As long as an applicant receives reasonable notice about the matters at issue in his \ncase and has a meaningful opportunity to respond, a security clearance case should be decided on \nthe merits of the relevant issues and should not be overly concerned with pleading niceties. See, \ne.g., ISCR Case No. 99-0710 at 2 (App. Bd. Mar. 19, 2001). \nApplicant\u2019s February 2020 alcohol treatment, which was initiated in response to his 2019 \narrest for Driving While Intoxicated (DWI), was fairly embraced by the SOR\u2019s Guideline G \nallegations concerning the 2019 DWI and Applicant\u2019s 25-year history of other alcohol-related \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nincidents. Applicant himself appears to have understood that the 2020 treatment was encompassed \nby the SOR as he alerted the Government to this information in his SOR response. See SOR \nResponse at 5-6, 8, 12. Applicant also raised the subject of his 2020 alcohol treatment first at \nhearing, during his direct examination. See Tr. at 60-61. Therefore, Applicant\u2019s 2020 alcohol \ntreatment and all that flowed from it cannot plausibly have caused him unfair surprise. \nMoreover, even though the subject matter was not formally added to the SOR, Applicant \nrequested and was granted an opportunity to specifically obtain and present treatment records, \nwhich certainly could have included \u201cthe paperwork they issued to [him],\u201d as referenced during \nquestioning about the treating provider\u2019s recommendations. See Tr. at 9, 63-64, 87-88; SOR \nResponse at 8, 19. Therefore, the purpose of a notice requirement \u2013 to afford an individual an \nopportunity to prepare and respond \u2013 was satisfied in this case, and Applicant suffered no \nprejudice. \nThe majority insists that any conduct not explicitly alleged in the SOR may be used for \nonly limited purposes, even if the conduct fell under the same adjudicative concern and even if the \napplicant had a meaningful opportunity to address the conduct prior to the close of the record. This \nstrict position is difficult to reconcile with prior pronouncements that an SOR, an administrative \npleading, should not be held to the same rigid standards as a criminal indictment or overly \nconcerned with pleading niceties. Exploration of the evolution of this policy would require more \nin-depth analysis, to include examining whether a judge is precluded from considering only new \nadjudicative concerns (i.e., Guidelines) or from considering any conduct not explicitly alleged \nunder those concerns, and what conduct is \u201cfairly embraced\u201d or \u201cencompassed\u201d by, but not \nexplicitly stated in an SOR. This is ultimately unnecessary at this time, however, because the \nJudge\u2019s decision in this matter is sustainable on other grounds. \nDenial is Sustainable on Other Grounds \nRemand in this case is also unnecessary because the Judge\u2019s ultimate adverse decision was \nbased on other, sustainable grounds beyond the Guideline G analysis with which the majority takes \nissue, rendering that purported error harmless. \nAn error is harmless, and remand is therefore inappropriate, \u201cwhen a clearance denial is \nbased on multiple security concerns, some of which are sustainable and not affected by the error.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007).6 Here, the SOR cross-alleged the following \nsummarized concerns under Guidelines G and J, all of which the Judge found adversely: Applicant \nwas charged with DWI in 1994, 1996, 2014, and 2019; he remained on probation for the 2019 \nDWI at the time of the hearing; military police responded to Applicant\u2019s residence in 2005 due to \nreports of domestic dispute and observed him to have a strong odor of alcohol; and military police \n6 See also, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-11181 at 2 (App. Bd.

If remand were warranted, \nthe matter should be returned to the original Judge to correct the purported errors. \nThe majority concludes sua sponte that reassignment is necessary because, \u201c[a]lthough the \nJudge did not explicitly make a credibility determination regarding Applicant, his findings \nimplicitly call Applicant\u2019s credibility into question.\u201d Majority Opinion at 7. In reaching this \nconclusion, the majority points to no specific portion of the Judge\u2019s decision, but it appears they \nare relying on the Judge\u2019s discussion reconciling conflicting evidence of the events precipitating \nthe 2019 DWI, as presented in Applicant\u2019s version and the police report. Decision at 5.7 \nReassignment of a case on remand is appropriate only when the lower court judge\u2019s \nconduct is \u201cso extreme as to display clear inability to render fair judgment\u2019\u201d Liteky v.

This \n7 The Judge made the following findings: \n\u201cThe result of the blood test was that [Applicant] had a .141% BAC. Applicant claimed that he was \nnot intoxicated when he drove to the crash scene. He claimed that, as he was hot, he drank two 12\u00ad\nounce beers between about 10:30 a.m. and 11:00 a.m. while waiting for the police to complete their \ncrash investigation. . . . He claimed that he was not intoxicated until after he had the two beers late \nthat morning, but also acknowledged that he must have been intoxicated before that, but he did not \n\u2018feel it.\u2019 The police report does not reference him drinking these two beers and it reflects that his \nspouse did not believe he drank these two beers. \nApplicant was over the legal limit of .08 BAC. I find it highly unlikely that the two beers he drank \nover two hours before his blood draw cause his BAC to go over the legal limit of .08 BAC.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nChristopher Snowden, Esq. \nOn February 1, 2022, the Department of Defense (DoD) issued a statement of reasons \n(SOR) pursuant to DoD Manual 5200.02 (Apr. 3, 2017, as amended) (DoDM 5200.02) advising \nApplicant that his conduct raised security concerns under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption) and \nGuideline J (Criminal Conduct) of the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) in \nAppendix A of Security Executive Agent Directive 4 (effective June 8, 2017). \nOn October 31, 2022, DoD Consolidated Adjudication Services (CAS) revoked \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information, and he appealed that revocation under \nthe provisions of DoDM 5200.02. On December 2, 2022, Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence \n& Security) Ronald Moultrie issued a memorandum requiring that DoD civilian or military \npersonnel whose clearance eligibility was revoked or denied between September 30, 2022, and the \ndate of that memorandum be provided the opportunity to pursue the hearing and appeal process \nset forth in DoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). As a result of Secretary \nMoultrie\u2019s memo, Applicant was given the opportunity to receive the process set forth in the \nDirective, and he elected that process. On March 14, 2023, Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals Administrative Judge Benjamin R. Dorsey denied Applicant\u2019s request for security \nclearance eligibility. Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOn his initial appeal, Applicant contended that the Judge failed to properly consider all \navailable evidence and misapplied the mitigating conditions, rendering his adverse decision \narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. On May 31, 2023, the Appeal Board determined that the \nrecord raised due process concerns and remanded the decision for assignment to a different judge \nand for a new hearing. On July 14, 2023, Administrative Judge Edward W. Loughran again denied \nApplicant\u2019s request for security clearance eligibility and Applicant appealed that decision. \nNow on his second appeal, Applicant asserts that the Judge failed to properly consider all \navailable evidence, rendering his adverse decision arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law, and \nfailed to properly apply the mitigating conditions and whole-person analysis. Consistent with the \nfollowing, we affirm. \nJudge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis \nApplicant, in his late forties, served on active duty in the U.S. military from 1996 through \nhis honorable discharge in 2000, and served for the next four years in the Reserve force. He married \nhis wife during his military service, but they recently separated. They have one adult daughter and \nlost their son to suicide in 2013. Applicant has been a civilian employee of the military since 2016. \nUnder Guidelines G and J, the SOR alleged concerns arising from the following conduct. \nIn 1994, Applicant was arrested for driving while intoxicated (DWI) after consuming between two \nand eight drinks. He pled guilty and was sentenced to 180 days of probation, and subsequently \nattended Alcoholics Anonymous for a period and abstained from alcohol for over a year. \nIn March 1996, Applicant was arrested for suspicion of DWI after consuming about three \ndrinks; however, his blood alcohol concentration (BAC) was below the legal limit and he was not \ncharged. Later that same year, Applicant was arrested for DWI after drinking and driving following \na Fourth of July barbeque. He informed his command about the July 1996 arrest and believed the \nmilitary coordinated his punishment with the state. Applicant later learned this was incorrect and \nrealized in about 2003 that he had an outstanding warrant. He pled nolo contendere to the DWI \ncharge and was sentenced to three days in jail and 90 days\u2019 suspended license. \nOn Thanksgiving 2005, Applicant\u2019s wife contacted military police (MP) and reported a \nverbal altercation with Applicant over his having pointed a rifle at his head in front of their seven\u00ad\nyear-old son the prior week. The son reported that Applicant asked him if he would like to see \nApplicant blow his brains out, then retrieved a rifle from the closet, loaded it, and pointed it at \nApplicant\u2019s own head. The MPs noted a strong odor of alcohol coming from Applicant, who \ncorroborated his son\u2019s story. Applicant was arrested for disorderly conduct, to which he later pled \nguilty. At his security clearance hearing, he denied loading or pointing the shotgun at his head. \nIn December 2008, Applicant\u2019s wife again contacted the MPs to report a domestic \ndisturbance after she overheard Applicant express that he was going to end her career and she \nresponded by locking herself and the children in a bedroom. Applicant became angry and beat on \nthe door, causing minor damage. The MPs reported that Applicant appeared to be extremely \nintoxicated. He refused to comply with their directions, pushed one officer, resisted apprehension, \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand was subsequently pepper-sprayed, which made him more aggressive and combative. Applicant \nwas transported to the hospital for treatment and issued citations for battery on a peace officer, \nresisting arrest, and assault against a peace officer, which were later dismissed. At his security \nclearance hearing, Applicant denied becoming physical during the incident, and asserted that the \nMPs tackled, kicked, and beat him without provocation. He believes the charges were dismissed \nbecause of the injuries he sustained from the MPs. \nIn November 2014, Applicant was again arrested for DWI (BAC .15%) and open container. \nHe pled guilty to the former charge and was sentenced to twelve months of probation and \ncompletion of an alcohol assessment and treatment, which he attended for five days in April 2015 \nand consisted of group education about drinking and driving. \nOn a morning in May 2019, Applicant\u2019s wife crashed her car into a fence after swerving to \navoid hitting a deer. She walked a few miles home to inform Applicant, who had been drinking \nthe night before. Applicant drove his truck with his wife to the scene of the accident, stating that \nhe planned to repair the fence to prevent any livestock from entering the road. He also stated that \nhe packed some beer in a cooler to drink while he repaired the fence. Deputies were already at the \nscene when Applicant and his wife returned, and state highway patrol officers arrived later. An \nofficer reported a strong odor of alcohol from Applicant, who informed the officer that he had \nabout nine or ten beers the night before. Applicant initially participated in a field sobriety test, but \nstopped partway through, and later refused breathalyzer and blood tests. He was arrested and \ntransported to a hospital, where his blood was drawn pursuant to a warrant and his BAC was \n.141%. Applicant was charged with DWI (3rd or more), a felony. In April 2021, he pled nolo \ncontendere to DWI (2nd), a misdemeanor, and was sentenced to two years of probation. He later \ntestified that he accepted the plea because security personnel informed him that a felony conviction \nwould affect his security clearance, while a misdemeanor conviction likely would not. \nAt his security clearance hearing, Applicant expressed that he waited at the scene of the \naccident for about two and a half hours and passed the time by drinking two of the beers he brought. \nApplicant later moved his truck at the request of law enforcement and, when he walked back to \nthe scene, the officer requested to conduct a field sobriety test. Applicant believed that the request \nto move his truck was a set-up so the investigator could have evidence of Applicant driving, and \nhe refused to consent to any of the procedures until the court ordered a blood test. Contrary to \nApplicant\u2019s recollection, the police report stated neither that Applicant drank at the scene nor that \nhe moved his truck. Regarding this conflicting evidence, the Judge found that Applicant\u2019s account \nwas not credible, and that the police report was the more accurate description of what occurred. \nApplicant received inpatient alcohol treatment for seven days in February 2020 and had \nreceived outpatient treatment since April 2022. He was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress \ndisorder and alcohol use disorder, in remission. Applicant drank a shot in March 2022 for his late \nson\u2019s birthday and a glass of wine in November 2022 for Thanksgiving but has otherwise abstained \nfrom alcohol since 2020. Applicant testified that he is committed to remaining sober and his \ntherapist reported that Applicant has made significant progress in his treatment goals related to his \ngrieving process and alcohol abuse. Applicant submitted numerous documents attesting to his \nexcellent job performance and strong moral character, and the Judge noted that Applicant is \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\u201cpraised for his trustworthiness, dependability, work ethic, leadership, professionalism, expertise, \ndedication, and loyalty to the United States.\u201d Decision at 8. \nThe Judge found that Applicant\u2019s \u201c[f]our DWI convictions are not to be taken lightly, and \n[did] not accept [Applicant\u2019s] versions of some of the incidents.\u201d Id. at 10. While \u201cApplicant may \nsomeday reach the point where he can mitigate alcohol consumption security concerns, . . . it will \ntake full acceptance of responsibility for his conduct, complete candor, and a longer period without \nmisconduct.\u201d Id. The Judge concluded that Applicant\u2019s alcohol use and criminal conduct continue \nto cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment, and the mitigating conditions, \neither individually or collectively, are insufficient to alleviate those concerns. Id. at 10, 11. \nDiscussion \nOn his second appeal, Applicant contends that the Judge erred in failing to comply with \nthe provisions in Executive Order 10865 and the Directive by not considering all the evidence, by \napplying facts that were not supported by the record evidence, and by not properly applying the \nmitigating conditions and Whole-Person Concept. \nChallenge to Findings of Fact \nApplicant first asserts that \u201cseveral of the Administrative Judge\u2019s factual findings are \nwholly unsupported by the record.\u201d Appeal Brief at 10. As we have explained before, there is a \ndifference between errors in a judge\u2019s findings of fact and errors in the conclusions drawn \ntherefrom. See ISCR Case No. 22-00822 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 5, 2023). Findings of fact must be \nsupported by substantial evidence, while conclusions are reasonable inferences drawn from the \nevidence. See ISCR Case No. 18-00496 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 8, 2019), citing Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.32.1 \nand E3.1.32.3. Applicant\u2019s purported factual errors are simply challenges to the Judge\u2019s weighing \nof the evidence and are therefore addressed along with his other arguments. \nChallenge to Judge\u2019s Credibility Determination \nApplicant challenges the Judge\u2019s resolution of conflicting evidence regarding the 2019 \nDWI arrest, namely the Judge\u2019s determination that Applicant\u2019s account of the incident was not \ncredible and that the police report was the more accurate description of what occurred. Appeal \nBrief at 10-12.1 As set forth below, Applicant\u2019s challenge is unpersuasive. \nApplicant first argues that \u201cin deciding to resolve the apparent conflict in favor of the police \nreport, the Administrative Judge does not address a statement signed by [Applicant] four days after \nthe incident which is exactly the same as [Applicant\u2019s] testimony at two administrative hearings.\u201d \nAppeal Brief at 11.2 Applicant\u2019s focus on this statement as the basis for any assignment of error is \n1 Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1 provides that \u201cthe Appeal Board shall give deference to the credibility determinations of the \nAdministrative Judge.\u201d With respect to this conflicting evidence, we note that the Judge on remand, without having \nreviewed the original decision, reached the same unfavorable conclusion about the credibility of Applicant\u2019s account \nof the 2019 incident. \n2 In support of this statement, Applicant points to a statement entered into the record as Government Exhibit (GE) 9; \nhowever, the statement actually appears at GE 10. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nmisplaced for several reasons, not the least of which is that there is a rebuttable presumption that \nthe Judge considered all of the record evidence, and that presumption is not rebutted merely \nbecause the appealing party can point to information in the record that was not mentioned in the \nJudge\u2019s decision. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-09781 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 25, 2002). \nAdditionally, Applicant\u2019s counsel asserts that this statement was \u201csigned by [Applicant] \nfour days after the incident.\u201d Appeal Brief at 11. We interpret counsel\u2019s inclusion of this assertion \nas an attempt to show that the close temporal proximity between the event and the statement lends \nto the latter\u2019s credibility; however, counsel\u2019s assertion is inaccurate. The incident occurred on the \nmorning of May 11, 2019, and Applicant signed the referenced statement on May 15, 2020 \u2013 one \nyear and four days after the incident. GE 10 at 4-5. It bears noting that, from our examination of \nthis evidence, Applicant did not self-report his 2019 arrest to his security officer. Rather, the 2019 \narrest was identified in March 2020 as part of the Continuous Evaluation Program, following \nwhich DoD issued Applicant a Request for Further Information (RFI)3 in April 2020, and he \nthereafter responded with the referenced statement. GE 6; GE 10 at 5. The timing and involuntary \nnature of Applicant\u2019s disclosure weigh against his overall candor about the incident. \nApplicant\u2019s claim that his statement is \u201cexactly the same\u201d as his testimony across two \nadministrative hearings is also inaccurate. In the statement, Applicant details the events of the \nmorning, beginning when his wife arrived home, through his arrest. Applicant asserted in the \nstatement that he \u201chad brought a couple of beers with [him] to drink while [he] worked on the \nfence\u201d and \u201cdrank two beers while we waited for the investigator.\u201d GE 10 at 4. Applicant went on \nto explain his interaction with the police wherein, after complying with an officer\u2019s instruction to \nmove his truck, the officer requested that Applicant perform a field sobriety test. In response to \nthe officer saying that he smelled alcohol on Applicant\u2019s breath, Applicant asserted that he \u201chad \ndrank two sixteen ounce beers on the side of the road while waiting for him and to fix the fence.\u201d \nId. The foregoing information indeed mirrors Applicant\u2019s hearing testimony; however, and quite \nnotably, nowhere in the statement did Applicant acknowledge having had anything else to drink \nprior to arriving at the scene. That significant detail was omitted from Applicant\u2019s very first \nreporting of the incident to DoD, which further weighs against his candor. \nIt is well-established that \u201c[d]etermining the weight and credibility of the evidence is the \nspecial province of the trier of fact.\u201d Inwood Labs., Inc. v. Ives Labs., Inc., 456 U.S. 844, 856 \n(1982). In addition to the evidence discussed above that reflects on Applicant\u2019s candor, the record \ncontains numerous conflicts between Applicant\u2019s account and other evidence. For example, \ncontrary to Applicant\u2019s explanation that he drank two beers at the accident scene, the reporting \nofficer noted that no open containers were found during an inventory of the vehicle. GE 8 at 3. \nAdditionally, Applicant\u2019s wife reported that she saw him with his last drink, which he left at their \nhouse and did not bring with him in the car before returning to the scene, and which was still on \nthe table when she returned home. Applicant\u2019s wife also reported that she checked the vehicle \nherself and found no open containers. Id. When conflicts exist within the record, a judge must \nweigh the evidence and resolve conflicts \u201cbased upon a careful evaluation of factors such as the \ncomparative reliability, plausibility and ultimate truthfulness of conflicting pieces of evidence.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 05-06723 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 14, 2007). Here, the Judge\u2019s resolution of conflicts \n3 The RFI was issued \u201cto aid in the determination of [Applicant\u2019s] eligibility for access to classified information.\u201d GE \n10 at 6. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nbetween Applicant\u2019s account and the police report was reasonable and sustainable. We find no \nreason not to give deference to the Judge\u2019s negative credibility determination regarding Applicant. \nChallenge to Application of Mitigating Conditions and Whole-Person Analysis \nThe remainder of Applicant\u2019s argument on appeal is that the Judge failed to duly consider \nand give adequate weight to his favorable evidence in terms of possible mitigation and application \nof the Whole-Person Concept. For example, Applicant repeatedly challenges the Judge\u2019s \nconclusion that he has yet to accept responsibility and accountability for his conduct. See Appeal \nBrief at 3, 10, 12, 14, 15 (referring to Decision at 10). Applicant argues that the Judge\u2019s finding \nthat AG 23 \u00b6\u00b6 (a) and (b) did not apply was in error and relied on \u201cthe improper finding that \n[Applicant] failed to accept responsibility for his actions.\u201d Appeal Brief at 14. He asserts that the \nrecord reflected, and the Judge ignored, \u201csignificant evidence that [Applicant] has made significant \nlifestyle changes since the 2019 incident which is indicative that [he] has acknowledged a change \nwas necessary.\u201d Id. (emphasis in original). \nApplicant also argues that the Judge \u201cfailed to give any consideration in his analysis to \nfavorable evidence offered by [Applicant] through testimony and exhibits and instead substituted \nhis own impression of [Applicant] contrary to favorable record evidence.\u201d Appeal Brief at 14. The \ndecision reflects that the Judge considered the evidence favorable to Applicant, including his \nefforts to remain sober; his therapist\u2019s report of treatment progress and characterization of the two \ndrinks in 2022 being \u201clapses,\u201d not \u201crelapses;\u201d and his honorable military service and his favorable \ncharacter evidence. Decision at 10, 12. When weighed against a lengthy and significant history of \nalcohol-involved personal and criminal incidents, however, the Judge had \u201clingering concerns \nabout [Applicant\u2019s] drinking and the extremely poor judgment he exhibited while drinking,\u201d and \nultimately concluded that the record left questions and doubts about Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance. Id. Applicant\u2019s arguments regarding the Judge\u2019s application of \nmitigating and whole-person factors amounts to a disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the \nevidence, which is not sufficient to demonstrate that the Judge weighed the evidence or reached \nconclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007). \nApplicant has not established that the Judge committed harmful error. The Judge examined \nthe relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision, and the record \nevidence supports that the Judge\u2019s findings and conclusions are sustainable. \u201cThe general standard \nis that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national \nsecurity.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v.
