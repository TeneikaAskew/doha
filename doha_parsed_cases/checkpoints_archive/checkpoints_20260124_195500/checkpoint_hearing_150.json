The Statement of Reasons (SOR) \nalleges Applicant\u2019s son, stepmother and half-siblings are citizens and residents of \nPakistan. In 2008 and 2016, he was convicted of Driving Under the Influence (DUI). \nApplicant has mitigated the foreign influence, alcohol consumption, and criminal conduct \nsecurity concerns. Clearance is granted.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nOn October 2, 2017, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DoD CAF) issued an SOR to Applicant, detailing the security concerns under \nGuideline B, foreign influence, Guideline G, alcohol consumption, and Guideline J, \ncriminal conduct, under which it was unable to find it clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue security clearance eligibility for him.  \n \n \nThe DoD CAF took the action under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive \n\n \n2 \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility \nfor Access to Classified Information (AG) effective within the DoD on June 8, 2017. \n \nOn October 30, 2017, Applicant answered the SOR allegations and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA). On November 26, 2018, DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing scheduling a hearing \nthat was conducted on December 11, 2018.  \n \nSix Government exhibits (Ex. 1 \u2013 6) and seven Applicant exhibits (Ex. A \u2013 G) were \nadmitted into evidence without objection. Documents submitted by Applicant as \nattachments to his SOR answer were also considered. Applicant testified, as reflected in \na transcript (Tr.) received on January 2, 2019.  \n \n \nAdministrative Notice \n \n \nDepartment Counsel requested that administrative notice be taken of certain facts \nabout Pakistan and United Arab Emirates (UAE). Without objection, I have taken \nadministrative notice of the facts contained in the request. The facts are summarized in \nthe written request and will not be repeated verbatim in this decision. The material was \nadmitted as Hearing Exhibit (HE) A and B. I have also taken administrative notice of facts \nabout Egypt from the U.S. Department of State website. These facts come from source \nmaterial published by the Department of State and Department of Justice. The facts are \nlimited to matters of general knowledge and not subject to reasonable dispute.  \n \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations and stated he had \nnot had contact with his stepmother or half-siblings in the past four years. He explained \nthe 2016 DUI was contributed to by the pain and sorrow over his ex-wife\u2019s death.  \nApplicant is a 64-year-old linguist who is being sponsored by a defense contractor. \nHe started working for the contractor in 2014. (Tr. 11, 21) However, until his clearance is \nadjudicated, he is working full-time for a military exchange store and has a second job \nworking for a discount variety store. (Tr. 21) In December 2017, he submitted his expired \nPakistani passport to his defense contractor employer to be destroyed. (Ex. E) In 2011, \nhe worked as a linguist for the U.S. Air Force in Qatar. (Tr. 21) The record is silent as to \nhis duty performance while employed as a linguist.  \nApplicant was born in Pakistan and left in 1980, after graduating from university. \n(Tr. 25) He then worked for 20 years in the UAE. (Tr. 12) In 2000, he moved to the United \nStates. He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in September 2008. (Tr. 24) In 2000, he \nmarried and helped raise his wife\u2019s three children and four grandchildren. In 2010, they \nseparated when one of the grandchildren, an illegal drug user, threatened to kill Applicant. \n(Ex. 5, Tr. 36) His wife chose to stay with her grandchildren, and she moved with them \nout of state. Applicant and his wife subsequently reconciled and she returned before her \nfirst of three heart attacks. (Tr. 36) She died of the final heart attack. \n\n \n3 \nApplicant has one son who is a citizen and resident of Pakistan, but is in the \nprocess of becoming a naturalized U.S. citizen and moving to the United States. In \nSeptember 2012, the I-130 Immigrant Petition for Relative was approved for his son. (Ex. \nA) His son was scheduled to arrive in the United Stated in March 2018, but delays in \nprocessing by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service (CIS) have slowed the date \nof his son\u2019s arrival. At the time of the December 2018 hearing, Applicant had been told \nthe CIS was, processing individuals who should have arrived in March 2018.  \n \nApplicant expected his son, barring additional delays, to arrive in the United States \nwithin the month following the hearing. The immigration process would have been \nquicker, but an immigration letter had been sent to, but not received by Applicant. Non \nreceipt of the letter slowed the process. Applicant\u2019s son is likely to immigrate to the United \nStates based, in part, on the history of Applicant\u2019s other two children, both of whom are \nliving in the United States. His daughter is a naturalized U.S. citizen, a grandmother, and \nhousewife. His son living in the United States is a permanent U.S. resident who recently \nwas informed he is now eligible to apply to become a naturalized U.S. citizen. (Tr. 40). \nThis son works at a convenience store. (Tr. 41)  \nApplicant\u2019s mother died when Applicant was a year-and-a-half old. He was raised \nby his grandmother until her death when he was five or six. (Tr. 28) He was then raised \nby his uncle. (Tr. 25) His father remarried and lived 500 miles away from Applicant. \nApplicant was 17 or 18 years old and had graduated from high school when he met his \nfather. (Tr. 28) After high school graduation, Applicant visited his father and his father\u2019s \nnew family for two days. (Tr. 30) His father married a woman who owned some land and \nlived off the income from the land. Applicant does not remember his father ever having a \njob. (Tr. 30) \nApplicant has a half-brother who is a resident of the UAE, a half-sister who was a \nresident of Oman, but has moved back to Pakistan, and four half-brothers and three half-\nsisters who are residents of Pakistan. (Ex. 4, Tr. 48) To the best of his knowledge, none \nof his half-siblings or any other relatives are affiliated in any way with a foreign \ngovernment or military. (Ex. 5)  \nDuring Applicant\u2019s his two-day visit, when he was 17 or 18, he asked his father \nwhy his half-siblings were not pursuing their educations. (Tr. 31) His father said he was \ndoing the best he could. His half-siblings\u2019 education ended at the seventh or eighth grade \nlevel. (Tr. 21) Applicant does not know all of his half-siblings\u2019 employment, but knows that \nsome of them are not working and the majority are farmers. (Ex. 5, Tr. 31) He saw his \nstep-sibling and stepmother in 2005 and in 2010 or 2011 when he visited his father in the \nhospital. He last saw his half-siblings in 2013 when he cared for his father prior to and \nwhile his father was again in the hospital. (Ex. 4, Ex. 5, Tr. 13, 46, 51, 78) Applicant has \nno written communication with his half-siblings or stepmother and does not send them \ngreeting or holiday cards. (Tr. 47) \nApplicant did not return to Pakistan in 2015 when his father died, having been \nadvised against doing so by his company. (Tr. 51, 52) Additionally, he did not learn of his \n\n \n4 \nfather\u2019s death in time for him to arrive for the funeral. (Tr. 52) He has little information as \nto the full names and occupations of these individuals. (Tr. 13)  \nApplicant once owned property worth $7,500 in Pakistan that he inherited from his \nmother. (Ex. 4) He no longer owns that property, having transferred it to his half-sister in \n2011. (Tr. 45) Additionally, Applicant has no bank accounts, property, investments or any \nother financial interest in Pakistan or in any foreign country. (Ex. 5, Tr. 45) \nIn 2008, Applicant was convicted of Open Container and DUI. He accepted the \ncharges and paid a $700 fine even though the partial bottle of wine had been left in his \ncar by another person. (Tr. 55) Applicant asserted he does not drink wine, but drinks beer. \n(Tr. 54) There was no blood alcohol test at the time of his arrest. (Tr. 57) In a March 2015 \nEnhanced Subject Interview (Ex. 5), he said he had been given the option of paying a \n$300 fine or fighting the charge. Applicant admitted he had been drinking alcohol before \nbeing stopped, but denies he was intoxicated. (Ex. 5)  \nIn January 2016, Applicant was again arrested for DUI (misdemeanor). (Ex. F, Tr. \n64) He asserted it was raining, and he was driving to the store to get cigarettes when a \ndog ran out onto the road. (Tr. 60) He hit his brakes to avoid the dog, and his vehicle \nskidded, hitting a traffic sign, and drifted across the frozen grass into the ditch. (Ex. D) A \nbreath test registered a blood alcohol content (BAC) of .123. (Ex. E, Ex. 6) He believes \nthat going to get those cigarettes cost him $6,000. (Ex. 5, Tr. 71) He said he had been \ndrinking because he was missing his wife who had died a few months earlier. (Tr. 61)  \nApplicant received a deferred sentence and was placed on probation for 18 \nmonths. His probation ended in November 2017. In August 2016, he completed the \nVictims\u2019 Impact Panel, and in September 2016, he completed a 24-hour DUI Offender \nAssessment course during which he learned not to drive after having one drink. (Ex. G, \nTr. 68) The class was offered for one or two hours per session over a number of days. \n(Tr. 69) On November 1, 2017, all the conditions of the deferred judgment and sentence \nhad been satisfied, and all fines, cost, and all assessment had been paid as ordered. (Ex. \nB) The court found Applicant should be discharged without a court judgment of guilt, and \nthe plea of guilty or nolo contendere was expunged from the record and the charge \ndismissed. An Order Withdrawing, Dismissing, and Expunging Plea was entered. (Ex. B)  \nApplicant last drank in January 2016, at the time of his arrest. (Tr. 70) He no longer \ndrinks alcohol and does not intend to consume alcohol in the future. (Ex. 5) He also \nrefrains from going to parties where alcohol is likely to be present. (Tr. 70) \n \nPakistan \n \nPakistan is a parliamentary Islamic republic with significant internal problems \ncaused by terrorist organizations concentrated in several locations within the country. A \nU.S. State Department Travel Warning for Pakistan remains in effect. The State \nDepartment warns that U.S. citizens not travel to Pakistan due to terrorism. Since 2014, \nparts of Pakistan\u2019s Federally Administered Tribal Areas, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, \nand Baluchistan province were regarded as safe havens for terrorist groups, including al-\n\n \n5 \nQaida, the Haqqani Network, Taliban Pakistan, Lashkar e-Tayyiba, Jaish-e-Mohammad, \nand the Afghan Taliban. These groups create ongoing security problems by targeting \nwestern interests, U.S. citizens, senior Pakistani officials, minority political groups, and \nreligious entities. In September 2012, the United States officially declared the Haqqani \nNetwork a foreign terrorist organization. Operations since 2014 by the Pakistani military \nagainst some of the terror groups have met with only marginal success. There have been \nnumerous terrorist attacks throughout Pakistan with large number of casualties. (HE A) \n \nThe human rights record of Pakistan is not good. Extrajudicial killings, torture, and \ndisappearances have been reported, along with intrusive government surveillance of \npoliticians, political activists, and the media. Government and police corruption, sexual \nharassment, and gender discrimination are persistent problems. Although, Applicant has \nnot lived in the UAE for 19 years, the submitted material on the UAE was reviewed. (HE \nB) It is noted that terrorist concerns and human rights abuses in the UAE are not as \nsignificant as in Pakistan.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which must be considered in evaluating \nan applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe adjudication process is an examination of a sufficient period and a careful weight of a \nnumber of variables of an individual\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the \nindividual is an acceptable security risk. This is known as the whole-person concept.  \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \n\n \n6 \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination of the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \nThe foreign influence concern is set forth at AG \u00b6 6, as follows:  \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial interests, and property interest, are a national security concern if \nthey result in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security \nconcern if they create circumstances in which the individual may be \nmanipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or \ngovernment in a way that is inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise \nmade vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. \nAssessment of foreign contacts and interests should consider country in \nwhich the foreign contact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, \nconsiderations such as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain \nclassified or sensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nThe nature of a country\u2019s government, its relationship to the United States, and its \nhuman rights record, are relevant in evaluating the chances that an applicant\u2019s family \nmembers are vulnerable to government pressure or influence. As the guideline indicates, \nthe country in question must be considered. Terrorist organizations, including the Taliban \nand al-Qaeda, continue to operate against the United States and Pakistani interests within \nPakistan. The country has a poor human rights record that is aggravated and exacerbated \nby the country\u2019s terrorism and violence. \n \nThe potentially conflicting loyalties raised by foreign contacts must be weighed to \ndetermine if an applicant can be expected to resolve any conflict in favor of U.S. interests. \nThere is no evidence that the Pakistani government targets U.S. citizens for protected \ninformation. Human rights issues in the Pakistan continue to be a concern. While none of \nthese considerations by themselves dispose of the issue, they are all factors to be \nconsidered in determining Applicant\u2019s vulnerability to pressure or coercion because of his \nson, half-siblings and step mother live in Pakistan. \n \n\n \n7 \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s ties to foreign family members, the totality of an \napplicant\u2019s foreign family ties as well as each individual family tie must be considered. AG \n\u00b6 7 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying:  \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual's \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology. \n \n \nAn applicant\u2019s contacts and ties to family members who are citizens of a foreign \ncountry to not automatically disqualify an applicant from security clearance access. The \nAG \u00b6 7(a) contacts are only disqualifying if they create a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, pressure, or coercion. The presence of terrorist and insurgent organizations, \nand the unstable security situation within Pakistan intensify the heightened risk of foreign \nmanipulation and exploitation that exists because Applicant\u2019s son, stepmother, and half-\nsiblings are citizens and residents of Pakistan. \n \n  \nAt one time, Applicant received an inheritance from his mother in Pakistan worth \napproximately $7,500, but he no longer owns the property. Having had a prior ownership \ninterest in an inheritance, which he no longer has, is not a disqualifying concern. He has \nno bank accounts, property, or investments in Pakistan or any other foreign country. \n \n \nAs for the foreign influence concerns raised by his family members\u2019 citizenship and \nresidence in Pakistan (See generally AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and (b)), Applicant clearly mitigated the \nconcerns. He established in whole or in part the following mitigating conditions under AG \n\u00b6 8: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n \n\n \n8 \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \n \nApplicant\u2019s stepmother and half-siblings are citizens and residents of Pakistan. \nApplicant never grew up with his stepmother or half-siblings and has had extremely \nlimited contact with them. He grew up living more than 500 miles from them. His last \ncontact with them was in 2013. He saw them for two days following his high school \ngraduation. He saw them in 2005 and in 2010 or 2011 when he visited his father in the \nhospital. He last saw his half-siblings in 2013 when he visited Pakistan during his father\u2019s \nillness. Overall, the level of contacts that Applicant has with his stepmother and half-\nsiblings does not create a heightened risk of foreign influence under AG \u00b6 7(a) or \u00b6 7(b). \nAdditionally, AG \u00b6 8(a), \u00b6 8(b), and \u00b6 8(c) would apply if there was a \u00b6 7(a) or \u00b6 7(b) \nconcern raised about these relatives. I find for Applicant as to SOR 1.b \u20131.f. \n \nConcerning Applicant\u2019s son, who is a citizen and resident of Pakistan, it must be \ndetermined if his relationships with his son creates a risk of foreign exploitation, \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion by terrorists or would create a potential \nconflict of interest between his obligations to protect sensitive information and his desire \nto help his son who may be threatened by terrorists. Applicant\u2019s daughter is a naturalized \nU.S. citizen and his other son is a permanent U.S. resident. Both are living in the United \nStates. There is no security risk created by his children living in the United States.  \n \nThe activities of the government of Pakistan and terrorist organizations within \nPakistan must be reviewed because of son\u2019s presence in Pakistan. The evidence of \nrecord fails to show that the Pakistani government targets U.S. citizens in the United \nStates or in Pakistan by exploiting, manipulating, pressuring, or coercing them to obtain \nprotected information. Thus, the concern that the Pakistani Government will seek \nclassified information is moderate. The same cannot be said of terrorists\u2019 organizations \noperating in Pakistan, whose goals are to destroy or prevent the growth of a stable, central \ngovernment in Pakistan. Due to terrorists\u2019 activities in Pakistan, the security concern must \nbe carefully reviewed. \nApplicant\u2019s son is in the process of becoming a naturalized U.S. citizen and moving \nto the United States. In September 2012, Applicant was notified the I-130 Immigrant \nPetition for Relative was approved for his son. His son should have arrived in March 2018, \nbut delays in processing by the CIS slowed his son\u2019s immigration. At the time of the \nDecember 2018 hearing, Applicant had been told the CIS was processing individuals who \nshould have arrived in March 2018.  \n \nApplicant expected his son, barring additional delays, to arrive in the United States \nwithin the month following the hearing. Applicant\u2019s son is likely to come to the United \nStates based, in part, on the history of Applicant\u2019s other two children. His other two \nchildren live in the United States. One is a naturalized U.S. citizen and the other, a \npermanent U.S. resident, has recently been informed he can now apply to become a \nnaturalized citizen.  \n \n\n \n9 \n \nSecurity clearance adjudications are predicative judgments, where an applicant\u2019s \npast history is the best indicator of future conduct. The Appeal Board has held that: \n \nGenerally, an Applicant\u2019s statements, by themselves, as to what he would \ndo in the face of threats by a foreign government or entity are entitled to \nlittle weight. On the other hand, an applicant\u2019s proven record of action in \ndefense of the U.S. is very important and can lead to a favorable result for \nan applicant in a Guideline B case. In this case, Applicant has served the \nU.S. military as a translator in dangerous circumstances in Pakistan and \nhas risked his life to protect American personnel there. (ISCR Case No. 07-\n00034 at 2 (App. Bd. Feb. 5, 2008). See also ISCR Case No. 06-25928 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 9, 2008); ISCR Case No. 05-03846 at 6 (App. Bd. Nov. 14, \n2006)). \n \n \nIn 2011, Applicant worked as a linguist for the U.S. Air Force in Qatar. He is again \nseeking employment as a linguist. In 2000, Applicant came to the United States. In 2008, \nhe became a U.S. naturalized citizen. His daughter is also a naturalized citizen and his \none son is a permanent U.S. resident. Both live in the United States. AG \u00b6 8(b) applies \nbecause his ties to the United States are substantial and longstanding. He has shown \nthat he can be counted on to act in the interests of the United States. Applicant mitigated \nthe foreign influence concerns.  \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n \nThe security concern for alcohol consumption is set forth in AG \u00b6 21:  \n \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 22. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable in this case:  \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with an alcohol use \ndisorder;  \n \n \nAs alleged in the SOR, and admitted, Applicant incurred two alcohol-related \noffenses: one in 2008 and the second in 2016. AG \u00b6 22(a) applies. In 2008, Applicant \nwas convicted of Open Container and DUI and paid $700. In January 2016, Applicant \nwas again arrested for DUI (misdemeanor). His BAC was .123. This arrest occurred more \nthan three years ago. Disqualifying condition AG \u00b6 22(a) provides: \n \n\n \n10 \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder. \n \n \nConditions that could mitigate alcohol consumption security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 23. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment; and \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations.  \n \n \nIn January 2016, Applicant drove his pickup to get a pack of cigarettes. He believes \ngoing to get those cigarettes cost him $6,000. He said he had been drinking because he \nwas missing his wife who had died a few months earlier. He received a deferred sentence \nand was placed on probation for 18 months. His probation ended in November 2017. In \nAugust 2016, he completed the Victims\u2019 Impact Panel and in September 2016, he \ncompleted a 24-hour DUI Offender Assessment course during which he learned not to \ndrive after having one drink.  \n \n \nOn November 1, 2017, all the conditions of the deferred judgment and sentence \nhad been satisfied and all fines, cost, and all assessment have been paid as ordered. The \ncourt found Applicant should be discharged without a court judgment of guilt. The plea of \nguilty or nolo contendere was expunged from the record and the charge dismissed. An \nOrder Withdrawing, Dismissing, and Expunging Plea was entered. \nApplicant last drank alcohol in January 2016, at the time of his arrest. He no longer \ndrinks alcohol and does not intend to consume alcohol in the future. He also refrains from \ngoing to parties where alcohol is likely to be present. Since January 2016, he has had no \ncriminal arrests or citations, alcohol-related or otherwise. There is no record evidence of \nsubsequent instances of intoxication. He does not consume alcohol, nor does he appear \nto socialize with those who do. He has therefore demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence. \n \n \nApplicant has demonstrated that his alcohol issues are unlikely to recur and are \nno longer a security concern. He has provided sufficient evidence to mitigate the alcohol-\nrelated security issues under AG \u00b6\u00b6 23(a) and (b).  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n11 \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 30: Criminal activity creates \ndoubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it \ncalls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s two alcohol related arrests were cross alleged under Guideline G, \nalcohol consumption, Guideline J, criminal conduct. The Appeal Board has held that \nsecurity-related conduct can be considered under more than one guideline, and in an \nappropriate case, be given independent weight under each. See ISCR Case No. 11-\n06672 (App. Bd. Jul. 2, 2012). The comments under Guideline G also apply to the \nGuideline J allegations.  \n \n \nThe two DUI arrests and convictions establish the following disqualifying conditions \nunder this guideline: \n \nAG \u00b6 31(a): a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would \nbe unlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n \nAG \u00b6 31(b): evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s two DUIs establish a pattern of criminal misconduct that casts doubt \nabout his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness, and calls into question his ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.  \n \n \nHowever, as previously stated, on November 1, 2017, all the conditions of \nApplicant\u2019s deferred judgment and sentence related to his most recent DUI arrest had \nbeen satisfied and all fines, cost, and all assessment have been paid as ordered. The \ncourt found Applicant should be discharged without a court judgment of guilt and the plea \nof guilty or nolo contendere was expunged from the record and the charge dismissed. An \nOrder Withdrawing, Dismissing, and Expunging Plea was entered. Additionally, Applicant \nlast drank in January 2016, at the time of his arrest. He no longer drinks alcohol and does \nnot intend to consume alcohol in the future. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s criminal conduct has been mitigated by the following applicable factor:\n \n \nAG \u00b6 32(a): so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior \nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances, that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \n\n \n12 \nAG \u00b6 32(d): there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not \nlimited to, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, \nrestitution, compliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or \nhigher education, good employment record, or constructive community \ninvolvement. \n \n \nApplicant complied with all court requirements. There has been a passage of time \nwithout recurrence of criminal activity to conclude that his questionable judgment and \ncriminal misconduct will not recur. AG \u00b6 32(a) and AG \u00b6 32(b) apply.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. My comments under Guidelines B, G, and J are incorporated in \nmy whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under those \nguidelines but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is a 64-year-old linguist who is currently awaiting adjudication of his \nsecurity clearance eligibility before being employed by a defense contractor. In 2011, he \nworked as a linguist for the U.S. Air Force in Qatar. His service in support of the U.S. \nmilitary merits considerable respect. He has a number of step-relatives, but has had \nextremely limited contact with them. His son, a citizen and resident of Pakistan, has \nrecently been informed he is authorized to come to the United States as a permanent \nU.S. resident. Applicant\u2019s other children have already immigrated to the United States. \nHis daughter is a naturalized U.S. citizen and his other son, a permanent U.S. resident, \nhas recently been informed he is now eligible to apply to become a naturalized U.S. \ncitizen. \n \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive \nand the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. The \n\n \n13 \nsalient issue is whether Applicant\u2019s son living in Pakistan and his two DUI convictions \nraise concerns about his fitness to hold a security clearance. (See AG & 2(c)) These \nwhole-person factors, in conjunction with the favorable matters noted above, fully mitigate \nthe foreign influence, alcohol consumption, and criminal conduct concerns. Overall, the \nrecord evidence leaves me with no questions or doubts about Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has \nmitigated the foreign influence, alcohol consumption, and criminal conduct security \nconcerns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Foreign Influence:  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u20131.f: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Alcohol Consumption: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a and 2.b: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3, Criminal Conduct:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is granted.  \n \n \n_______________________ \nCLAUDE R. HEINY II \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Eligibility to occupy a public trust position is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn August 28, 2016, Applicant applied for a public trust position and submitted an \nElectronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP). On October 30, 2017, the \nDepartment of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to her, under DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and \nmodified (Directive); and Directive 4 of the Security Executive Agent (SEAD 4), National \nSecurity Adjudicative Guidelines (December 10, 2016) (AG), for all covered individuals \nwho require initial or continued eligibility for access to classified information or eligibility \nto hold a sensitive position, effective June 8, 2017. \nThe SOR alleged trustworthiness concerns under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations), and detailed reasons why the DOD CAF was unable to make an \naffirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest \n02/05/2019\n\n \n2 \n                                      \n \nto grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for occupying a public trust position to support a contract \nwith the DOD. The SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine \nwhether such eligibility should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  \n \n \nIt is unclear when Applicant received the SOR as there is no receipt in the case \nfile. In a sworn statement, dated February 15, 2018, Applicant responded to the SOR and \nelected to have her case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. A complete \ncopy of the Government\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) was mailed to Applicant by the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) on October 26, 2018, and she was \nafforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, \nor mitigation. In addition to the FORM, Applicant was furnished a copy of the Directive as \nwell as the Adjudicative Guidelines applicable to his case. Applicant received the FORM \non November 11, 2018. Applicant\u2019s response was due within 30 days of the receipt of the \nFORM. Applicant apparently chose not to respond to the FORM, for as of January 17, \n2019, she had not done so. The case was assigned to me on January 30, 2019.   \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted with comments some of the factual \nallegations in the SOR (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b., 1.e., 1.f., and 1.h.).

After a \ncomplete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration \nof same, I make the following additional findings of fact:  \n \nApplicant is 33 years old. It is unclear what her current employment status is for \nthe records indicate that she is a teacher-assistant with a local county school system (as \nof October 2016) during the day; and an unspecified type of employee of a local health \ncenter (as of September 2016) during the evenings; or an employee or employee-\ncandidate (at least since April 2018) with an unspecified position in a local military \nhospital.

She received a certification in massage \ntherapy in October 2005. Applicant has never served with the U.S. military. She has never \nheld a security clearance, and it is unclear if she ever held a position of public trust. \nApplicant has never married, but she has been cohabitating since September 2007.  She \nhas five children, born in 2003 (residing with the child\u2019s father), 2009, 2010, 2013, and \n2015. \n \n \n \n\n \n3 \n                                      \n \nFinancial Considerations1 \n \nIt is unclear when Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties first arose. Applicant attributed \nher financial problems to several different factors: 1) according to her e-QIP entries, in \nMarch 2013, because she was disappointed with her job, expecting a baby, and having \nmigraine headaches, she decided to quit the job she had held since March 2006, and \n\u201ctake care of [her] health and stay at home with [her] children;\u201d 2) she remained \nunemployed until February 2014, as a \u201cstay at home mom;\u201d 3) she was again unemployed \nfrom June 2014 until September 2014; 4) she loaned her brother\u2019s significant-other an \nunspecified amount to catch up on their bills, but the money was never paid back; 5) her \nfianc\u00e9 and she made poor job decisions that did not work out; 6) her son\u2019s father refused \nto furnish her with insurance information to resolve a medical bill; 7) when she was unable \nto pay her property taxes in 2015, her tax refund was applied to the debt; and 8) she had \npoor money management and financial decision-making.2  \n \nDuring her OPM interview, she added: 9) her fianc\u00e9 was trying to run a self-\nemployed business as a wedding disc jockey, but the business failed and they were left \nin a difficult financial situation.3 In her Answer to the SOR, she added: 10) she had \ninsufficient funds to keep her mortgage payments current; 11) she was unaware that her \nfianc\u00e9 was intercepting the mail associated with their home mortgage; and 12) she was \nunaware that her fianc\u00e9 was not making the monthly payments on the car loan for which \nshe had cosigned.4 Applicant\u2019s credit reports included additional information. In 2012 \nthere was a judgment filed against her for $316, which was paid in April 2013; and the \nmortgage on her house was chronically late, between 30 and 120 days past due, as early \nas 2010.5  \n \nThe SOR identified eight purportedly continuing delinquent debts totaling $14,287 \nthat had been placed for collection, charged off, or gone to foreclosure (not including the \nunspecified unpaid mortgage balance on a home mortgage that was foreclosed), as \nreflected by the September 2016 credit report or the April 2017 credit report. While \nApplicant contended that several of the accounts were on repayment plans and were \nbeing paid, or were already paid off, with some exceptions, she failed to submit \nmeaningful documentation from her creditors, such as copies of those plans or receipts, \nto support her own handwritten notes that certain agreements had been reached. As for \nthe other accounts, she claimed that she would make either continuing payments or start \n                                                          \n1 General source information pertaining to the financial issues discussed below can be found in the \nfollowing exhibits: Item 3 (e-QIP, dated August 28, 2016); Item 5 (Combined Experian, TransUnion, and \nEquifax Credit Report, dated September 9, 2016); Item 4 (Experian Credit Report, dated April 3, 2017; Item \n6 (Enhanced Subject Interview, dated April 12, 2017); and Item 2 (Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, dated \nFebruary 15, 2018).  \n \n2 Item 3, supra note 1, at 13-16, 37-41. \n \n3 Item 6, supra note 1, at 4-5. \n \n4 Item 2, supra note 1, at 1-2. \n \n5 Item 5, supra note 1, at 5; Item 4, supra note 1, at 12. \n \n\n \n4 \n                                      \n \nmaking payments in February 2018, when she anticipated receiving a refund from the \nInternal Revenue Service (IRS).6  \n \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent accounts are as follows: a telephone account with an unpaid \nbalance of $231 that was eventually settled for less than the full balance with two \npayments of $67 in April 2017 (SOR \u00b6 1.a.);7 an individual home mortgage, originally in \nthe amount of $115,995, that was foreclosed in May 2015 when the credit grantor \nreclaimed collateral to settle the mortgage (SOR \u00b6 1.b.);8 a joint automobile loan for \n$13,987, of which $10,601 was charged off, and Applicant has made no effort to resolve \n(SOR \u00b6 1.c.);9 a satellite television account with an unpaid balance of $778 that was \npurportedly settled for $428, and a payment of that amount in April 2017, but for which \nthere is no documentation to support Applicant\u2019s contention that there was a settlement \n(SOR \u00b6 1.d.);10 and an unspecified type of account with an unpaid balance of $1,089 for \nwhich Applicant purportedly entered into a payment arrangement calling for a $282 \npayment in February 2018, and Applicant\u2019s promise to pay the remainder upon receipt of \nher income tax refund in late February 2018, but for which there is no documentation to \nsupport the existence of a repayment arrangement or subsequent payments (SOR \u00b6 \n1.e.).11  \n \nIn addition, there are a medical account with an unpaid balance of $728 for which \nApplicant purportedly entered into a payment arrangement calling for a $5 payment in \nJanuary 2018, and Applicant\u2019s promise to either continuing paying that amount each \nmonth or pay the remainder upon receipt of her income tax refund in late February 2018, \nbut for which there is no documentation to support the existence of a repayment \narrangement or subsequent payments (SOR \u00b6 1.f.);12 a cable television account with an \n                                                          \n6 It should be noted that the Appeal Board has indicated that promises to pay off delinquent debts \nin the future are not a substitute for a track record of paying debts in a timely manner and otherwise acting \nin a financially responsible manner.

There \nis no evidence of a budget. Applicant did not explain what corrective actions she has \ntaken over an extensive period to avoid the pitfalls or other factors that she identified as \nthe ones that caused her financial difficulties. She offered no explanation for her failure \nto make attempts to resolve her accounts before she was interviewed by the OPM \ninvestigator on February 12, 2017 \u2013 the same day she made her initial modest payments \nto her creditors. Furthermore, there is no Personal Financial Statement to reflect her net \nmonthly income, monthly expenses, or any remainder available for discretionary use or \nsavings. There is no evidence to indicate that Applicant\u2019s financial situation is now under \ncontrol.  \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a [position of public trust].\u201d15 As Commander in Chief, the President \nhas the authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to \ndetermine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such \ninformation.

Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). \n \n16 It should be noted that a memorandum from the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for \nCounterintelligence and Security, Adjudication of Trustworthiness Cases, dated November 19, 2004, \ncovers the handling of trustworthiness cases under the Directive. The memorandum directed the Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) to continue to utilize the Directive in ADP contractor cases for \ntrustworthiness determinations. \n \n\n \n6 \n                                      \n \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and common \nsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. \n \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d17 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish \na potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced \nsubstantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nhas the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation \nor mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.18  \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to sensitive \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information.  Furthermore, security clearance \ndeterminations, and by inference, public trust determinations, should err, if they must, on \nthe side of denials.19 In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations \nis set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \n                                                          \n17 \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as \nadequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 \nat 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1).  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla \nbut less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. \n1994). \n \n18 See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \n19 Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n\n \n7 \n                                      \n \n      \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns \nunder AG \u00b619:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \n \nApplicant has had a long-standing problem with her finances, in part because she \nmade poor job decisions, and she exercised poor money management and financial \ndecision-making. As a result, various accounts became delinquent, a house was \nforeclosed, and a vehicle was apparently repossessed. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) have been \nestablished, but AG \u00b6 19(b) has not been established.  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate \ntrustworthiness concerns arising from financial difficulties under AG \u00b6 20: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;20 \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n                                                          \n20 A debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \u201can \napplicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, can be viewed \nas recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. \nFeb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). \n \n\n \n8 \n                                      \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.21  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) minimally applies, but none of the remaining mitigating conditions \napply. The nature, frequency, and recency of Applicant\u2019s continuing financial difficulties \nmake it difficult to conclude that it occurred \u201cso long ago\u201d or \u201cwas so infrequent,\u201d or that it \nis \u201cunlikely to recur.\u201d While Applicant generally attributed her financial difficulties to a \nvariety of factors, in truth, few, if any, of those factors were due to conditions that were \nlargely beyond her control. Choosing to quit a job because of disappointment with it; \nbecoming a \u201cstay-at-home mom\u201d for multiple years; lending her brother an unspecified \namount to catch up on his bills, but ignoring her own bills; or assisting her fianc\u00e9 with his \nbusiness aspirations, were all choices made by her, not consequences imposed upon \nher. Applicant was interviewed by an OPM investigator on April 12, 2017 \u2013 the same day \nshe made the first payment on any of her SOR-related debts, and under those \ncircumstances, it is difficult to conclude that Applicant made any good-faith efforts before \nthe interview to resolve her debts. An applicant who begins to resolve his or her financial \nproblems only after being placed on notice that his or her eligibility for a public trust \nposition is in jeopardy may be lacking in the judgment and self-discipline to follow rules \nand regulations over time or when there is no immediate threat to his or her own \ninterests.22 \nThere is no evidence of a budget. There is no evidence of any financial counseling. \nThere is no evidence of disputes. Applicant offered no evidence to indicate that her \nfinancial situation is now under better control. In this instance, to date, there is minimal \nmeaningful evidence that corrective actions have been taken by Applicant. Applicant\u2019s \n                                                          \n21 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant must \npresent evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some \nother good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not \ndefine the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-\nfaith \u201crequires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, \nhonesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d Accordingly, an applicant must do more than \nmerely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as bankruptcy [or \nstatute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition].  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \n \n22 See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01213 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 29, 2018); ISCR Case No. 17-00569 at \n3-4 (App. Bd. Sept. 18, 2018). \n \n\n \n9 \n                                      \n \nactions, or inaction, under the circumstances cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment.23 \nTrustworthiness decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines \ndo not require an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the \nSOR. An applicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take \nsignificant actions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant \nimmediately resolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, \nnor is there a requirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. \nRather, a reasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such \ndebts, or resolution of such issues, one at a time. Mere promises to pay debts in the \nfuture, especially after a multi-year delay in taking any action, without further confirmed \naction, are insufficient. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a position of public trust by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider \nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant \neligibility for a position of public trust must be an overall commonsense judgment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I \nhave evaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record \nevidence and have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis.24  \n  \nThere is some evidence mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct. Applicant is 33 years old. \nAs of late 2016, she was a teacher-assistant with a local county school system during the \nday, and an unspecified type of employee of a local health center during the evenings; \nand as of at least April 2018, an employee or employee-candidate with an unspecified \nposition in a local military hospital. She is a high school graduate, and she has a \n                                                          \n23 See ISCR Case No. 09-08533 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2010). \n \n24 See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-\n3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006). \n \n\n \n10 \n                                      \n \ncertification in massage therapy. In April 2017, she made some modest payments on two \nof her delinquent debts, and in February she made a few more modest payments.  \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. \nApplicant essentially ignored her debts over the years, but eventually was motivated to \nstart addressing them once she decided to apply for a new job. That motivation did not \ncommence until she was interviewed by an OPM investigator. Her mortgage was \nforeclosed due to non-payment, a vehicle was apparently repossessed, and several debts \nare still ignored. She contended that there were repayment arrangements, but failed to \nsubmit documentation to support her contentions. She claimed that a telephone company \nand a cable television company were one and the same, but failed to follow through with \nany evidence. When she had the opportunity to present evidence of repayment \narrangements and payments, with a few exceptions, she failed to do so, even after the \nFORM was sent to her. Considering all of the above, I am unable to reach a positive \nconclusion pertaining to Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a position of public trust. \nThe Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in \nfinancial cases stating:25 \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d necessarily includes evidence of actual \ndebt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not \nrequired, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off each \nand every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he [or she] has \u201c. . . established a plan to resolve his [or \nher] financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d \nThe Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the extent to which that \napplicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible \nand realistic. See Directive \u00b6 E2.2(a) (\u201cAvailable, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be \nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u201d) There is no requirement that a \nplan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, \na reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment \nof such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first \ndebts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones \nlisted in the SOR. \n \nApplicant has demonstrated an extremely poor track record of debt reduction and \nelimination efforts, seemingly avoiding her debts until after her OPM interview. Overall, \nthe evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility \nand suitability for a position of public trust. For all of these reasons, I conclude Applicant \nhas failed to mitigate the trustworthiness concerns arising from her financial \nconsiderations. See SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d)(1) through AG 2(d)(9). \n                                                          \n25 ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd.

The SOR further informed \nApplicant that, based on information available to the government, DoD adjudicators \ncould not make the preliminary affirmative finding it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on December 26, 2017, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. (Answer.) The case was assigned to me on January 29, \n2018. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing \non February 2, 2018, scheduling the hearing for February 22, 2018. The hearing was \nconvened as scheduled. The Government offered Exhibits (GXs) 1 through 5, which \nwere admitted into evidence. Applicant testified on her own behalf and offered ten \ndocuments, which I marked Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AppXs) A through J, and admitted into \nevidence. The record was left open until April 22, 2018, for receipt of additional \n\n \n2 \n \ndocumentation. On April 22, 2018, Applicant offered AppXs K and L, which were also \nadmitted into evidence.

Her father suffered from dementia, and her grandmother \u201clived to be 106 years old.\u201d \n(Id.) \n \nGuideline F \u2013 Financial Considerations \n \n \n1.a. and 1.b. Applicant admits that she filed both her Federal and state income \ntax returns in an untimely fashion from 2000~2015. (TR at page 39 line 5 to page 40 line \n20, see also TR at page 26 line 22 to page 32 line 13.) She attributes her late filings to \nher family pressures. (Id.) Applicant filed her 2016 tax returns in a timely fashion. (TR at \npage 39 line 5 to page 40 line 20.) \n \n \n1.c.~1.e. Applicant admits, in part, and denies, in part, that she owes back \nfederal income taxes for tax years 2012, 2013, 2015 and 2016, totaling about $10,320. \n(TR at page 40 line 21 to page 42 line 5; see also TR at page 32 line 14 to page 37 line \n19.) Pursuant to an \u201cInstallment Agreement,\u201d she is making monthly payments of about \n$160 to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), as evidenced by documentation from the \nIRS. (AppX J.) \n \n \nApplicant lives within her financial means, as evidenced by a monthly budget \nshowing a monthly surplus of about $689, including her IRS payments. (AppX L.) She is \nalso well respected at work and in her community as evidenced by eight letters of \nsupport. (AppX K.) These letters include those from a lawyer, from a law enforcement \nofficer, and from a Public Safety Commissioner.  (Id.) \n \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative \njudge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \nnational security eligibility. \n\n \n3 \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall \nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \n\n \n4 \n \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \n  \nApplicant failed to file both Federal and state income tax returns in a timely \nfashion. As a result, she owes the IRS about $10,000. The evidence is sufficient to raise \nthese disqualifying conditions.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 including: \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems have been addressed through payments to the \nIRS. She lives within her means, and has demonstrated that future financial problems \nare unlikely to occur in the future. Financial Considerations is found for Applicant.   \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. As noted above, Applicant is well respected \nboth at work and in her community.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated to mitigate the Financial Considerations security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nRichard A. Cefola \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn August 4, 2017, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline E (personal \nconduct). The action was taken under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by \nDOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant responded to the SOR on August 29, 2017, and requested a hearing. \nThe case was assigned to me on June 13, 2018. The Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on July 3, 2018, scheduling the hearing for \nAugust 9, 2018. I convened the hearing as scheduled. \n03/04/2019\n\n \n2 \n \nI marked the Government\u2019s exhibit list and discovery letter as Hearing Exhibit \n(HE) I. Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5 were admitted in evidence without \nobjection. Applicant testified. At Applicant\u2019s request, I held the record open until August \n23, 2018, for the receipt of additional evidence. Applicant timely provided \ndocumentation, which I marked collectively as AE A. Department Counsel objected to \nAE A on the ground that it was unreliable. I overruled Department Counsel\u2019s objection \nand admitted AE A in evidence. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on August \n17, 2018.                                                                                                                                                  \n                                                                                                                                                                  \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations.

He attended college from 1998 to \n2004, but he did not earn a degree. He has worked for his current employer, a defense \ncontractor, since May 2017. Since he started working for his current employer, he \nreceived two raises and was recently promoted. He has worked for various defense \ncontractors and held a security clearance since 2008.2  \n \n \nApplicant lied about having a bachelor\u2019s degree during a November 2008 \nbackground interview, on his August 2010 security clearance application (SCA), and \nduring a December 2016 background interview. He also lied about having a bachelor\u2019s \ndegree during the hiring process with a prospective employer in late 2011. Though this \nemployer fired him in early 2012 after learning that he did not have such a degree, he \nlied on his December 2015 SCA and during the 2016 background interview when he \nstated that he left this job in 2012 because he received a new employment offer (SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.f). He admitted that he initially lied about having a bachelor\u2019s degree, and the \ntrue reason for his 2012 firing, only after he was confronted during the 2016 interview.3 \n \n \nApplicant struggled academically in college. He was suspended for several \nsemesters because his grade point average fell below a 2.0. He walked away from \ncollege in 2004. He testified that lying about graduating from college is one of his life\u2019s \nbiggest regrets. He testified that he is ashamed that he never graduated, as he comes \nfrom a family who have earned professional degrees. He testified that he was in his \nearly 20s when he first told the lie, and he did not truly understand the ramifications. He \ntestified that when he applied for a job, \u201cthe lie just became my story . . . it\u2019s catching up \nto me now . . . with my security clearance.\u201d He expressed remorse for his deception, \nstating \u201cthat\u2019s not who I am, and it\u2019s something that I\u2019m . . . very, very ashamed about.\u201d4 \n                                                     \n1 Response to the SOR; Tr. at 7, 24-25, 91-92; GE 1-3.                    \n \n2 Tr. at 7-8, 25, 42-52, 78, 83-88; GE 1-3. \n \n3 Response to the SOR; Tr. at 22-110; GE 1-5. Applicant acknowledged that he likely lied about having a \nbachelor\u2019s degree to two other employers in around 2005 and 2007. Tr. at 29-32, 34-36. \n \n4 Tr. at 22-110. \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant testified that after his 2012 employment termination, he revised his \nresume to reflect only that he attended college from 1998 to 2004 in pursuit of a \nbachelor\u2019s degree. He testified that he gave his revised resume to his prior employer as \nwell as to his current employer. He testified that his current employer is aware that his \nhighest level of education is a high-school diploma. He provided a copy of his resume, \nwhich reflects under the heading titled \u201cEducation,\u201d the name of the college he attended \nand his area of study. He also provided copies of two emails, dated March 8, 2012 and \nApril 2, 2013, purporting to corroborate his testimony that he gave his revised resume to \nhis prior employer from 2014 to 2017. As both the emails reflect that he is both the \nsender and the receiver, I do not give these documents any weight.5 \n \n \nAs of the date of the hearing, Applicant\u2019s mother, siblings, and girlfriend were \nunaware that he did not have a bachelor\u2019s degree, and that he falsified information \nabout having one. Though he testified that he would not be concerned if they were to \nfind out, he has not yet told them because he is still ashamed. He does not want to \ndisappoint his mother.6 \n \n  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n                                                     \n5 Tr. at 83-87, 102-108; GE 4; AE A. \n \n6 Tr. at 91-99. \n\n \n4 \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of Exec. Or. 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Exec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct:  \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes.  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I considered the following relevant: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, \ninvestigator, security official, competent medical or mental health \nprofessional involved in making a recommendation relevant to a national \nsecurity \neligibility \ndetermination, \nor \nother \nofficial \ngovernment \nrepresentative; and \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \n\n \n5 \n \nincludes: (1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the \nperson\u2019s personal, professional, or community standing . . . . \n \nApplicant lied about having a bachelor\u2019s degree during his 2008 and 2016 \nbackground interviews and on his 2010 SCA. He also lied about having a bachelor\u2019s \ndegree during the hiring process with a prospective employer in late 2011. Though his \nthen-employer fired him in early 2012 after learning that he did not have such a degree, \nhe lied on his 2015 SCA and during the 2016 background interview when he stated that \nhe left this job in 2012 because he received a new employment offer. As of the date of \nthe hearing, his family was unaware that he did not have a bachelor\u2019s degree, and that \nhe falsified information about having one, because he is still ashamed to tell them. AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 16(a), 16(b), and 16(e)(1) apply. \nAG \u00b6 17 describes the following conditions that could mitigate the personal \nconduct security concerns: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; and \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \n \nApplicant admitted during his 2016 interview that he initially lied about having a \nbachelor\u2019s degree, and the true reason for his 2012 firing, only after he was confronted. \nAG \u00b6 17(a) does not apply.  \n \nApplicant expressed remorse at the hearing. However, his remorse does not \novercome his pattern of deception from 2008 to at least 2016. His family was also \nunaware that he did not have a bachelor\u2019s degree, and that he falsified information \nabout having one, because he was still ashamed to tell them. I continue to have doubts \nabout Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c), 17(d), and \n17(e) do not apply.  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline E in my whole-person analysis.  \n \nI considered Applicant\u2019s expression of remorse at the hearing. However, his \nremorse does not overcome his pattern of deception from 2008 to at least 2016. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not mitigate the \npersonal conduct security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.f: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant  \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact After a thorough review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make additional findings of fact. Applicant is 47 years old. He has a Bachelor\u2019s Degree in History awarded in 1995, and a Bachelor\u2019s Degree in information technology awarded in 1998. He is taking classes for a Master\u2019s degree in Information Systems Engineering. He has worked in the information technology field with defense contractors since November 1998. He has worked with the same defense contractor in information technology since May 2009. He was granted access to classified information in May 2009. Applicant married in June 1996 and has five children. (Tr. 43-47; GX 1, e-QIP, dated March 6, 2015) The SOR alleges two personal conduct security concerns. SOR 1.a is based on Applicant\u2019s failure to return three laptop computers to his children\u2019s private school after he performed maintenance on them. He did not inform the school he had the computers until late 2014, after revealing the information to his Government agency employer during a security clearance interview. SOR 1.b is based on Applicant\u2019s submission of a fraudulent letter to his Government Agency employer claiming a debt had been settled.

Schachter, Esq. \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nCREAN, Thomas M., Administrative Judge: \nBased on a review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I find that Applicant \nmitigated one, but not both, of the personal conduct security concerns. Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP) on March 6, 2015, to retain and upgrade a security clearance required for his \nduties with a defense contractor. The Department of Defense (DOD) issued Applicant a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns for personal conduct \n(Guideline E) on July 27, 2017. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG) effective in the DOD on June 8, 2017.  \nApplicant provided a detailed answer to the SOR on September 21, 2017. He \nadmitted both allegations under Guideline E. Department Counsel was prepared to \n02/07/2019\n\n2 \n \nproceed on October 19, 2017. I was assigned the case on April 13, 2018, the Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals sent a Notice of Hearing on September 10, 2018, for a \nhearing on October 10, 2018. I convened the case as scheduled. DOHA received the \ntranscript of the hearing (Tr.) on October 19, 2018.  \n \nThe Government introduced two exhibits I marked as Government Exhibits (GX) \n1 and 2. Applicant objected to Government Exhibit 2, the report of a polygraph \nexamination, as a report of investigation requiring an authenticating witness. I \ndetermined that the document was admissible and it was received as Government \nExhibit 2. (Tr. 13-18) Applicant and two witnesses testified. Applicant introduced eight \nexhibits which I marked and admitted into the record without objection as Applicant \nExhibits (AX) A through H.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nAfter a thorough review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make \nadditional findings of fact. Applicant is 47 years old. He has a Bachelor\u2019s Degree in \nHistory awarded in 1995, and a Bachelor\u2019s Degree in information technology awarded in \n1998. He is taking classes for a Master\u2019s degree in Information Systems Engineering. \nHe has worked in the information technology field with defense contractors since \nNovember 1998. He has worked with the same defense contractor in information \ntechnology since May 2009. He was granted access to classified information in May \n2009. Applicant married in June 1996 and has five children. (Tr. 43-47; GX 1, e-QIP, \ndated March 6, 2015) \n \nThe SOR alleges two personal conduct security concerns. SOR 1.a is based on \nApplicant\u2019s failure to return three laptop computers to his children\u2019s private school after \nhe performed maintenance on them. He did not inform the school he had the computers \nuntil late 2014, after revealing the information to his Government agency employer \nduring a security clearance interview. SOR 1.b is based on Applicant\u2019s submission of a \nfraudulent letter to his Government Agency employer claiming a debt had been settled. \nApplicant failed to timely inform the Government agency of the fraud after learning the \nletter was fraudulent.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s children attended a small private school. Since the school was small \nand private, the school administration enlisted parents to use their expertise to assist \nwith needs in the school. Applicant volunteered to assist with information technology \nand computer repair because of his expertise. In early 2008, he started to fix laptop \ncomputers used by the students that were not working properly. By the time the school \nyear was ending in the summer of 2008, he had repaired and returned to the school all \nbut three of the computers. Since school was not in session, he could not return the \nthree remaining computers. Applicant put them in a safe place in his house where the \ncomputers could not be accessed by any of his five children with the intent of returning \nthem to the school in September. They were out of sight and out of mind and he lost \ntrack of them. (Tr. 47-48) \n \n\n3 \n \nApplicant\u2019s family moved in 2009. Someone, not Applicant, packed up the items \nin the basement for the move. In the winter of 2011, he was helping to unpack some \nmoving boxes and discovered the laptops. He was very busy at the time with his job and \ntraveling so he did not have time to contact the school to let them know he had the \ncomputers. He finally contacted the school headmaster in 2014 after the issue was \nraised during a polygraph examination for his security clearance. Based on guidance \nfrom the headmaster, Applicant disposed of the computers. During the entire time he \npossessed the computers, Applicant did not have an intent to appropriate or use the \ncomputers for his or his family\u2019s purposes. During the time he had the computers, the \nschool never made any inquiry concerning the computers. (Tr. 48-51, 82-85)  \n \nApplicant stated at the hearing that the computers had never been used while in \nhis possession. However, the polygraph report states that Applicant told the polygraph \nexaminer that he used the laptops for his personal use. Applicant stated that the \npolygraph examiner was aggressive at that point in the interview and he thought by \nadmitting he used the computers, he could stop the examiner from being aggressive \nand he could relieve his stress. (Tr. 51-62; GX 2, Polygraph Report, dated June 20, \n2017) At the hearing, he denied actually using the laptops. He admitted the computers \nwere in his house but that they were out of sight, out of mind. (Tr. 63-64)  \n \nApplicant knew in early 2011 that he had a tax lien issue with his 2009 tax return. \nHe asked his wife to deal with and resolve the issue since she usually managed the \nfamily finances. She provided Applicant with documents in 2011 to establish that the \nissue had been dealt with and resolved. By the fall of 2012, Applicant realized that the \ndocuments his wife provided him concerning the tax lien were false. The tax lien was \nresolved. (Tr. 64-66) \n \nApplicant started processing his paperwork for a top level security clearance in \nNovember 2011. In January 2013, the security investigators for the first time requested \nthat he provide documents concerning a debt in collection that was reduced to a \njudgment by Capital Account for a dentist. (See, Response to SOR, RE: Email \nConfirmation, dated January 28, 2013) He asked his wife for the status of the debt. His \nwife provided him with a document from the dentist that the debt has been resolved. \n(AX H, Letter, dated May 22, 2012) Applicant\u2019s wife prepared the letter in an attempt to \nconvince Applicant that she resolved the debt. Even though his wife had previously \nprovided him with a false tax document, he only reviewed the letter from the dentist for \ncontent and not for authenticity. His wife stated that she was under emotional pressure \nat the time she prepared the false letter. She admitted that the letter was false and that \nApplicant had no role in preparing the letter. (Tr. 66-68; AX A, Receipt, dated March 10, \n2015) \n \nApplicant believed the letter to be genuine, and he had no reason to believe his \nwife would again provide him with a false document. However, the debt had not been \nsettled at that time. Since Applicant believed the letter to be genuine, he submitted it to \nthe security investigator. In late 2013, he decided for some reason to more closely \nscrutinize the letter. By early 2014, it was obvious to Appellant that the letter was \n\n4 \n \nfraudulent. He did not confront his wife with the idea that the letter was fraudulent \nbecause he thought she would deny the letter was fraudulent and the accusation would \nlead to conflicts within their household and marriage. At the time, he also did not \npresent the letter as fraudulent to his command or to the security investigators. The debt \nwas not settled until March 10, 2015. (Tr.68-73, 76-80; AX B, Affidavit, dated April 10, \n2018)  \n \nApplicant took no action on the fraudulent letter from January 2014 until October \n2014. He did not inquire into the status of the account or receive any correspondence \nfrom the creditor from the time he determined the letter was fraudulent and his \npolygraph examination in October 2014. He did not tell his command or security \ninvestigators of the fraudulent payment letter until the October 2014 polygraph \nexamination. He knew the letter had been submitted as part of the security clearance \nprocess and could have negative ramifications for his wife and is family. Instead of \ndoing what he should have done, he kept it to himself until he was to undergo the \npolygraph examination. During the polygraph examination, he initiated the discussion \nabout the fraudulent letter with the polygraph examiner. Applicant admitted his wife \ncreated the letter but he made the mistake of not reporting it. (Tr. 80-82) \n \nA coworker testified that he has known Applicant since at least 2011 when they \nworked together for their present employer. From 2011 until 2014, he saw Applicant \ndaily and served for a time as his supervisor. Since 2014, he sees him at least monthly \nat work and occasionally at social occasions. The witness stated that their employer has \nprocedures for an employee to report any mistakes they make. Applicant makes \nmistakes as any employee but he has a reputation as a person who acknowledges and \ntimely reports his mistakes. The witness understands the security concerns of the \nGovernment, and he recommends Applicant be granted a security clearance. The \nwitness also provided an affidavit in support of granting Applicant a security clearance \n(Tr. 27-32; AX C, Affidavit) \n \nA project manager for Applicant\u2019s employer testified that Applicant has worked \nfor her since July 2016. She also provided an affidavit in support of granting him a \nsecurity clearance. She has a good friendly working relationship with Applicant. \nApplicant is a good technical employee who delivers his work requirements on time or \nahead of schedule. She testified about an incident where data was copied to the wrong \nmedia, and Applicant immediately reported the breach and assisted in securing the \ndata. She also selected Applicant to work on a special security project. She opined that \nApplicant is trustworthy, hard-working, and technically competent. She has high regard \nfor Applicant\u2019s honesty and ability to understand and adhere to security rules. (Tr. 34-\n42; AX E, Affidavit) \n \nApplicant also introduced three letters of recommendation. The authors of the \nletters were aware of the Government security concerns. They have known Applicant \nfor a few years and worked with or supervise him. They wrote that Applicant is \ntrustworthy, honest, reliable, and demonstrates good judgment. He demonstrates good \ncharacter, patriotism, and a willingness to properly manage classified information. They \n\n5 \n \nall recommend that he be granted eligibility for access to classified information. (AX D, \nF, and G)  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the Administrative Guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. \nThe administrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and \ncommon sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by department counsel. . .\u201d The \napplicant has the burden of persuasion to obtaining a favorable security decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n6 \n \nAnalysis \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified and sensitive \ninformation. Personal conduct is always a security concern because it asks whether the \nperson\u2019s past conduct justifies confidence the person can be trusted to properly \nsafeguard classified or sensitive information. (AG \u00b6 15). \n \nApplicant\u2019s failure to timely return computers to his children\u2019s school after repair \ndoes not raise a security clearance concern. The incident did not raise an issue of \nquestionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules \nand regulations, or question his reliability, trustworthiness or his ability to protect \nclassified and sensitive information. The evidence clearly shows that Applicant merely \nforgot about the computers since they were clearly out of sight and out of mind. The \ncomputers were not used while they were under Applicant\u2019s control. As soon as he \nlearned that he had the computers in his possession, Applicant requested guidance \nfrom the school how to dispose of the computers. I find that SOR allegation 1.a was not \nestablished as a security concern and that allegation is found for Applicant. \nApplicant\u2019s failure, however, to timely report that a document he submitted during \nhis security clearance process was false raises the following disqualifying conditions \nunder AG \u00b616 (b) (deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing \nor omitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, security \nofficial, competent medical or mental health professional involved in making a \nrecommendation relevant to a national security eligibility determination, or other official \ngovernment representative.)  \n \nI considered the following Personal Conduct Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b617: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(b) the refusal to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused or \nsignificantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a person with \nprofessional responsibilities for advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning security processes Upon being made aware of the \nrequirement to cooperate or provide the information, the individual \ncooperated fully and truthfully;  \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n\n7 \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressor, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other appropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur. \n \nThe mitigating conditions do not apply. Applicant\u2019s wife drafted an erroneous \nreceipt for dental services for him to show during an update on his security clearance to \nestablish that the debt had been paid and resolved. Applicant had no role in drafting the \nerroneous receipt and did not know at the time he submitted it that it was a false \ndocument. Later, he became suspicious that the document was false because his wife \nhad previously provided him a false tax document. His wife\u2019s actions placed Applicant in \na dilemma. He had to choose between revealing his wife\u2019s action and the potential \nresulting consequences for her, and the requirement to be honest and truthful during the \nsecurity clearance process. He chose not to report the false document to his employer \nor the security officials until he knew the truth would surface during a polygraph \nexamination. He did not make a prompt good-faith effort to correct the concealment \nbefore he knew he would be confronted with the facts.  \n \nI take note that Applicant had a difficult decision to make. He either had to reveal \nhis wife\u2019s role in creating a false document or not report that he provided the security \nofficials with a false document. He chose not to walk on the side of protecting classified \ninformation but to hide his wife\u2019s role in creating the false document. In his requirement \nto protect classified or sensitive information, Applicant can very well face a similar \ndilemma. He must always resolve any issue on the side of protecting classified \ninformation. His decision not to revel the false document raises questions about his \njudgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. He failed to mitigate the personal conduct security \nconcern for not timely revealing that he used a false document. \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n\n8 \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \naccess to classified information must be an overall common-sense judgment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s over 20 \nyears of working for defense contractors while having access to classified information. \nApplicant\u2019s failure to timely report that he provided a false document during the security \nclearance process shows questionable judgement, untrustworthiness, unreliability, \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, and other characteristics to indicate \nthat he may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. Applicant was \nfaced with a dilemma and had to choose between his family obligations and his role to \nprotect classified information. He did not chose the path to protecting classified \ninformation. The facts in evidence do not mitigate any questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s judgment and his suitability for access to classified information. I conclude \nthat Applicant did not mitigate personal conduct security concerns. Eligibility for access \nto classified information is granted. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n_________________ \nTHOMAS M. CREAN \nAdministrative Judge \n",

She was administered a \nbreathalyzer and her BAC was .11%.5  \n \n \nApplicant was sentenced to 180 days with 150 suspended; probation for three \nyears; suspended driver\u2019s license for four months, then driver\u2019s license restriction for \nthree years with an interlock device installed on her car for six months; ordered to \nattend alcohol counseling and Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), and abstain from alcohol; \nand fined $700. She complied with the court\u2019s sentence. She served 15 days in jail; she \nsuccessfully completed probation; she did not consume any alcohol during her three-\nyear probation period; and she attended counseling once monthly and two AA meetings \nweekly for 36 weeks. She did not receive an alcohol diagnosis, but learned through \ncounseling how to handle her tendency to make decisions impulsively and how to \nexercise mindfulness.6 \n \n \nIn March 2015, Applicant was arrested and charged with probation violation, due \nto an alcohol reading registering on the interlock device installed on her car (SOR \u00b6 \n1.c). She denied that she consumed alcohol in violation of her probation. She testified \nthat she appeared in court to fight the charge, was found not guilty, and the court \nordered the removal of the interlock device, which was done in July 2015. She believed \nthat a court record reflecting that she was found guilty of the violation was an error. The \nsame record reflected that she did not receive a sentence from the court in connection \nwith this offense. She provided a copy of another court record reflecting that she was \nfound not guilty for the same offense, and the court ordered the removal of the interlock \ndevice in June 2015.7  \n \n \nApplicant testified that she resumed consuming alcohol in November 2016, when \nshe had a glass of wine with Thanksgiving dinner. She consumes one drink once \nmonthly, and testified that she does not have a compulsion to drink more. She has no \nfuture intentions of driving after drinking. On the occasions where she knows she will \nhave a drink and have to get home, she plans ahead and arranges for alternate \ntransportation. She attributed her heavy drinking in 2011 and 2013 to adjusting to life \n                                                     \n4 Tr. at 21-23, 38-40, 50-51; GE 1, 2, 3, 4; AE A. \n \n5 Tr. at 23-31, 34-35, 38, 40-49, 51; GE 1, 2, 3, 4; AE A, B. \n \n6 Tr. at 23-31, 34-35, 38, 40-49, 51; GE 1, 2, 3, 4; AE A, B. \n \n7 Tr. at 30-34, 51-58; GE 2, 4, 5; AE D. \n\n \n4 \n \nafter military retirement, her 2010 separation, and her subsequent divorce, while \nsimultaneously working and attending school. She testified, though, that she never felt \nshe abused alcohol, and her alcohol use did not negatively factor into her previous \nmarriage. She testified that other than a 2013 speeding ticket, her driving record is \nclean.8 \n \n \nApplicant indicated that her two DUIs are common knowledge. She testified that \nshe told her witness and her character reference about her DUIs. Her witness was her \nteam supervisor since 2015. He testified that he was aware that Applicant had at least \none DUI. He had never witnessed Applicant report to work under the influence of \nalcohol. He had occasions to observe her consume alcohol and did not witness her \nconsume irresponsibly. He also relied on her to serve as a designated driver for a fellow \nteam member several times between 2015 and 2018. He described Applicant as one of \nhis best analysts on a team of 23, and an exceptional worker. Her character reference \nwas her direct supervisor since March 2017. He wrote that he was \u201cextremely \nimpressed by [Applicant\u2019s] work ethic and reliability,\u201d and described her as a trustworthy \nindividual.9 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n                                                     \n8 Tr. at 22-30, 38, 42-45, 48-49, 51; GE 3. \n \n9 Tr. at 35-36, 56-72; GE 2; AE C. \n\n \n5 \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of Exec. Or. 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Exec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n \n \nThe security concern for alcohol consumption is set out in AG \u00b6 21: \n \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \n \nThe guideline notes conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 22. \nThe disqualifying conditions potentially applicable in this case include:   \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder;  \n \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder; and \n \n(g) failure to follow any court order regarding alcohol education, \nevaluation, treatment, or abstinence. \n \n \nApplicant has a pattern of excessive alcohol consumption and alcohol-related \nincidents.  AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a) and 22(c) are applicable. Applicant denied that she consumed \nalcohol in March 2015, in violation of her probation from her 2013 DWI conviction. She \nprovided a court record to corroborate her testimony that she was found not guilty of the \noffense, and that the court ordered the removal of the ignition interlock device installed \nas a result of the underlying DWI conviction. AG \u00b6 22(g) has not been established. \n\n \n6 \n \n \nAG \u00b6 23 provides the following conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment; and \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s excessive alcohol consumption and two DWI convictions occurred \nunder circumstances that are unlikely to recur. She was adjusting to life after military \nretirement, her 2010 separation, and her subsequent divorce, and simultaneously \nworking and attending school. She complied with the court\u2019s sentence for both \nconvictions, to include counseling once monthly for 36 weeks after her 2013 DWI \nconviction. Through such counseling, she learned how to handle her tendency to make \ndecisions impulsively and how to exercise mindfulness.  \n \n \nSince Applicant began consuming alcohol again in November 2016, she \nconsumes one drink once monthly, and she testified that she does not have a \ncompulsion to drink more. She has no future intentions of driving after drinking. On the \noccasions where she knows she will have a drink and have to get home, she plans \nahead and arranges for alternate transportation. Her witness testified that he has relied \non her to act as a designated driver for a fellow team member several times between \n2015 and 2018. I find that her two DWIs are not recent, are mitigated by the passage of \ntime, and do not continue to cast doubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, and \njudgment. She has also demonstrated a clear pattern of modified consumption. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n23(a) and 23(b) are applicable. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n\n \n7 \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline G in my whole-person analysis. Overall, the record evidence leaves me \nwithout questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. I conclude Applicant mitigated the alcohol consumption security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant  \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nCandace Le\u2019i Garcia \nAdministrative Judge \n",

(Item 3.) On August 4, 2017, the Department of \nDefense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DoD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement \nof Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline H (Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse). (Item 1.) The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the Department of Defense on June 8, \n2017.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing (Answer) on August 21, 2017, and \nrequested his case be decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. (Item 2.) A \ncomplete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) prepared by Department Counsel, \n\n \n \n \n \n \n2\nconsisting of Items 1 to 4, was provided to Applicant on September 7, 2017. Applicant \nreceived received the file on September 25, 2017.1 \n \n \nApplicant was given 30 days from receipt of the FORM to file objections and \nsubmit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. He submitted additional \ninformation in approximately November 2017. Department Counsel had no objection \nand the information is marked and admitted into evidence as Applicant Exhibit A. The \ncase was assigned to me on January 17, 2018. Based upon a review of the pleadings \nand exhibits, national security eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is 25 and single. He has a bachelor\u2019s degree and has been employed \nby a defense contractor since 2015. This is his first application for a security clearance. \nHe seeks to obtain national security eligibility for access to classified information in \nconnection with his employment. (Item 3 at Sections 12, 13A, and 25.) \n \nParagraph 1 (Guideline H \u2013 Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse) \n \n \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for \nclearance because he has used illegal drugs. Applicant admitted all the allegations \nunder this paragraph.  \n \n \n1.a. Applicant began using marijuana as a sophomore in college in November \n2012. He used it at least monthly until March 2017, two years after he began working for \na defense contractor. Applicant purchased marijuana during the period he was using it. \nApplicant stated in his Answer and in Applicant Exhibit A that he last used marijuana in \nMarch 2017. (See Item 3 at Section 23.) \n \n \nApplicant stated in Applicant Exhibit A that he has remained friends with people \nhe used marijuana with in the past. He stated, \u201cI believe I can still see these guys on an \noccasional basis and not use drugs again.\u201d  \n \n \n1.b. Applicant admitted using cocaine twice in his life. The first time was in 2012, \nand the second time was in 2015 about a month before he graduated from college. He \n                                            \n1 Department Counsel submitted four Items in support of the SOR allegations. Item 4 is inadmissible. It is \nthe summary of an unsworn interview of Applicant conducted by an interviewer from the Office of \nPersonnel Management on March 24, 2017. Applicant did not adopt the summary as his own statement, \nor otherwise certify it to be accurate. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.20, this Report of Investigation (ROI) \nsummary is inadmissible in the Government\u2019s case in chief in the absence of an authenticating witness. \n(See Executive Order 10865 \u00a7 5.) In light of Applicant\u2019s admissions, Item 4 is also cumulative. Applicant \nis not legally trained and might not have understood Department Counsel\u2019s FORM footnote 1, which \ndescribed the potential admissibility of Item 4. I therefor reviewed Item 4 for any potentially mitigating \ninformation that Applicant might have thought would be considered. Any such mitigating information will \nbe discussed later in this decision. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n3\nstated that he has not used cocaine since 2015, and does not intend to use cocaine in \nthe future. (Answer; Item 3 at Section 23.) \n \n \n1.c. Applicant admitted using hallucinogenic acid on a single occasion in \napproximately June 2016. This was about a year into his employment in the defense \nindustry. He stated that he was offered some acid at a music festival and used it on an \nexperimental basis. He does not intend to use acid in the future. (Answer; Item 3 at \nSection 23.) \n \n \n1.d. Applicant stated in Item 3 at Section 23 that he intended to continue to use \nmarijuana into the future. He also stated: \n \nI never had any intention of using marijuana after graduating college \nbecause of my career goals. For about the first year of being employed I \ndidn\u2019t use any drugs.2 Now that attitudes in the nation are changing \ntowards marijuana use I haven\u2019t really seen an issue in continuing \nsmoking weed. If having a security clearance would require me to stop \nthen I definitely would. \n \n \nIn his Answer, Applicant admitted making this statement. He further stated, \n\u201cHowever, since March of 2017, I have not used marijuana and I do not intend to use \nmarijuana while under consideration for and if granted a security clearance.\u201d \n \n \nFinally, in Applicant Exhibit A Applicant wrote, \u201cI would like to formally state that I \ndo not intend to use illegal drugs while under consideration for and in possession of a \nsecurity clearance.\u201d \n \n \nApplicant did not submit any evidence concerning the quality of his job \nperformance. He submitted no character references or other evidence tending to \nestablish good judgment, trustworthiness, or reliability. I was unable to evaluate his \ncredibility, demeanor, or character in person since he elected to have his case decided \nwithout a hearing. \n \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant=s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \napplicant=s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \n                                            \n2 Applicant also stated in Section 23 that he was using marijuana on a monthly basis up to September 20, \n2016, the date he completed the e-QIP. He did not reconcile this discrepancy. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n4\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, the administrative judge applies the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge=s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG & 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the Awhole-person concept.@ The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG & 2(b) \nrequires that, AAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of national security.@ In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record.  \n \nAccording to Directive & E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to \nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive & E3.1.15, \u201cThe \napplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, \nand has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance \ndecision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information.  \n \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of EO 10865, \u201cAny determination under this \norder adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified \nor sensitive information).   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n5\nAnalysis \n \nParagraph 1 (Guideline H \u2013 Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse) \n \n \nThe security concern relating to Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse is set \nforth in AG \u00b6 24: \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above.  \n \n \nI have examined the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 25 and especially \nconsidered the following: \n \n \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition);  \n \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia, and; \n \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \n \n \nApplicant has a history of using illegal drugs both before and after beginning \nwork in the defense industry. Applicant admitted using marijuana for about five years. \nHe also used cocaine and acid on an experimental basis. \n \n \nI have examined the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26 and especially \nconsidered the following: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment: \nand \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \n\n \n \n \n \n \n6\nproblem and has established a pattern of abstinences, including, but not \nlimited to: \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \n \n \nApplicant allegedly last used marijuana less than a year before the record closed \nin this case. While he stated twice that he would abstain from drug use in the future if \nrequired for national security eligibility, he continues to socialize with the friends with \nwhom he used multiple illegal drugs. There is no evidence from which to determine his \nreputation for truthfulness, or even that his employers know of his drug use history. \nApplicant has not mitigated the security significance of his recent drug use. Paragraph 1 \nis found against Applicant. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant=s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant=s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG & 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual=s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG & 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility and a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. Overall, the record evidence as \ndescribed above leaves me with questions and substantial doubts as to Applicant=s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance.

Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is granted.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn July 26, 2017, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline F, financial \nconsiderations. Applicant responded to the SOR on September 14, 2017, and \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on \nApril 4, 2019.  \n \nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing \non April 5, 2019, scheduling the hearing for May 30, 2019. The hearing was convened \nas scheduled. Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4 were admitted in evidence without \nobjection. Applicant testified and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through G, which \nwere admitted without objection. The record was held open for Applicant to submit \nadditional information. She submitted documents that I have marked AE H through P. \nDepartment Counsel did not object to the admission of AE H through P, but she \n\n \n2 \n \ncommented on the evidence. Department Counsel\u2019s e-mail is marked Hearing Exhibit \n(HE) I. Applicant responded to Department Counsel\u2019s comments in an additional e-mail \nthat I have marked AE Q. AE H through Q are admitted without objection.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 42-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has worked for \nher current employer since September 2018. She seeks to retain a security clearance, \nwhich she has held since about 2008. She is a high school graduate. She married in \n2016. She has two adult children and a child less than a year old. (Tr. at 17, 24-26, 29; \nGE 1) \n \n \nExcept for about a six-month period in 2013, Applicant was unemployed between \nSeptember 2012 and January 2015. She was raising her teenage children without the \nbenefit of child support, and she was taking care of an ill sister. Her sister passed away \nin 2015. Applicant and her mother paid for the funeral and burial expenses. Applicant \nand her mother own a home together and share the mortgage payments. Her mother \nworks ten months a year at a school. They spilt the mortgage payments for those ten \nmonths, and Applicant pays the full mortgage payments for the remaining two months. \nApplicant felt that she had to keep a roof over her children\u2019s head and she concentrated \non the mortgage loan while her car was repossessed and other debts went unpaid. (Tr. \nat 17-18, 39-40; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1: AE I, M) \n \n \nThe SOR alleges a charged-off deficiency balance of $16,323 owed on a car \nloan after the car was repossessed; a student loan that was $765 past due; five \ndelinquent medical debts totaling $1,307; and three miscellaneous delinquent debts \ntotaling $1,614. Except as addressed below, the allegations are established through \ncredit reports and Applicant\u2019s admissions. \n \n \nApplicant has made periodic payments toward the deficiency owed on the car \nloan (SOR \u00b6 1.a). She made payment arrangements with the creditor in August 2017 to \npay $50 per month. The balance then was $16,323. She made four $50 payments from \nAugust 2017 through November 2017; four $50 payments from February 2018 through \nMay 2018; a $25 payment in April 2019; and $50 payments in May 2019 and June \n2019. The payments total $525. The balance in June 2019 was $15,798. Applicant \nstated that the creditor is willing to accept a $3,000 lump-sum settlement, but she has \nbeen unable to afford to pay the amount requested. (Tr. at 19, 39-44; GE 2-4; AE A, F, \nI, Q) \n \n \nIn July 2017, Applicant was $765 past due on a student loan with a balance of \n$6,165 (SOR \u00b6 1.b). The loan was transferred to a student loan servicing company. The \nApril 2019 credit report shows that Applicant was current on her payments toward two \nstudent loans serviced by the company. The company approved Applicant\u2019s request for \nforbearance on the loans. The approval notice \u201cconfirms that [she is] willing but \ntemporarily unable to make payments due to financial hardship.\u201d Interest will continue to \naccrue, but Applicant is not required to resume payments until March 2020. (Tr. at 44-\n48; GE 2-4; AE I, N) \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant opened a credit card account in May 2016. The July 2017 credit report \nshows the date of last action was September 2016. It shows a charged-off balance of \n$1,111 (SOR \u00b6 1.c). She established that she made seven monthly $25 payments from \nNovember 2017 through April 2018; a $10 payment in May 2018; five $25 payments \nfrom June 2018 through October 2018; and three payments totaling $76 from April 2019 \nthrough June 2019. The payments total $386. The April 2019 credit report lists the \nbalance of the debt as $826, but that was before the most recent payments of $76 (Tr. \nat 20-21, 49-50; GE 2-4; AE I, L, P) \n \n \nThe February 2015 credit report lists a past-due telecommunications debt in \ncollections with a balance of $427. The July 2017 credit report lists the debt with a \nbalance of $49, which is the amount alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e. That indicates that Applicant \npaid $378 to the creditor between February 2015 and July 2017. Applicant paid $31 in \nMarch 2017 to pay the final amount owed on the debt. (Tr. at 19, 57; GE 2-4; AE D) \n \n \nThe February 2015 credit report lists a department store credit card opened in \nAugust 2007, with a date of last action of November 2008. It shows a charged-off \nbalance of $454 (SOR \u00b6 1.h). The account had been delinquent for almost nine years \nwhen the SOR was issued in July 2017. Applicant stated that she believed the account \nwas paid. It was not listed on credit reports from July 2017 and April 2019, likely \nbecause it was past the seven-year reporting window. Applicant contacted the creditor \nand was told the creditor showed the account with a zero balance. (Tr. at 58-60; GE 2-\n4; AE I) \n \n \nThe SOR alleged five medical debts totaling $1,307. The debts are all listed on \nthe July 2017 credit report. From August 2017 through May 2018, Applicant made \npayments totaling $367 to the company collecting the $558 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f. \nThe $298 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d is the only medical debt listed on the July 2017 \ncredit report. Applicant stated that she believes the medical debts are paid. None of the \nmedical debts are listed on the April 2019 credit report. (Tr. at 19, 51-58; GE 2-4; AE O) \n \n \nApplicant married in 2016. She pays the debts that she bought into the marriage; \nher husband pays the ones that he had; and they share responsibility for paying their \ncurrent bills. She stopped paying her older debts when she was on maternity leave from \nOctober 2018 through January 2019. She resumed her payments in April 2019. She has \nnot received formal financial counseling, but she stated that her finances are in better \nshape. Her husband is employed. They are able to pay their current bills while \ncontinuing to work on paying her older debts. In addition to her mortgage payments, she \nis paying $624 per month on a $28,625 car loan she took out in June 2017. She also \ncosigned the $13,830 car loan for her husband\u2019s car. He pays that loan. The debt \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c is the only delinquent account listed on her April 2019 credit \nreport. She credibly stated that she is committed to maintaining her finances in order \nand paying her debts. (Tr. at 24, 30-38, 44, 48-49, 60; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE \n2-4; AE I) \n \n \n \n\n \n4 \n \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n\n \n5 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \n \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:       \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, including delinquent debts and a \nrepossessed car. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \n \n  \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \n \n \nExcept for about a six-month period in 2013, Applicant was unemployed \nbetween September 2012 and January 2015. She was raising her teenage children \n\n \n6 \n \nwithout the benefit of child support, and she was taking care of an ill sister. Her sister \npassed away in 2015. Applicant and her mother paid for the funeral and burial \nexpenses. Those conditions were beyond her control. \n \n \nApplicant started slowly addressing her delinquent debts after she was \nemployed again in 2015. Most of the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e was paid before the \nSOR was issued in July 2017. She brought her student loans current before they were \nplaced in forbearance. She made payments towards the deficiency owed on the loan for \nher repossessed car, a credit card, and one or more medical debts. She credibly stated \nthat she is committed to maintaining her finances in order and paying her debts. \n \n  \nApplicant does not present a perfect case in mitigation, but a security clearance \nadjudication is not a debt-collection procedure. It is a procedure designed to evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. See ISCR Case No. 09-02160 \n(App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). An applicant is not required, as a matter of law, to establish \nresolution of every debt alleged in the SOR. An applicant need only establish a plan to \nresolve the financial problems and take significant actions to implement the plan. There \nis no requirement that an applicant make payments on all delinquent debts \nsimultaneously, nor is there a requirement that the debts alleged in the SOR be paid \nfirst. See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008).  \n \n \nApplicant still has several debts to resolve, and I note that she could have \npurchased a less expensive car in 2017. However, I also note that the most recent \naccount became delinquent in 2016, and she has not accrued any new delinquencies \nsince then. I believe she is honest and sincere in her intentions to address her debts. I \nfind that she has a plan to resolve her financial problems, and she took significant action \nto implement that plan. She acted responsibly under the circumstances and made a \ngood-faith effort to pay her debts. It may take time, but I am convinced that she will \neventually resolve her financial problems.1 The above mitigating conditions are \napplicable. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n                                                          \n1 See ISCR Case No. 08-06567 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct 29, 2009) and ISCR Case No. 09-08462 at 4 (App. Bd. \nMay. 31, 2011): \u201cDepending on the facts of a given case, the fact that an applicant\u2019s debts will not be paid \noff for a long time, in and of itself, may be of limited security concern.\u201d \n\n \n7 \n \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the financial considerations security concerns.2   \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.j: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nEdward W. Loughran \nAdministrative Judge \n                                                          \n2. The adjudicative guidelines give me the authority to grant conditional eligibility \u201cdespite the presence of \nissue information that can be partially but not completely mitigated, with the provision that additional \nsecurity measures shall be required to mitigate the issue(s).\u201d I have not done so as I have concluded the \nissues are completely mitigated, and it is unnecessary to further monitor Applicant\u2019s finances.  \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The SOR alleges under Guideline G, that Applicant was arrested and charged with driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI) in 2003, 2012, and 2016. It also alleges he continued to consume alcohol despite treatment in 2013 where he was diagnosed as alcohol dependent. Applicant admitted the allegations, with the explanation that he stopped drinking in March 2016, and completed a 32-day inpatient rehabilitation. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 52-year-old lead test technician, employed by a defense contractor since 2005. He completed high school and electronics technician school in 1986. He honorably served in the United States Marine Corps from 1988 to 2004, including deployments to Afghanistan. He married in 1988, separated in 2008, and divorced in 2010. He has two children, one of which passed away in 2016. He previously held a top secret security clearance. In 2003, Applicant was traveling from overseas to the U.S. for training. He was arrested for driving the wrong way on a one-way road while returning to his hotel after watching the Super Bowl. He was charged with DUI. His blood-alcohol content (BAC) was .24%. He pleaded guilty, was placed on one-year probation, fined, and ordered to perform community service. He was also referred to a military 30-day alcohol inpatient counseling program. He continued to drink and drive after separating from the Marine Corp",

The record was held open after the \nhearing to permit Applicant to submit additional documentary evidence in mitigation. \nApplicant submitted AE I, which was admitted without objection. DOHA received the \nhearing transcript (Tr.) on November 29, 2018.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline G, that Applicant was arrested and charged with \ndriving under the influence of alcohol (DUI) in 2003, 2012, and 2016. It also alleges he \ncontinued to consume alcohol despite treatment in 2013 where he was diagnosed as \nalcohol dependent. Applicant admitted the allegations, with the explanation that he \nstopped drinking in March 2016, and completed a 32-day inpatient rehabilitation. After a \nthorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following \nfindings of fact. \n \nApplicant is a 52-year-old lead test technician, employed by a defense contractor \nsince 2005. He completed high school and electronics technician school in 1986. He \nhonorably served in the United States Marine Corps from 1988 to 2004, including \ndeployments to Afghanistan. He married in 1988, separated in 2008, and divorced in \n2010. He has two children, one of which passed away in 2016. He previously held a top \nsecret security clearance. \n \n \nIn 2003, Applicant was traveling from overseas to the U.S. for training. He was \narrested for driving the wrong way on a one-way road while returning to his hotel after \nwatching the Super Bowl. He was charged with DUI. His blood-alcohol content (BAC) was \n.24%. He pleaded guilty, was placed on one-year probation, fined, and ordered to perform \ncommunity service. He was also referred to a military 30-day alcohol inpatient counseling \nprogram. He continued to drink and drive after separating from the Marine Corps in 2004. \n \n \nIn 2012, Applicant was arrested for DUI after he backed his car into another car \nand failed to stop. His BAC was .14%, and he was charged with DUI. He agreed to \nprobation and treatment before judgment. He attended a 26-day outpatient counseling, \nand the charge was dismissed. Applicant did not believe he had a drinking problem, but \nwas diagnosed as alcohol dependent in 2013. He was required to stop drinking during \nthe counseling period, but he continued to drink. From 2015 to 2016, Applicant was \ncounseled for being late to work and taking excessive Mondays off. \n \n \nIn 2016, Applicant was again stopped by police for traffic violations after drinking \non St. Patrick\u2019s Day. His BAC was .18% and he was arrested and charged with DUI. He \npleaded guilty, was sentenced to one-year probation, fined, and ordered to install an \nignition-interlock device on his car for one year. He successfully completed the probation \n\n \n3 \n \nand did not have any ignition-interlock violations. He attended Alcoholics Anonymous \n(AA) in 2016. \n \n \nAs a result of a desire to change his lifestyle, Applicant stopped drinking alcohol \non March 27, 2016. He realized on Easter morning, that he needed to stop drinking and \nshould have been in church services. He believed he was too weak to accomplish sobriety \non his own, so he attended a 32-day residential recovery and treatment program \n(including four extra days) with 24-hour monitoring, strict supervision, daily breathalyzer \ntests, and certified drug/alcohol counselors. No medications were prescribed. He also \nvoluntarily attended an additional 48-week outpatient aftercare program, which he \ncompleted in June 2017. Finally, he attended self-help meetings regularly, and was \nrequired to remain clean and sober. He stopped associating with friends with whom he \ndrank in the past, and attended a Mothers against Drunk Driving (MaDD) victim impact \npanel in February 2017. \n \n \nThe director of Applicant\u2019s counseling program noted that Applicant made great \nprogress in the program, was courteous, cooperative, compliant, and had demonstrated \na committed willingness to address his substance use issues. He attended all required \nsessions regularly and with punctuality, and engaged in all counseling sessions and \neducational seminars. He willingly took suggestions to keep his sobriety at the forefront, \nand remains in contact with his counselors, attends alumni meetings, and often visits with \nthe staff. He notes that Applicant has \u201ctruly embraced a lifestyle of recovery and \nexpressed his excitement for his recovery.\u201d He remains steadfast in his program and is \nexpected to remain clean and sober as long as he continues to put in the work. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor and coworkers have noted a change in Applicant after he \nstopped drinking. He was no longer taking Monday\u2019s off and borrowing vacation time, he \nrequested a change in schedule to allow him to focus on changing his lifestyle and \nmanage his home life, and has been a model employee. He is lauded for his positive \nattitude, reliability, and conscientiousness. Another coworker stated that Applicant was \nresponsible, honest and ethical, and was promoted to a group lead position since 2016. \nAnother coworker that has known Applicant for 13 years, attested to his struggles with \ndivorce and the loss of his child, but that he has remained alcohol free and continues to \nmaintain self-control. Finally, a long-standing friend who used to drink with Applicant, \ntestified that he has not seen him drink in the past two years.  \n \n \nApplicant testified that his family has struggled with alcoholism for many years. \nApplicant\u2019s brother and mother testified on his behalf. Applicant has been living with his \nbrother for five years. His brother has been sober since 1991, and has not seen Applicant \ndrink since March 2016. His mother sees Applicant about once per week. She testified \nthat Applicant used to spend time in bars, but now he stays away from them and has \nremained sober since 2016. She has seen big changes to his personality since he \nstopped drinking, and she can tell if he is drinking. He has helped others with alcohol \nproblems and she is very proud of him. She said the last counseling program was the \nbest thing that happened to him. He is now open and talkative rather than introverted; a \npleasure to be around. \n\n \n4 \n \nPolicies \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \n \nNational security eligibility is predicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria \ncontained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. \nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies \nthese guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider a person\u2019s stability, trustworthiness, reliability, \ndiscretion, character, honesty, and judgment. AG \u00b6 1(b). \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865  \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-01295 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2015). \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition,  \n \n\n \n5 \n \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01- \n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see, AG \u00b6 1(d). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concern for alcohol consumption: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \nAG \u00b6 22 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. Three are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder;  \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder;  \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional (e.g. \nphysician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical social \nworker) of alcohol use disorder; and \n(f) alcohol consumption, which is not in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations, after a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder. \n \nApplicant\u2019s drinking history comprising alcohol-related offenses, including after \ntreatment, meets the conditions set forth in AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a), (c), (d) and (f). \nI have also considered all of the mitigating conditions for alcohol consumption \nunder AG \u00b6 23, including: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \n\n \n6 \n \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment;  \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations; \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations. \n \nApplicant acknowledges his history of alcohol abuse and years of poor decision-\nmaking. He did not respond to counseling while in the military, and did not comply with \nthe recommendation to remain sober while undergoing the 2013 outpatient program. He \nwas diagnosed as alcohol dependent at that time, but did not acknowledge his problem \nuntil he had a third DUI arrest. After his 2016 DUI arrest, he finally acknowledged the \ndestructive path he was on, and his need for help. He chose to make a wholesale change \nto his lifestyle, renounce alcohol use completely, change the environment and friends \nwhere alcohol was used, and attend a sustained inpatient and outpatient treatment \nprogram. As a result, he stopped drinking in March 2016, remained sober, actively \nparticipated in his treatment program, and completed his probation, a MaDD panel, and \nignition-interlock program. \n \n \nHe now has a tremendous support network of family, counselors, friends, and co-\nworkers. His work performance and reliability have drastically improved, and he is lauded \nfor his responsibility, honesty and integrity. He continues counseling as needed and has \na positive prognosis as long as he remains abstinent. I find that sufficient time has passed \nsince his last alcohol-related incident and despite previous failed counseling, he has \nmaintained abstinence from alcohol since 2016. I am persuaded he will continue his \nlifestyle changes, counseling, and abstinence. His actions since 2016 have served to \nmitigate his past behavior. His alcohol abuse is finally behind him, and further lapses in \njudgment due to alcohol are unlikely to recur.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s alcohol-related issues appear to be under control, and no longer cast \ndoubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment as long as he maintains \ncompliance with his treatment regiment including complete abstinence from alcohol. I find \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 23(a) and (b) apply, and (c) and (d) substantially apply. \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.       \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s military service, \nstellar work performance over the past two years, and his alcohol-abuse treatment and \nfollow-on care through active participation in counseling and his abstinence from alcohol \nsince 2016. Although Applicant has significantly struggled with his behavior when drinking, \nhe appears to be on the right track. I am convinced that Applicant has sincerely changed \nhis behavior, has learned from his past transgressions, benefited from treatment, his \nsupport network and the use of the ignition-interlock device, and is committed to life-long \nsobriety. Overall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n    \n                        \n                      \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nGregg A.

Applicant\u2019s admissions and comments are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact: Applicant is a 49-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has been serving as a provisioning specialist with her current employer in three different geographical locations since April 2005. A 1987 high school graduate, Applicant attended a community college for three months in 2002, but she did not earn a degree. She enlisted in the U.S. Air Force in June 1987, and served on active duty until February 1996, when she was honorably discharged. She was first granted a secret clearance in 1987, and it was renewed in 2005. Applicant has never been married. She has two children, born in 1993 and 1995. 3 Financial Considerations1 It is unclear when Applicant first started having financial difficulties, although in her 2005 e-QIP she identified some accounts that had been delinquent since 2001.

De Angelis, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nGALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns regarding financial considerations \nand personal conduct. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn October 24, 2005, and again on March 14, 2011, as well as on December 2, \n2015, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted Electronic Questionnaires \nfor Investigations Processing (e-QIP) versions of a Security Clearance Application. On \nAugust 4, 2017, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued her a set of \ninterrogatories. Applicant responded to those interrogatories on November 6, 2017. On \nSeptember 4, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to her, under Executive Order (Exec. \nOr.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive); and \nDirective 4 of the Security Executive Agent (SEAD 4), National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines (December 10, 2016) (AG), for all covered individuals who require initial or \n03/14/2019\n\n \n2 \n                                      \n \ncontinued eligibility for access to classified information or eligibility to hold a sensitive \nposition, effective June 8, 2017. \n \n The \nSOR \nalleged \nsecurity \nconcerns \nunder \nGuidelines \nF \n(Financial \nConsiderations) and E (Personal Conduct) and detailed reasons why the DOD \nadjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to \ngrant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. The SOR recommended referral to \nan administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, \ndenied, or revoked.  \n \n \nIt is unclear when Applicant received the SOR as there is no receipt in the case \nfile. In a sworn statement, dated September 27, 2018, Applicant responded to the SOR \nand elected to have her case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. A complete \ncopy of the Government\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) was mailed to Applicant by \nDOHA on January 14, 2019, and she was afforded an opportunity after receipt of the \nFORM to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. In \naddition to the FORM, Applicant was furnished a copy of the Directive as well as the \nAdjudicative Guidelines applicable to her case. Applicant received the FORM on January \n22, 2019. Applicant apparently chose not to respond to the FORM, for as of March 8, \n2019, she had not done so. The case was assigned to me on March 8, 2019.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with comments, all of the factual \nallegations pertaining to financial considerations in the SOR (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.n.), \nand the factual allegation pertaining to personal conduct in the SOR (SOR \u00b6 2.a.). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and comments are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a \ncomplete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration \nof same, I make the following additional findings of fact:  \n \nApplicant is a 49-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has been serving \nas a provisioning specialist with her current employer in three different geographical \nlocations since April 2005. A 1987 high school graduate, Applicant attended a community \ncollege for three months in 2002, but she did not earn a degree. She enlisted in the U.S. \nAir Force in June 1987, and served on active duty until February 1996, when she was \nhonorably discharged. She was first granted a secret clearance in 1987, and it was \nrenewed in 2005. Applicant has never been married. She has two children, born in 1993 \nand 1995.  \n \n \n \n\n \n3 \n                                      \n \nFinancial Considerations1 \nIt is unclear when Applicant first started having financial difficulties, although in her \n2005 e-QIP she identified some accounts that had been delinquent since 2001. Her \nDecember 2005 credit report also lists a number of delinquent accounts that became \ndelinquent in 2001. Applicant identified only three factors that she attributed to her \nfinancial difficulties: she is the single mother of two children; she was unemployed for \nnearly a full year in 2001; and she has exhibited poor management and made poor \nfinancial decisions (including supporting a family that resided with her).2 The record refers \nto one period of unemployment, starting in May 2001, and lasting until October 2001, as \nwell as one period of under-employment with the state department of social and health \nservices, providing day-care services, starting in October 2001, and lasting until August \n2002. Applicant claimed to have either set up payment plans or intended to do so with \nseveral creditors or collection agents; claimed to be making monthly payments on some \naccounts; and intended to have all of her delinquent debts resolved by the end of 2006.3  \nIn her December 2015 e-QIP, Applicant acknowledged only one continuing \nfinancial issue, identified as unpaid federal income tax for the tax year 2010, but indicated \nthat she was working with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) on a payment plan.4 \nApplicant apparently had insufficient funds to cover all of her monthly bills, and accounts \nbecame delinquent. Some accounts were charged off, and two judgments were filed \nagainst her. Applicant\u2019s wages were garnished in 2011, but it is unclear as to which \ncreditor the garnishment was associated. Applicant also failed to timely file her federal \nincome tax returns over a multi-year period, essentially claiming that she did so because \nshe knew she owed tax because of insufficient withholding and insufficient funds to pay \nher 2010 taxes,5 and she now owes a substantial sum of unpaid taxes to the IRS. \n                                                          \n1 General source information pertaining to the financial accounts discussed below can be found in \nthe following exhibits: Item 8 (Combined Experian and TransUnion Credit Report, dated December 1, 2005); \nItem 9 (Combined Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax Credit Report, dated April 1, 2011); Item 10 \n(Combined Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax Credit Report, dated January 22, 2016); Item 11 (Equifax \nCredit Report, dated July 3, 2017); Item 12 (Equifax Credit Report, dated January 2, 2019); Item 7 \n(Enhanced Subject Interview, dated December 19, 2016); Item 4 (e-QIP, dated October 24, 2005); Item 5 \n(e-QIP, dated March 14, 2011); Item 6 (e-QIP, dated December 2, 2015); and Item 3 (Answer to SOR, \ndated September 27, 2018). \n \n2 Item 4, supra note 1, at 39; Item 3, supra note 1, at 4. \n \n3 Item 4, supra note 1, at 35-40. \n \n4 Item 6, supra note 1, at 30-32. \n \n             5 The legal requirement to file a federal income tax return is based upon an individual\u2019s gross \nincome and other enumerated conditions. Once it is determined that there is an obligation to so file, the \nfollowing applies: \n \nAny person required under this title to pay any estimated tax or tax, or required by this title \nor by regulations made under authority thereof to make a return, keep any records, or \nsupply any information, who willfully fails to pay such estimated tax or tax, make such \nreturn, keep such records, or supply such information, at the time or times required by law \nor regulations, shall, in addition to other penalties provided by law, be guilty of a \n\n \n4 \n                                      \n \nApplicant did not discuss the reasons for her subsequent failures to timely file her federal \nincome tax returns for the tax years 2011 through 2015. There is no evidence that \nApplicant ever received financial counseling. \nIn addition to unfiled federal income tax returns covering the tax years 2010 \nthrough 2015; $43,237 in unpaid taxes owed to the IRS; and a garnishment of $3,989 in \nwages, the SOR identified seven delinquent accounts that had been placed for collection, \ncharged off, or reduced to judgments as generally reflected by Applicant\u2019s five different \ncredit reports. Those seven debts, total approximately $2,690. There are also \napproximately one dozen delinquent debts that were not alleged in the SOR.6  Although \nApplicant has repeatedly promised that she would address her delinquent debts within \ncertain stated time frames, she has offered little documentation to indicate that: she has \ncontacted her creditors or collection agents to negotiate payment plans; established \npayment plans; made payments in an effort to resolve any delinquent debts; or actually \npaid off any of her debts. The sole exceptions were her entering into two installment \nagreements in 2013 and 2016 with the IRS with respect to her federal income taxes for \nthe tax year 2010, and the cancellation of those agreements associated with Applicant\u2019s \nfailures to remain in compliance with them, and her request to the IRS for tax transcripts \ncovering the tax years 2010 through 2015, on November 7, 2017.7  \nAmong the federal income tax returns that Applicant failed to timely file were: the \nincome tax return for the tax year 2010, which was eventually filed in February 2012, for \nwhich there was an unpaid balance of approximately $6,745, and only one payment was \nmade for $100 in June 2012 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. and 1.f.);8 the income tax return for the tax year \n                                                          \nmisdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be fined not more than $25,000 \n($100,000 in the case of a corporation), or imprisoned not more than 1 year, or both, \ntogether with the costs of prosecution. In the case of any person with respect to whom \nthere is a failure to pay any estimated tax, this section shall not apply to such person with \nrespect to such failure if there is no addition to tax under section 6654 or 6655 with respect \nto such failure.

While most of \nthe federal income tax returns were eventually filed, Applicant still owes a substantial sum \nto the IRS. These accounts have not been resolved, and there is little evidence that they \nwill soon be in the process of being resolved. \nIn addition to the unpaid federal income taxes, the SOR listed seven delinquent \naccounts. Those debts, none of which have been addressed or resolved by Applicant \nsince her December 2016 interview with an investigator with the U.S. Office of Personnel \nManagement (OPM), or since her SOR was issued in September 2018, are described as \nfollows: a charge account with an unpaid balance of $904 that was charged off (SOR \u00b6 \n1.g.); an unspecified type of account with an unpaid balance of $436 that was purchased \nfrom the original creditor (SOR \u00b6 1.h.); a cable television or Internet account with an \nunpaid balance of $305 (SOR \u00b6 1.i.); a cellular telephone account with an unpaid balance \nof $239 (SOR \u00b6 1.j.); a medical account with an unpaid balance of $74 (SOR \u00b6 1.k.); an \nunspecified type of account with an unpaid balance that was reduced to a judgment for \n$149 (SOR \u00b6 1.l.); and an apartment lease with an unpaid balance that was reduced to a \njudgment for $583 in 2009 (SOR \u00b6 2.m.).  \nIt is not known what Applicant\u2019s current financial resources may be because she \ndid not report her current net monthly income; monthly expenses; and any monthly \nremainder that might be available for discretionary spending or savings. There is no \nevidence of a budget.

Her failure in this \nregard is unalleged conduct, as it was not alleged in the SOR. \n \nOn December 2, 2015, when Applicant completed her e-QIP, she responded to \ncertain questions pertaining to her financial record found in Section 26. Some of those \nquestions asked if, in the past seven years, she had defaulted on any type of loan; had \nbills or debts turned over to a collection agency; had any account or credit card \nsuspended, charged off, or cancelled for failing to pay as agreed; and been over 120 days \ndelinquent on any debt not previously entered; as well as if she is currently over 120 days \ndelinquent on any debt? Applicant answered \u201cno\u201d to all of those questions, and certified \nthat her responses were \u201ctrue, complete, and correct\u201d to the best of her knowledge and \nbelief.15 In fact, her answers were incorrect, for Applicant actually had delinquent \naccounts that clearly came within the scope of the questions asked.  \n \nThere was one other question in Section 26 that could have been cited in the SOR, \nbut for some reason it was not specifically cited: In the past seven years did she have a \njudgment entered against her? Applicant also answered \u201cno\u201d to that question.16 In her \nAnswer to the SOR, Applicant admitted that she had deliberately falsified the material \nfacts in her responses to the e-QIP inquiries, although she modified that admission by \nclaiming she misunderstood the question and was answering it based on her credit report \nat the time. Nevertheless, even though she claimed to now understand the question, she \nadmitted that she did falsify material facts.17 \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d18 As Commander in Chief, the President has \n                                                          \n14 It should be noted that the Appeal Board has indicated that promises to pay off delinquent debts \nin the future are not a substitute for a track record of paying debts in a timely manner and otherwise acting \nin a financially responsible manner.

The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to \ngrant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d19   \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \n \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \n \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d20 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish \na potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced \nsubstantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nhas the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation \nor mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.21  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.

Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d22  \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d23 Thus, nothing in this \ndecision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in \npart, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines \nthe President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.  In \nreaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, \nand based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing \ninferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:  \n      \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG 19:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;  \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n                                                          \n22 Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n23 See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \n \n\n \n9 \n                                      \n \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \nApplicant had seven delinquent accounts, totaling approximately $2,690, placed \nfor collection, charged off, or reduced to judgments; she failed to timely file federal income \ntax returns for the tax years 2010 through 2015; and she has unpaid federal income tax, \ntotaling approximately $43,237. Those delinquent accounts and unpaid federal income \ntaxes remain unaddressed and delinquent. The failure to timely file income tax returns \nhas security implications because:24 \n \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established governmental rules and systems. Voluntary \ncompliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002). As we \nhave noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is not directed at collecting \ndebts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By \nthe same token, neither is it directed toward inducing an applicant to file tax \nreturns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s \njudgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her \nlegal obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment \nand reliability required of those granted access to classified information. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). See \nCafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, \n183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). \n \nThe Appeal Board clarified that even in instances where an \u201c[a]pplicant has \npurportedly corrected [his or her] federal tax problem, and the fact that [applicant] is now \nmotivated to prevent such problems in the future, does not preclude careful consideration \nof [a]pplicant\u2019s security worthiness in light of [his or her] longstanding prior behavior \nevidencing irresponsibility\u201d including a failure to timely file federal income tax returns.25 In \nthis instance, while Applicant eventually filed her late federal income tax returns for \nseveral years, and she may now be properly motivated, she waited nearly one year after \nshe was interviewed by the OPM investigator to obtain information regarding her unpaid \ntaxes; and did not file her 2015 federal income tax return until three weeks after the SOR \nwas issued. There is still no evidence that her 2012 federal income tax return has been \nfiled. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), and 19(f) have been established. As there is no evidence that \n                                                          \n24 ISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016) (emphasis in original).

Sept. 13, 2016)). \n \n27 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant must \npresent evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some \nother good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not \ndefine the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-\nfaith \u2018requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, \nhonesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 Accordingly, an applicant must do more than \nmerely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as bankruptcy [or \nstatute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition].  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd.

The nature, frequency, and recency of Applicant\u2019s continuing financial difficulties \nmake it difficult to conclude that it occurred \u201cso long ago\u201d or \u201cwas so infrequent,\u201d or that it \nis \u201cunlikely to recur.\u201d Applicant identified only three factors that she attributed to her \nfinancial difficulties: she is the single mother of two children; she was unemployed for \nnearly a full year in 2001; and she has exhibited poor management and made poor \nfinancial decisions (including supporting a family that resided with her). The record refers \nto one five-month period of unemployment in 2001, as well as one ten-month period of \nunder-employment in 2001-2002. Applicant has had 18 years to resolve her financial \nissues, but with the exception of one garnishment in the amount of $3,989, three minimal \nincome tax payments, totaling $111, and two aborted attempts to comply with installment \nagreements with the IRS, her resolution efforts have been non-existent.  \nClearance decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines do not \nrequire an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the SOR. An \napplicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant \nactions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant immediately \nresolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a \nrequirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. Rather, a \nreasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such debts, or \nresolution of such issues, one at a time. Mere promises to pay debts in the future, without \nfurther confirmed action, are insufficient. In this instance, to date, there is little evidence \nthat any corrective actions have been taken by Applicant. There is no evidence to \nconclude that Applicant\u2019s finances are under control. Applicant\u2019s actions under the \ncircumstances continue to cast doubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment.28 \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \n                                                          \n28 See ISCR Case No. 09-08533 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2010). \n \n\n \n12 \n                                      \n \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \n \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or \ncooperate with security processing, including but not limited \nto meeting with a security investigator for subject interview, \ncompleting security forms or releases, cooperation with \nmedical \nor \npsychological \nevaluation, \nor \npolygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful \nquestions of investigators, security officials, or other official \nrepresentatives in connection with a personnel security or \ntrustworthiness determination. \n \nThe guideline notes a condition that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 16:  \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts \nfrom any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, \nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \nAs noted above, in December 2015, when Applicant completed her e-QIP, she \nresponded to certain questions pertaining to her finances found in Section 26. Some of \nthose questions asked if, in the past seven years, she had defaulted on any type of loan; \nhad bills or debts turned over to a collection agency; had any account or credit card \nsuspended, charged off, or cancelled for failing to pay as agreed; and been over 120 days \ndelinquent on any debt not previously entered; as well as if she is currently over 120 days \ndelinquent on any debt? Applicant answered \u201cno\u201d to all of those questions, and certified \nthat her responses were \u201ctrue, complete, and correct\u201d to the best of her knowledge and \nbelief. In fact, her answers were incorrect, for Applicant actually had delinquent accounts \nthat clearly came within the scope of the questions asked.  \n \nIn her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted that she had deliberately falsified \nthe material facts in her responses to the e-QIP inquiries, although she modified that \nadmission by claiming she misunderstood the question and was answering it based on \nher credit report at the time. Nevertheless, even though she claimed to now understand \nthe question, she admitted that she did falsify material facts. \n \nApplicant\u2019s comments provide sufficient evidence to examine if her submission \nwas a deliberate falsification, as alleged in the SOR, or merely an inaccurate answer that \nwas the result of oversight or misunderstanding of the true facts on his part. Proof of \nincorrect answers, standing alone, does not establish or prove an applicant\u2019s intent or \nstate of mind when the falsification or omission occurred. As an administrative judge, I \nmust consider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is a direct or \ncircumstantial evidence concerning Applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the \n\n \n13 \n                                      \n \nalleged falsification or omission occurred. I have considered the entire record, including \nApplicant\u2019s initial and subsequent comments.29 \nThe December 2015 e-QIP asked the same questions that Applicant was asked in \nher October 2005 and March 2011 e-QIPs. In 2005, Applicant responded appropriately \nto the questions, citing several different financial issues, and indicating her plans for \naddressing them. In 2011, although there were continuing financial issues, Applicant \nlacked candor, and she denied any such issues. Her failure in this regard is unalleged \nconduct as described above. In 2015, faced again with the same inquiries, Applicant \nsimply listed her 2010 income tax issue, but denied the other financial delinquencies. In \nlight of Applicant\u2019s familiarity with the e-QIP, her lengthy history of financial difficulties \ninvolving routine delinquent commercial accounts and her federal income tax issues, and \nher admission that she deliberately falsified her responses, notwithstanding her claimed \nmisunderstanding the question, AG \u00b6 16(a) has been established. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions under AG \u00b6 17 that could \nmitigate security concerns arising from personal conduct. They include: \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress; \n \nNeither of the mitigating conditions apply. Applicant\u2019s pattern of behavior, including \nher e-QIP denials, both alleged and not alleged in the SOR; and her denial to the OPM \ninvestigator in 2016 that she had any delinquent accounts, until she was confronted with \na number of such accounts, also unalleged conduct, reflect a general lack of candor that \nis not minor or infrequent, and it does not occur under unique circumstances. \nFurthermore, Applicant has not taken any positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. Applicant\u2019s actions under the \n                                                          \n29 The Appeal Board has cogently explained the process for analyzing falsification cases, stating: \n \n(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has the burden of \nproving falsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove \nan applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the omission occurred; and (c) a Judge must \nconsider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or \ncircumstantial evidence concerning the applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the \nomission occurred. [Moreover], it was legally permissible for the Judge to conclude \nDepartment Counsel had established a prima facie case under Guideline E and the burden \nof persuasion had shifted to the applicant to present evidence to explain the omission.  \n \nISCR Case No. 03-10380 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 6, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-23133 (App. Bd. June 9, \n2004)). See also ISCR Case No. 08-05637 at 3 (App. Bd. Sept. 9, 2010) (noting an applicant\u2019s level of \neducation and other experiences are part of entirety-of-the-record evaluation as to whether a failure to \ndisclose past-due debts on a security clearance application was deliberate).  \n \n\n \n14 \n                                      \n \ncircumstances continue to cast doubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis.30   \nThere is very little evidence mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct. Applicant is a 49-year-\nold employee of a defense contractor, and she has been serving as a provisioning \nspecialist with her current employer since April 2005. A 1987 high school graduate, \nApplicant attended a community college for three months in 2002, but she did not earn a \ndegree. She enlisted in the U.S. Air Force in June 1987, and served on active duty until \nFebruary 1996, when she was honorably discharged. She was first granted a secret \nclearance in 1987, and it was renewed in 2005. Although Applicant failed to timely file her \nfederal income tax returns for a multi-year period, she eventually filed most of them, well \nafter the required filing dates. \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is simply more \nsubstantial. Applicant had seven delinquent accounts, totaling approximately $2,690, \nplaced for collection, charged off, or reduced to judgments; she failed to timely file federal \nincome tax returns for the tax years 2010 through 2015; and she has unpaid federal \nincome tax, totaling approximately $43,237. There are also approximately one dozen \ndelinquent debts that were not alleged in the SOR.  Applicant made arrangements on two \noccasions with the IRS to establish installment agreements with respect to her 2010 \nfederal income taxes, but both agreements were cancelled because of her failure to \nremain in compliance with the arrangements. All of those delinquent accounts, both \n                                                          \n30 See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-\n3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006). \n \n\n \n15 \n                                      \n \nalleged and non-alleged, and the unpaid federal income taxes remain unaddressed and \ndelinquent. There is still no evidence that she has filed her federal income tax return for \nthe tax year 2012. Applicant has displayed a lengthy pattern of a lack of candor. She has \nrepeatedly denied having delinquent accounts when in fact there were some. It is now \nmid-March 2019, and Applicant has shown little voluntary efforts to address her delinquent \ndebts. Applicant\u2019s current financial situation is unknown. Considering the lack of evidence \nregarding her current finances, I am unable to reach a positive conclusion pertaining to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \nThe Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in \nfinancial cases stating:31 \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d necessarily includes evidence of actual \ndebt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not \nrequired, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off each \nand every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he [or she] has \u201c. . . established a plan to resolve his [or \nher] financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d \nThe Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the extent to which that \napplicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible \nand realistic. See Directive \u00b6 E2.2(a) (\u201cAvailable, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be \nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u201d) There is no requirement that a \nplan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, \na reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment \nof such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first \ndebts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones \nlisted in the SOR. \n \nApplicant has demonstrated an extremely poor track record of debt reduction and \nelimination efforts, failing to take any substantial corrective actions with respect to her \ndelinquent debts. Paying only $111 over a multi-year period on an unpaid balance of \n$43,237 in federal income taxes, as well as having her wages garnished in the amount of \n$3,989, does not qualify as a good-faith effort to resolve debts. Overall, the evidence \nleaves me with substantial questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability \nfor a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I conclude Applicant has failed to \nmitigate the security concerns arising from her financial considerations and personal \nconduct. See SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d)(1) through AG 2(d)(9). \n \n \n \n                                                          \n31 ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd.

He has worked full time for a defense contractor since January 2007. From 2003 to 2017, Applicant had a second, part-time job with a different defense contractor. In or about May 2009, he began working for his current employer and security clearance sponsor. He received his first security clearance in June 2004. His clearance was renewed in 2010 or 2011.

Eligibility for access to classified information \nis denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn September 21, 2017, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) sent Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security \nconcerns under Guidelines F and E. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended \n(Exec. Or.); DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated in Security Executive Agent Directive 4, National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines (December 10, 2016), for all adjudicative decisions on or after \nJune 8, 2017. \nOn November 11, 2017, Applicant, through his counsel at the time, responded to \nthe SOR. Applicant requested a hearing before an administrative judge at the Defense \n02/15/2019\n\n \n2 \n \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). The attorney subsequently withdrew his \nappearance, and Applicant proceeded pro se. The case was originally assigned to \nanother administrative judge, and on July 17, 2018, it was reassigned to me. On June 21, \n2018, DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing scheduling the hearing on August 16, 2018. I \nconvened the hearing as scheduled. \n \nDepartment Counsel offered six exhibits into evidence, which I marked as \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1-6. These documents were previously mailed to Applicant\u2019s \nformer counsel, but he had not provided these documents to Applicant before he withdrew \nfrom the case. I adjourned the hearing for a period of time to give Applicant the opportunity \nto review the documents. After reviewing them, Applicant had no objection to the \nadmission of these exhibits. Applicant testified and offered five exhibits into evidence. I \nmarked his exhibits as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A-E. Absent an objection, I admitted all \nfive exhibits into the record. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on August \n24, 2018. (Tr. at 19-36.) \n \nFindings of Fact1 \n \n \nApplicant is 51 years old and works for a defense contractor. He married in 2004, \nand he separated from his wife in January 2016. He and his wife have no children, though \nhis wife has an adult son from a prior relationship. Applicant has no financial responsibility \nto his wife following their separation in January 2016. (GE 2 at 20; Tr. at 39-41, 44.) \n \nApplicant graduated from high school in 1985, and in May 2007, he received his \nbachelor\u2019s degree. He has worked full time for a defense contractor since January 2007. \nFrom 2003 to 2017, Applicant had a second, part-time job with a different defense \ncontractor. In or about May 2009, he began working for his current employer and security \nclearance sponsor. He received his first security clearance in June 2004. His clearance \nwas renewed in 2010 or 2011. He submitted a security clearance application on January \n20, 2016, (SCA) seeking the renewal of his top secret clearance. (GE 1; GE 2 at 20, 24; \nTr. 39, 44, and 48.) \n \nThe SOR contains nine allegations under Guideline F, eight of which involve \nApplicant\u2019s failure to pay federal and state taxes in 2014 and 2015 and state taxes in \n2013, as well as his failure to file federal tax returns in 2013, 2014, and 2015. Applicant\u2019s \ntotal federal and state tax debts are alleged to be about $32,000 for these years. He is \nalso alleged to owe $1,339 on a judgment obtained by the homeowners\u2019 association \n(HOA) where he lived with his wife from 2002 to 2016. In his SOR answer, Applicant \nadmitted all of the allegations except the HOA judgment. He also claimed that he owes \nsignificantly less in taxes than was alleged in the SOR and that he has filed amended \nreturns to support that position.  \n \n                                                          \n1 Applicant\u2019s personal information is extracted from his security clearance application, dated January 20, \n2016 (GE 1), unless otherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. \n\n \n3 \n \n \nIn August 2016, Applicant was arrested and charged with driving under the \ninfluence (DUI) and other related charges. He failed to report the arrest to his part-time \nemployer at the time, as required by the employer\u2019s rules. This was a major rules violation, \nand his employer terminated him on January 20, 2017. Under Guideline E, the SOR \nalleges Applicant\u2019s 2016 DUI arrest and his subsequent termination from his part-time \nemployment. Applicant admitted both allegations in his SOR answer. (GE 4 at 2; GE 2 at \n23.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, and 1.e: failure to pay federal income taxes in 2014 \nand 2015 in the approximate amount of $27,913 and failure to file federal income \ntax returns, as required, in 2013, 2014, and 2015. In his January 2016 SCA, Applicant \ndisclosed that he failed to file his 2014 federal tax return because he owed taxes for that \nyear. He wrote that he was saving money every month so he could satisfy this obligation \nin 2015. His SCA, however, was signed on January 20, 2016. He testified that he had \noriginally prepared the SCA in 2015, and due to a technical problem, he had to resubmit \nthe SCA in 2016. (Tr. at 27.) \n \n \nIn response to the DOD CAF\u2019S April 2017 interrogatories, Applicant provided his \nInternal Revenue Service (IRS) tax account transcripts for the years 2013, 2014, and \n2015, which were dated June 5, 2017. The 2013 transcript shows that Applicant failed to \nfile a tax return for that year. The 2014 transcript shows that the return was filed late on \nApril 24, 2017, and that Applicant owed about $15,500. The 2015 transcript shows that \nthe return was filed late on May 29, 2017, and that Applicant owed approximately $20,490. \n(GE 2 at 8-10.)  \n \n \nIn his January 2017 background interview, Applicant explained that prior to 2014, \nhe and his wife filed jointly, but in 2015, she advised him that she wanted to file separately. \nHe said that because of this change, he failed to file his 2014 and 2015 tax returns. \nApplicant advised the investigator that he believed he owed taxes. He said that he had \nnot yet done anything about his taxes, but he intended to work with a friend, who is a tax \naccountant, to file his returns. He also said he intended to make payment arrangements \nwith the IRS. (GE 2 at 24.) \n \n \nAt the hearing, Applicant testified that later in 2017, he consulted his tax \naccountant friend and the accountant filed amended returns for those two years and filed \nthe missing 2013 return. He explained that prior to 2013, he and his wife had previously \nworked together with a large tax preparation company to prepare and file their tax returns. \nStarting in 2013, his mother and sister became seriously ill and he was busy taking care \nof them. He also blamed his tax delinquencies on his marital problems with his wife. He \nfailed to work with his tax preparer that year. He did not contact a tax accountant until \n2017. During the three years in question, which was before his January 2016 separation \nfrom his wife, he also stopped taking any deductions on his family home. Instead he let \nhis wife take these deductions on her separate returns. Applicant claimed that his failure \nto file for three years was not due to the fact that he knew he owed money and was not \nin a position to pay the taxes at the time.(Tr. at 67-73; 78, 83, 90, and 106.) \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nAt the hearing, Applicant introduced into evidence updated IRS tax account \ntranscripts, dated August 15, 2018. These transcripts show that Applicant filed his 2013 \ntax return on September 11, 2017, and owed $8,572. The reason he owed more taxes \nwas due to his change in his tax filing status and his failure to adjust his withholding after \nreceiving an increase in his income. He testified that he has never changed his \nwithholding. The updated 2014 transcript reflects that Applicant filed an amended return \non November 7, 2017, and that he had no balance due as a result of credits for his refunds \nfrom 2016 and 2017 and certain other adjustments. Similarly, the updated 2015 transcript \nreflects that Applicant filed an amended return on November 20, 2017, and that after \ncertain adjustments and a small credit from his 2017 refund, Applicant only owed $5,008. \n(Tr. at 73-84; AE A, B, and C.) Accordingly, Applicant\u2019s total tax debt for 2013 and 2015 \nis approximately $13,580, as of August 15, 2018, based upon Applicant\u2019s amended \nreturns. \n \n \nApplicant admitted at the hearing that the IRS had not fully accepted the numbers \nin the amended returns, and therefore, the Service has not given him a final number \nrepresenting his total tax liability for the 2013-2015 period. As a result, he has not \ncommenced paying his federal tax debt on a payment plan. He blamed the 2017 amended \nreturns for the delay. Applicant has not received any financial counseling in connection \nwith his tax indebtedness or more generally since 2013. (Tr. at 86, 95-96, and 109.) His \nfederal tax debt is not resolved, though he ultimately filed his tax returns for 2013-2015 in \n2017. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f, 1.g, and 1.h: failure to pay state income taxes in 2013, 2014, and \n2015 in the total amount of $4,088. As noted, Applicant disclosed in his SCA his failure \nto file his state tax return for 2014. The Government\u2019s evidence includes state tax \ncomputation notices, dated May, June, and July 2017, for the years 2014, 2015, and \n2013, respectively. Applicant testified that these dates in 2017 are the dates he filed his \nstate tax returns. Applicant provided these documents in response to the Government\u2019s \ninterrogatories. They reflect Applicant owes state taxes for 2013 in the amount of $1,889. \nFor 2014, the record evidence shows that he owes $861, and for 2015, he owes $1,900. \nAs of mid-2017, Applicant\u2019s total state tax debt was approximately $4,650. (Tr. at 84-94.) \n \n \nAt the hearing, Applicant introduced into evidence a state installment tax bill, dated \nJuly 30, 2018, which reflected that his remaining balance was about $220 and that he \nowed an installment of about $94 on August 15, 2018. He testified that he commenced \npaying on his installment payment plan in approximately January 2018 and presently \nowes about $126. (AE D; Tr. at 93.) Applicant has resolved his state tax debt with \nconsistent monthly payments, though he filed his 2013-2015 state tax returns in 2017, \nlong after their due date. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.i: December 2016 judgment in favor of HOA in the amount of $1,339. \nAt the hearing, Applicant also introduced into evidence a court order quashing the HOA\u2019s \ngarnishment of his bank account and ordering the Garnishee bank to return all garnished \nfunds to Applicant. He testified that he was able to have the judgment and the \ngarnishment of his bank account vacated because he was never notified about the \n\n \n5 \n \nproceeding. Also, the home that was the subject of the HOA dues was solely the \nresponsibility of his wife and he had no obligation to pay these fees. The HOA judgment \nwas obtained against Applicant about 11 months after he left the home, and it was solely \noccupied by his wife and her son at that time. (Tr. at 98-100; GE 3.)  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.a: August 2016 DUI arrest and guilty plea to a lesser offense. \nApplicant admitted that he used poor judgment the night of his DUI arrest. He had \nconsumed two beers at a bar where he was listening to music and then he drove home \nwhen he was arrested. The police officer who stopped him said that he had swerved into \nanother lane. At the security clearance hearing, Applicant testified that he passed the field \nsobriety test following the traffic stop by the police, though in his background interview, \nhe admitted that he failed the test. He was then given a breathalyzer test and his BAC \nwas over the legal limit at 0.9 grams. He pleaded guilty to a reduced charge and received \nprobation before judgment in December 2016. He was given a one-year period of \nprobation, which he successfully completed. This arrest occurred after his January 2016 \nseparation from his wife. He believes that the sinus medication he was taking that night \nenhanced the effect of the alcohol he consumed. This was Applicant\u2019s second DUI arrest. \nThe first occurred in 1995 when he was 27. That arrest is not alleged in the SOR. He no \nlonger drinks and drives, and he spends his limited free time engaged in more \nconstructive activities. (Tr. at 52-54, 56-58, and 103.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.b: January 2017 employment termination for failing to report DUI \narrest in compliance with employer\u2019s security rules. With the consent of the parties, \nI amended the allegation in SOR \u00b6 2.b to correct a scrivener\u2019s error in the incorrect \nreference to the allegation in SOR \u00b62.a. Department Counsel also moved to amend this \nallegation to conform to the evidence that the employer\u2019s self-reporting policy required \nreporting within 12 hours of an arrest, not 12 days. With Applicant\u2019s consent, I granted \nthe Government\u2019s motion to amend this allegation, as noted. Applicant then entered his \nadmission to the modified allegation. (Tr. at 12-14.) \n \n \nApplicant testified that after the DUI court action was completed, he brought the \ncourt papers to his supervisor at his part-time employer and filled out a form disclosing \nthe arrest. The supervisor forwarded these documents to the \u201cfront office.\u201d He claimed \nthat he verbally reported the arrest and probation before judgment to his supervisor in or \nabout December 2016. He was told that he failed to report the arrest in a timely manner \nand was suspended pending an investigation. He was subsequently terminated for \nviolating the employer\u2019s policy after having worked there for ten years. Applicant testified \nthat he was unaware of the policy. He said that he notified the security officer at his full-\ntime employer shortly after his arrest and subsequently provided the court paperwork \nwhen his case was completed. Presently, Applicant only works at his full-time job. (GE 5 \nand 6; Tr. at 46, 58-67, 108.) \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\n \n6 \n \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n\n \n7 \n \n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, testimony and the documentary evidence in the record \nestablish the following potentially disqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) \n(\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d), AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d), \nand AG \u00b6 19(f) (\u201cfailure to file . . . annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns or \nfailure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required\u201d). \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \n\n \n8 \n \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indication that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant presented no evidence to support a \nconclusion that his financial irresponsibility with respect to his federal and state tax \nobligations are unlikely to recur or that this history of irresponsibility does not cast doubt \non his current reliability and judgment. Applicant\u2019s federal tax indebtedness has continued \nunresolved for years, and he still has no installment plan to begin paying his delinquent \nfederal taxes. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not established. Applicant\u2019s various family issues, though serious \nand largely beyond his control, should not have caused Applicant to fail to discharge his \nmost basic civic duty of filing his taxes on time. As evidenced by his recent filing of \namended returns, he had someone with tax expertise available to help him, and he failed \nto seek that help in a timely manner. Moreover, Applicant could not pay his taxes when \nthey were due, and his family problems were not the reason for this problem. He was \nworking two jobs, and he failed to withhold sufficient funds from his paycheck to cover his \ntax liabilities for three years. Also, his inability to pay his taxes when they were due does \nnot explain his failure to enter into payment plans to pay his taxes over time. In his January \n2016 SCA, he wrote that he was saving money in 2015 to pay his 2014 federal tax liability, \nbut that payment was not made. Although he has now paid his relatively small state tax \ndebt, he has failed to enter into a payment plan with the IRS. Applicant has not acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is partially established. Applicant has not received financial counseling. \nHe has resolved his state tax debt for 2013-2015 and the HOA judgment. His federal tax \ndebt, however, remains unresolved. The IRS has not even accepted his attempt to reduce \nhis taxes by filing amended tax returns for the years 2013-2015. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is partially established. Applicant has paid his state tax debt and has \nfiled his state and federal tax returns, though they were filed long after the mandatory \nfiling dates. He has not, however, initiated a payment plan to pay his significant federal \ntax debt. \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e) is fully established with respect to the HOA judgment alleged in SOR \n\u00b6 1.i. Applicant has documented that a civil court has entered an order validating \nApplicant\u2019s dispute of this debt. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(g) is partially established. Applicant has filed his federal and state tax \nreturns, though he did so long after the required filing deadlines. His untimely filings only \npartially mitigates this security issue. To his credit, Applicant entered into an installment \npayment plan to pay his relatively small state tax debt, and he has documented that he \npaid off those taxes. The most significant issue raised in his SOR is his substantial federal \ntax indebtedness. He has not made arrangements with the IRS to pay this debt. The fact \nthat the IRS has not accepted his amended returns is troubling. Applicant may end up \nbeing obligated to pay even more than the total amount owed according to his amended \nreturns, i.e., over $13,000. Due to his late filing of the amended returns and the IRS\u2019s \npossible disagreement with those returns, Applicant has not yet entered into a payment \nplan with the IRS, let alone establish a track record of consistently making payments \nunder such a plan. \n \nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) \n \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nThe following disqualifying condition under this guideline is potentially relevant: \n \nAG \u00b6 16(c): credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas \nthat is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information; and \n \nAG \u00b6 16(d): credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under \nany other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This \n\n \n10 \n \nincludes, but is not limited to, consideration of: . . . (3) a pattern of . . . rule \nviolations. \n \n \nApplicant second DUI arrest in August 2016 and his failure to follow his long-term \nemployer\u2019s \u201cmajor rules\u201d with respect to self-reporting security issues establishes the \nabove disqualifying conditions. \n \nThe only potentially applicable mitigating condition under Guideline E is the \nfollowing: \n \nAG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior \nis so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely \nto recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17(c) is not established. His part-time employer considered his violation of \nits self-reporting requirement to be sufficiently serious to warrant his suspension, an \ninvestigation, and ultimately, his termination. The violation was not minor. Insufficient time \nhas passed to conclude that similar rule violations are unlikely to recur. The violation casts \nserious doubt on his reliability and judgment. Even if Applicant was unaware of his \nemployer\u2019s self-reporting rules, it reflects poorly on his judgment that he did not try to \ndetermine when he must report the arrest to his employer\u2019s security officer. He held a top \nsecret clearance from the Defense Department and that carries with it a significant duty \nto act responsibly, especially in the area of self-reporting personal circumstances that \nraise possible security concerns. \n \n \nThe above is particularly concerning in light of Applicant\u2019s August 2016 DUI arrest. \nStanding alone, this criminal offense raises an issue about Applicant\u2019s willingness to \ncomply with important criminal laws. When combined with the bad judgment he exercised \nduring the same time period by not reporting his arrest in a timely manner, Applicant \nevidences a pattern of rule violations. As noted below, this evidence supports a whole-\nperson assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, and \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d).2  \n                                                          \n2 The factors are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding \nthe conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \n\n \n11 \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines F and E in my whole-person \nanalysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). In particular, I have weighed \nApplicant\u2019s age and maturity, the serious nature of his financial misconduct, and his failure \nto obey an important rule on self-reporting potential security issues and the criminal law \nprohibiting driving under the influence of alcohol. His misconduct started in 2013 when he \nfailed to file his federal and state income tax returns and has continued up through the \npresent with his failure to pay of his federal taxes. This history of misconduct and pattern \nof rule violations increases the likelihood of the recurrence of poor judgment and \nadditional misconduct.  \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines F and \nE, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant \nhas failed to mitigate the security concerns raised by his past actions. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1. Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.h: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.i \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2. Guideline E:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant continued eligibility for access to classified information. \nClearance is denied. \n \n \n \n \nJohn Bayard Glendon \nAdministrative Judge \n                                                          \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for \nthe conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of \ncontinuation or recurrence.  \n \n",

Nagel, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Christopher D. Thomas, Attorney At Law \n \n \nMarch 29, 2019 \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nLokey Anderson, Darlene D., Administrative Judge: \n \nOn August 5, 2010, and March 29, 2016, Applicant submitted security clearance \napplications (e-QIP). (Government Exhibits 1 and 2.)  On October 13, 2017, the \nDepartment of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DoD CAF) issued Applicant \na Statement of Reasons (SOR), detailing security concerns under Guideline E, Personal \nConduct and Guideline F, Financial Considerations. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and \nthe Adjudicative Guidelines, effective within the DoD after June 8, 2017.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on February 5, 2018, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on October 22, 2018.  \nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued a notice of hearing that same day, \nand the hearing was convened as scheduled on November 27, 2018.  The Government \noffered nine exhibits, referred to as Government Exhibits 1 through 9, which were \nadmitted without objection. The Applicant offered eight exhibits, referred to as \nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits A through H, which were admitted without objection.  Applicant \n\n \n2 \n \ncalled two witnesses and testified on his own behalf. DOHA received the transcript of \nthe hearing (Tr.) on December 7, 2018. \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is 39 years old, is married to his second wife and has four children.    \nHe has a Bachelor\u2019s degree in Information Security and is currently working on his \nMasters.  He is employed by a defense contractor as a Cyber Security Analyst.  He is \nseeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment.    \n \nGuideline E \u2013 Personal Conduct \n \n \nThe Government alleged that Applicant is ineligible for a clearance because he \nengaged in conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations that raise questions about his \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information.  \n \n \nAfter graduating from high school, at the age of 19, Applicant joined the United \nStates Marine Corps.  In 1999, Applicant, who lived with his parents, requested leave \nfrom the military to take care of his mother who had quit working because she was sick \nwith diabetes and high blood pressure.  Applicant\u2019s leave was denied, but Applicant left \nthe military anyway, without authorization, to take care of his mother.  Applicant took \ncare of his sick mother for two to three months before she went back to work.  Applicant \nwas absent from the military without leave for approximately six years, from September \n1999 to February 2006.  Applicant explained that he was unexpectedly given short- \nnotice that he was being sent on temporary duty to Australia.   He stated that there was \nno one else in his family who could take care of his mother, since his father worked, and \nhis brother was in high school.  Applicant stated that his family was experiencing \nfinancial problems and they could not afford to hire someone to take care of his mother.  \nIn 2006, Applicant returned to duty and pled guilty at a trial by court-marital.  He \nreceived a bad conduct discharge from the military in November 2006. \n \n \n \nIn 2010, Applicant began working for a defense contractor and in 2011, he was \ngranted a security clearance that he has held for the past eight years.  In April 2013, \nwhile possessing a security clearance, and while married to a woman in the United \nStates, but separated from her, Applicant became romantically involved with a female \nforeign national from Taiwan he met on line.  Applicant continued the affair with his \nTaiwanese girlfriend until approximately September 2013.  In June 2013, Applicant \ntraveled to Taiwan to visit the Taiwanese woman.  The Government contends that the \nApplicant falsified his travel request with his employer by telling them that he was taking \nhis wife to Taiwan for her birthday.  Applicant denies that he did this.  The Government \nalso contends that Applicant did not receive a travel briefing required before he traveled \nto Taiwan as he was directed.  Applicant denies this.  The Government further contends \nthat Applicant lied about saying the reason he stayed longer than his scheduled date of \nleave in Taiwan was because he missed his flight, when in fact, he intentionally missed \nhis return flight to the United States in order to stay longer with the Taiwanese woman.  \n\n \n3 \n \nAs a result, Applicant was absent without leave from work from June 21, 2013 through \nJune 25, 2013.  Applicant claims that he notified his employer that he would not be \nreturning to work as originally scheduled.  Applicant was questioned by a DoD \ninvestigator about the issue, and said that he would not be seeing the Taiwanese girl \nagain.  Following that situation, Applicant\u2019s Taiwanese girlfriend visited him in the United \nStates, spending about six weeks with him, from approximately July to September 2013.  \nApplicant failed to report this foreign contact to his company security department.  The \nsummaries of the Applicant\u2019s interviews dated September 28, 2010; October 31, 2010; \nJanuary 31, 2017, as well as a Government memorandum for the record dated October \n1, 2014 corroborates the Government\u2019s position.  Accordingly, this allegation under \nGuideline E is found against the Applicant.  (Government Exhibit 3, 8 and 9.) \n \n \nApplicant completed an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing \n(e-OIP) dated March 29, 2016.  (Government Exhibit 2.)  In response to Section 26 \nconcerning his financial record, Applicant was a series of questions.  Specifically, in the \npast seven years has he had a judgment entered against him?  Is he currently \ndelinquent on any Federal debt?  Has he defaulted on any type of loan?  Has he had \nbills or debts turned over to a collection agency?\u201d The Applicant answered, \u201cNO.\u201d  \nThese were false responses.  Applicant failed to list the debts set forth under Guideline \nF, below.  This allegation is also found against the Applicant, see discussion below.       \n \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe Government alleged that Applicant is ineligible for a clearance because he \nmade financial decisions that indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which raise questions about his \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information.  \n \n \nThe SOR identified six delinquent debts, three of which are student loan \naccounts, totaling approximately $100,000, showing a history of financial problems.  \nApplicant denies each of the allegations set forth in the SOR, except allegation 2.a., \nunder this guideline.  Credit reports of the Applicant dated August 21, 2010; April 13, \n2016; April 21, 2017; and April 10, 2018, confirm the outstanding debts.  (Government \nExhibits 4, 5, 6 and 7.)           \n \n \n1.a.  A delinquent Colorado student loan debt was placed for collection in the \napproximate amount of $74,148.  Applicant states that this debt was packaged, sold, \nand consolidated with his other student loans, and he is making regular monthly \npayments to resolve the debt.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit D.)   \n \n \n1.b.  A delinquent U.S Department of Education student loan debt was placed for \ncollection in the approximate amount of $15,595.  Applicant states that this debt was \npackaged, sold, and consolidated with his other student loans, and he is making regular \nmonthly payments to resolve the debt.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit D.) \n          \n \n1.c.  A delinquent U.S. Department of Education student loan debt was placed for \ncollection in the approximate amount of $8,849.   Applicant states that this debt was \n\n \n4 \n \npackaged, sold, and consolidated with his other student loans, and he is making regular \nmonthly payments to resolve the debt.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit D.) \n \n1.d.  A judgment was entered against the Applicant in January 2014, in the \napproximate amount of $5,000.  Applicant states that the debt was paid off through \ngarnishment.  (Tr. pp. 112-113.) \n \n1.e.  A delinquent debt was placed for collection in the approximate amount of \n$204.  Applicant states that the debt was paid off a long time ago.  (Tr. p. 113.)         \n \n1.f.  A delinquent debt was placed for collection in the approximate amount of \n$83.  Applicant contacted the company to pay the debt and there is no record of it.  (Tr. \np. 114.) \n       \n \nApplicant testified that he is now paying his student loans as agreed, and he has \npaid off his other delinquent debts.  After his divorce was finalized, Applicant contacted \nthe U.S. Department of Education, consolidated the loan balances, and set up a \npayment plan to resolve the student loans.  Applicant stated that since 2015, he has \nbeen making regular monthly payments over $300 that are automatically deducted from \nhis bank account, and the debt is now current.  (Tr. p. 111.)  He plans to continue to \nfollow this payment plan until the debt is paid in full.   \n \n \nTwo witnesses testified on behalf of the Applicant.  Applicant\u2019s coworker stated \nthat Applicant is reliable and trustworthy, and should be granted a security clearance.  \nApplicant\u2019s mother testified that she urged Applicant to take care of her during her \nillness, and she feels bad about the fact that this has caused him trouble in the military \nand now with his security clearance.  (Tr. pp. 36-80.)   \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s performance review for the period from July 20, 2012 to July 19, 2013 \nindicates for the most part that he \u201cconsistently meets requirements.\u201d  (Applicant\u2019s \nExhibit E.) \n \n \nA letter of recommendation from Applicant\u2019s long-time friend and coworker \nattests to Applicant\u2019s loyalty, honesty, and integrity.  Applicant is described as being \nvery knowledgeable and experienced in his field, and he is highly recommended for a \nsecurity clearance.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit H.)        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \n\n \n5 \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence that \nestablishes controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \n\u201capplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, \nand has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance \ndecision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct \n \nThe security concern for the personal conduct guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \n\n \n6 \n \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and  \n \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports \na \nwhile-person \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information; \n \n(1) \nUntrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client \nconfidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized release \nof sensitive corporate or government protected information; \n \n(2) \na pattern of dishonesty or rule violations. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I have \nconsidered each of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 below: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a \nperson with professional responsibilities for advising or instructing the \nindividual specifically concerning security processes. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \n\n \n7 \n \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activities was unwitting, \nhas ceased, or occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon \nthe individual's reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations. \n \n \nIt is noted that Applicant\u2019s misconduct in the Marine Corps is almost 20 years \nremoved.  However, Applicant\u2019s poor decision making has continued over the years.  \nHis credibility is also in question.  Applicant was not truthful with the Government \nconcerning his affair and interlude with his Taiwanese girlfriend, while still married to a \nwoman in the United States.  Applicant deliberately lied to his employer on various \noccasions regarding this relationship.  His conduct does not show honesty, integrity, \ngood judgment or reliability.  Furthermore, Applicant deliberately failed to disclose his \ndelinquent debts on his security clearance application.  Applicant claims that he thought \nhis wife at the time was paying his student loans.  However, given the number of \nstudent loans he had, and the sizable amount of the student loans, Applicant knew or \nshould have known that these debts remained owing when he completed his security \nclearance application in August 2016.  If he did not know, he should have checked his \ncredit report before completing the application.  The fact that he did not list these loans \nin response to questions on his application, shows that he was either extremely \ncareless, or he deliberately concealed the information from the Government, which in \neither case indicates questionable judgment, unreliability, and untrustworthiness, \ncharacteristics of an individual who does not meet the qualifications for access to \nclassified information.     \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \n\n \n8 \n \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n  \nApplicant incurred delinquent debts that he could not pay.  The evidence is \nsufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \n  \n \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I have \nconsidered each one of them set forth below:    \n \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g. loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling from a \nlegitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling \nservice, and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved \nor is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; \n \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nApplicant is paying his student loans and they are now current.    He is also \npaying his other delinquent debts.  Applicant has incurred no new delinquent debt.  He \nhas demonstrated that future financial problems are unlikely.  Accordingly, this guideline \nis found for the Applicant.   \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline E and Guideline F in my whole-person analysis.  Applicant is not young and \nna\u00efve.  He is a 39-year-old man who has held a security clearance for the past eight \nyears, and who has not been truthful with the government when required.  Applicant has \nnot demonstrated that he can be trusted with the national secrets.  He lied on his \nsecurity clearance application about not having delinquent debts.  He lied to his \nemployer in an effort to conceal information about his Taiwanese girlfriend that he \nobviously did not want his company to know about.  This is not an individual with whom \nthe Government can be confident to know that he will always follow rules and \nregulations and do the right thing, even when no one is looking.  He is not qualified for \naccess to classified information, nor is it clear that the information will be properly \nprotected.  Applicant does not meet the qualifications for a security clearance.          \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with many questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the Personal Conduct security concerns.    \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n10 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.e:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.f:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

The SOR further \ninformed Applicant that, based on information available to the government, DoD \nadjudicators could not make the preliminary affirmative finding it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on October 20, 2017, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. (Answer.) The case was assigned to me on January 4, \n2018. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing \non January 9, 2018, scheduling the hearing for February 15, 2018. The hearing was \nconvened as scheduled. The Government offered Exhibits (GXs) 1 through 8, which \nwere admitted into evidence. Applicant testified on his own behalf. The record was left \nopen until March 15, 2018, for receipt of additional documentation. Applicant offered \n\n \n2 \n \none document, which I marked Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AppX) A, and was admitted into \nevidence. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (TR) on February 26, 2018. \n \nProcedural Rulings \n \nAt the hearing, the Government requested I take administrative notice of certain \nfacts relating to Afghanistan. Department Counsel provided a seven-page summary of \nthe facts, supported by six Government documents pertaining to Afghanistan, identified \nas GX 7. The documents provide elaboration and context for the summary. I take \nadministrative notice of the facts included in the U.S. Government reports. They are \nlimited to matters of general knowledge, not subject to reasonable dispute. They are set \nout in the Findings of Fact. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted to the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a.~1.c., 1.e.~1.l, 1.o., and 2.a. \nand 2.b. He denied SOR allegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.d., 1.m., and 1.n. After a thorough and careful \nreview of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 66-year-old employee of a defense contractor. (GX 1 at pages 5 \nand 14.) He has been employed with the defense contractor since January of 2014. (GX \n1 at page 14.) Applicant immigrated to the United States from Afghanistan in 1985, and \nbecame a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1995.

Applicant admits that from about 2003 until 2008 he lost about $40,000 due \nto gambling at a local casino. (TR at page 24 line 17 to page 27 line 10.) Although, \nApplicant has not gambled for about 10 years, he admits that his gambling is one of the \nroots of his present financial difficulties. (Id.) The other root is periods of unemployment \nand underemployment. (GX 1 at pages 15~21.) \n \n \n1.b.~1.c., and 1.e.~1.l. Applicant admits that he is indebted to ten separate \ncreditors for past-due debts totaling about $20,531. (TR at page 24 line 4~16, and at \npage 27 lines 11~21.) Despite having been given a month to address these admitted \npast-due debts, Applicant has submitted nothing further in their regard. These \nallegations are found against Applicant. \n \n \n1.d. Applicant disputes that he is indebted to Creditor D for an alleged past-due \nmedical debt in the amount of about $5,014. (TR at page 21 line 25 to page 22 line 23.) \nDespite having been given a month to address this disputed debt, Applicant has \nsubmitted nothing further in this regard. As this debt does appear as past-due on the \nGovernment\u2019s July 2017 credit report, this allegation is found against Applicant. (GX 4 \nat page 2.) \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n1.m.

Despite having been given a month to \naddress this debt, Applicant has submitted nothing further in this regard.

Applicant denies that he is indebted to Creditor N for an alleged past-due \nutility debt in the amount of about $105. (TR at page 23 lines 6~23, and at page 36 line \n9 to page 37 line 15.) Despite having been given a month to address this disputed debt, \nApplicant has submitted nothing further in this regard. As this debt does appear as past-\ndue on the Government\u2019s July 2017 credit report, this allegation is found against \nApplicant. (GX 4 at page 3.) \n \n \n1.o. Applicant admits that he has an outstanding state tax lien against him in the \namount of about $7,613. As Applicant has submitted nothing further in this regard, this \nallegation is found against Applicant. \n \nGuideline B \u2013 Foreign Influence \n \n \n2.a. Applicant admits that his brother, who works in a pharmacy, and his 70-year-\nold sister are citizens and residents of Afghanistan. (TR at page 29 line 22 to page 34 \nline 4.) As Applicant has very little contact with either of these siblings, this allegation is \nfound for Applicant. \n \n \n2.b. Applicant admits that his mother-in-law and his father-in-law are citizens and \nresidents of Afghanistan. (TR at page 43 line 13 to page 44 line 13.) As Applicant has \nvery little contact with either of these in-laws, this allegation is found for Applicant. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNotice \n \n \nI take administrative notice of the following facts regarding Afghanistan: A U.S. \nState Department Travel Warning remains in effect for Afghanistan. Extremists \nassociated with various Taliban networks, the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), and \nmembers of other armed opposition groups are active throughout the country. (GX 7 at \npage 3.)  \n  \n \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative \njudge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \nnational security eligibility. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \n\n \n4 \n \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall \nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \n\n \n5 \n \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Five are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired; and \n \n(h) borrowing money or engaging in significant financial transactions to \nfund gambling or pay gambling debts. \n \n  \nApplicant had significant gambling debt.  He currently has past-due debts totaling \nabout $26,000, and a $7,600 state tax lien. The evidence is sufficient to raise these \ndisqualifying conditions.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 including: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n \n\n \n6 \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; \n \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems are ongoing. He has a long history of \ndelinquencies that have not been resolved. Applicant has not demonstrated that future \nfinancial problems are unlikely. Mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(a) has not been established. \n \n \nApplicant attributed his recent delinquencies, in part, to past periods of \nunemployment. These are circumstances beyond his control. However, he failed to \nestablish that he acted reasonably or responsibly with respect to his debts. Full \nmitigation under AG \u00b6 20(b) has not been established. \n \n \nApplicant is not receiving any financial counseling. Further, there are no clear \nindications that his financial problems are being resolved or are under control. Mitigation \nunder AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) or (d) has not been established. \n \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(f) and 20(g) are inapplicable to this case. Applicant failed to address an \noutstanding state tax lien. Guideline F is found against Applicant. \n \nGuideline B - Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in \nAG \u00b6 6: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \n\n \n7 \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology \n \n  \nApplicant has two siblings and in-laws who are citizens and residents of \nAfghanistan. The evidence is sufficient to raise these disqualifying conditions.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered all \nof the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 including: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \n \n \nApplicant has little contact with his siblings and in-laws. Guideline B is found for \nApplicant. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n\n \n8 \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines F and B in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment.  \n \nApplicant is a respected linguist, serving with American forces in Afghanistan. He \nperforms well at his job. (AppX A.) Overall, however, the record evidence leaves me \nwith questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the Financial \nConsiderations security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a~1.o.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline B:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a. and 2.b.: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \nRichard A. Cefola \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (e-QIP) on January 3, 2017. \nOn August 23, 2017, the Department of Defense (DOD) sent her a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR), alleging security concerns under Guidelines F (Financial Considerations). The \nDOD acted under Executive Order (Ex. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective June 8, 2017.  \nApplicant submitted her Answer to the SOR on September 18, 2017, and \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to \nproceed on November 1, 2017, and the case was assigned to me on March 20, 2018. On \nMay 22, 2018, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant \n03/19/2019\n\n2 \n \nthat the hearing was scheduled for June 6, 2018. I convened the hearing as scheduled. \nGovernment Exhibits (GX) 1 through 3 were admitted into evidence without objection. \nApplicant testified and Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through D were admitted without \nobjection. I left the record open until June 20, 2018, to enable Applicant to submit \nadditional documentary evidence. She timely submitted AX E and F, which I have \nadmitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on June 14, 2018. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 38-year-old supplier-diversity-specialist currently employed by a \ndefense contractor since February 2015. She earned her bachelor\u2019s degree in 2008 and \nher juris doctor in 2013. This is her first application for security clearance. (GX 1.)  \n \nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleges 22 past-due accounts totaling $17,762, 19 of \nwhich are past-due medical accounts totaling $10,517. In her Answer, Applicant admits \neach of the debts and explains their origin and current status. The delinquent debts are \nreflected in Applicant\u2019s credit bureau report (CBR) from April 2017, discussed during her \npersonal subject interview (PSI) from May 2017, and many are listed on her e-QIP from \nJanuary 2017. (GX 3; GX 2; GX 1.)  \n \n \nIn 2012, Applicant was in law school, working a part-time job, and living at home \nwith her mother and two younger siblings. Her mother became gravely ill, and was no \nlonger able to work. Applicant used her meager earnings and took additional student \nloans to pay the family\u2019s living expenses, including the mortgage. Applicant fell behind on \nthe payments on her two credit-card accounts that she had opened during college. \nAdditionally, Applicant was unable to afford health insurance. She began experiencing \nmedical issues and was diagnosed with an illness that required frequent blood screening \nand sometimes required hospitalization. She amassed significant medical debt which she \nwas unable to pay due to the expenses of maintaining the family\u2019s household. (Tr. 16-\n19.) \n \n \nAfter graduating from law school, Applicant worked as a law clerk from September \n2013 until August 2014. She worked on a campaign for a senator from September 2014 \nuntil December 2014. Applicant experientially benefited from these two jobs, but they \nwere not lucrative. She was unemployed from December 2014 until she started her \ncurrent job in February 2015, which required her to move to another state. Applicant took \nout a loan to help with moving expenses, including the requisite down-payment on an \napartment of first and last month\u2019s rent and a security deposit, which was approximately \n$3,600. She had a long commute and spent a significant amount each month on gas and \ntolls. At the end of 2016, Applicant was required by her employer to again relocate. She \ntook another loan to cover moving expenses. She completed repaying the two moving-\nrelated loans in March 2017. (Tr. 38-39.) Her student loans are in good standing. (Tr. 40.) \n \n \nApplicant then started addressing her delinquent debt. Her ongoing plan is to pay \noff the smaller debts first and progress to the largest one. Applicant paid the $160 medical \ndebt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.p. (AX B.) She settled-in-full the $2,286 delinquent credit-card \n\n3 \n \ndebt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a and the $524 medical debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.q. (AX A; AX \nD.) She entered a repayment plan in July 2017 with the medical creditor of SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, \n1.c, and 1.r. She has satisfied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b - $122 and 1.c - $35, and owes approximately \n$1,093 on the $1,308 account alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.r. (Tr. 24-25.) She has 16 monthly \npayments of $55 remaining on her repayment plan with the creditor of SOR \u00b6 1.p, a \ndelinquent credit card originally $1,318 and now $823. (AX C.) \n \n \nThe creditor of the $3,641 credit-card debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.o sought a default \njudgment which was entered against Applicant in 2016. Applicant\u2019s friend, an attorney, \nsuccessfully petitioned to have the judgment vacated because Applicant was never \nserved with notice. The attorney is now negotiating with the creditor on Applicant\u2019s behalf \nand is attempting to reach a settlement agreement. (AX E; Tr. 22-23.) \n \n \nThe $102, $166, and $108 medical debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 1.f, and 1.g are \nin collection with the same creditor. The $200, $40, and $65 debts are in collection with \nanother creditor. Applicant contacted the creditors to verify that the accounts were hers. \nApplicant stated that she intended to enter repayment agreements with these two \ncreditors in July 2018. (Tr. 26-28.) \n \n \nThe remaining accounts, SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.l through 1.n and 1.s through 1.v, totaling \n$7,473 were incurred when Applicant had to be hospitalized for her medical condition and \nwas uninsured. Applicant will contact this creditor as soon as she is financially able to \nenter into a repayment plan, which she anticipated would be the end of 2018. (Tr. 27-29.) \n \nApplicant now earns approximately $73,000 annually in salary. (Tr. 38.) She lives \nwithin her means and has not incurred any delinquent debt since 2014. (GX 3; Tr. 41-42.) \nApplicant\u2019s direct supervisor of over three years, who is aware of the nature of the SOR \nallegations, highly recommends Applicant for a security clearance, stating that she is \ntrustworthy and that her most recent performance evaluation rated her as overall \nexceeding expectations. (AX F.) Applicant was candid, sincere, and credible while \ntestifying. \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant\u2019s meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \n\n4 \n \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 at 3, \n1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993).  \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n5 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended \nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds\u2026. \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n \n \nThe following disqualifying conditions apply: \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; and  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \n \n \nThe relevant mitigating conditions in this case are: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial difficulties arose due to conditions largely beyond her control. \nSpecifically, Applicant\u2019s mother became extremely ill in 2012 and was unable to work. \nApplicant, a law student with a part-time job, became responsible for the household \nexpenses, including the mortgage, for her mother\u2019s house where her mother, her two \n\n6 \n \nyounger siblings, and she resided. Applicant used her earnings and additional student \nloans to cover these expenses. She fell behind on her personal credit-card accounts, and \nwas unable to afford health insurance. Applicant began experiencing medical issues \nwhich required numerous treatments, including periods of hospitalization. She incurred \nsignificant medical debt. Applicant\u2019s first two jobs after graduating from law school were \nlow-paying. In order to begin work at her current employer in February 2015, Applicant \nwas required to move. She took out a loan to cover the moving-related expenses. At the \nend of 2016, while she was still paying off the loan for the moving-related expenses, \nApplicant\u2019s employer required her to move again. Applicant took a second loan to cover \nmoving-related expenses. She completed repaying these two loans in March 2017, and \nimmediately began to address her delinquent debts. Applicant established and instituted \na plan to pay her smaller debts first, then progress to the repayment of her largest debt. \nShe has resolved six SOR debts, is paying one debt, and has contacted the two creditors \nof six of the debts with the intention of establishing repayment plans in July 2018. The \njudgment entered against her has been vacated and an attorney is working on reaching \na settlement agreement on Applicant\u2019s behalf. She stated her intention to contact the \nremaining unaddressed SOR creditor, who is collecting for seven debts, before the end \nof 2018. She has not incurred any delinquent debts since 2014, and lives within her \nmeans. Her student loans are in good standing. \n \n \n \n\u201cGood faith\u201d means acting in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, \nhonesty, and adherence to duty or obligation. ISCR Case No. 99-0201, 1999 WL 1442346 \nat *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999). A security clearance adjudication is an evaluation of a \nperson\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. It is not a debt-collection procedure. \nISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). A person is not required to establish \nresolution of every debt alleged in the SOR. He or she need only establish a plan to \nresolve financial problems and take significant actions to implement the plan. The \nadjudicative guidelines do not require that a person make payments on all delinquent \ndebts simultaneously, nor do they require that the debts alleged in the SOR be paid first. \nSee ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial difficulties are not due to reckless spending or irresponsible \nbehavior and did not arise under circumstances that cast doubt on her current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. By addressing her debts in a responsible manner, \nApplicant has taken proactive steps to ensure ongoing financial stability. Although her \nfinancial record is not perfect, she has implemented a reasonable plan to resolve her \nfinancial issues within her means, and to avoid future financial difficulties. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), \n20(b), and 20(d) apply. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2, the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-person concept, \nan administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by \nconsidering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light \n\n7 \n \nof the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole-person analysis.  \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nmitigated the security concerns raised by her delinquent debts. Accordingly, I conclude \nshe has carried her burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest \nto grant her eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nAs required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, I make the following \nformal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): FOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.v:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \nStephanie C. Hess \nAdministrative Judge \n \n \n \n \n \n",

Edmunds, Esq.  \n12/09/2019 \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nKATAUSKAS, Philip J., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny her eligibility for \naccess to classified information. She did not present sufficient evidence to explain, \nextenuate, and mitigate the security concern stemming from her problematic income tax \nand financial history. Accordingly, this case is decided against Applicant.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn January 12, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (CAF) sent Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging that \nher circumstances raised security concerns under Guideline F, financial considerations. \nThis action was taken under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended, as well as DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive). The Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for \nAccess to Classified Information (AG), effective within the Defense Department on June \n8, 2017, apply here. Applicant answered the SOR on February 7, 2018, and requested a \nhearing to establish her eligibility for continued access to classified information. \n\n2 \n \n \n \n \nI was assigned the case on July 20, 2018. On September 27, 2018, a date mutually \nagreed to by the parties, a hearing was held. Applicant testified at the hearing. The \nGovernment offered seven exhibits, which were marked for identification as GE 1 through \n7, and which were admitted without objection. Applicant offered 25 exhibits (AE), which \nwere marked for identification as AE A through Y, and were admitted without objection. \nThe record was left open until October 12, 2018. Applicant timely submitted 17 additional \nexhibits, which were marked for identification as AE Z through AE PP and admitted \nwithout objection. The transcript of the hearing (Tr.) was received on October 12, 2018. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is 64 years old, married with three adult children, the youngest of whom \nwas in college at the time of the hearing. The two oldest children are college graduates. \nApplicant is a college graduate with a major in Accounting. In the near future, she plans \nto take courses in preparation for the certified public accountants exam. From 1993 until \n2016, Applicant was the owner and independent contractor of her own company. She did \nconsulting, financial analysis, and project management for federal agencies. Her husband \nwas one of her employees. Since March 2016, Applicant has been employed as an \naccountant and auditor for a defense contractor. Since Sept 2016, her spouse has been \nemployed as a contract representative for a national accounting firm. (GE 1; Tr. 16-19, \n55-56.) Although there were instances of personal financial and professional hardship, \ndiscussed below, since 2016 Applicant and her spouse have had full-time employment \nand make $108,000 and $175,000 per year, respectively. (Tr. 18-19, 54-55.) \n \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant failed to file as required her federal income tax \nreturns for 1989, 1991 and 1992, 1995 and 1996, 2005 and 2006, 2009 through 2012, \nand 2014 and 2015. The SOR also alleged that Applicant failed to file as required state \nincome tax returns for 1989, 1991 through 1996, 2003, 2005 and 2006, and 2008 through \n2012. The SOR alleges that Applicant is indebted to the federal government for delinquent \ntaxes for 2011 ($69,849) and 2012 ($5,225). (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-d.) Applicant denied those \nallegations and pleaded matters in mitigation, but she admitted that her federal and state \nincome tax returns were not timely filed. Applicant also contended that the 13 untimely \nfederal filings all had an \u201callowable six-month \u2018extension\u2019\u201d and that seven of those 13 \nestimated a refund. She was advised by her tax preparer that timely filing was not required \nif she was getting a refund. All of the late state and federal income tax returns were filed \nbetween 1991 and 2012 (state) and 1991 and 2017 (federal). (Answer \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-d; Tr. 21, \n57.)  \n \nApplicant attributed her failure to file federal and state income tax returns and pay \ntaxes due to a number of reasons: (1) in 1989 her father-in-law was diagnosed with cancer \nand died in 1995; (2) Applicant and her spouse experienced job lay-offs due to downsizing \nof companies they worked for; (3) in 2009 Applicant\u2019s youngest sister was diagnosed with \ncancer and her husband had been laid off, so Applicant and her spouse financially \nsupported her sister, who had no medical insurance; her sister died in December 2013. \n(Answer \u00b6\u00b6 1.a & b; AE U.)  \n\n3 \n \n \nThe SOR also alleged 14 delinquent consumer debts totaling $105,093. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.e-r.) Applicant denied the allegations, answering that she is either \u201ccontinuing to make \nall monthly payments per [her] legal agreement with [the creditor]\u201d (Answer \u00b6\u00b6 1.e-g, and \nn), or that she has \u201cworked with [the creditor] to establish a repayment agreement\u201d \n(Answer \u00b6\u00b6 1.h-m, and o-r). \n \n Applicant\u2019s first financial problems (in contrast to her tax filing problems) \ndeveloped in 2009, when her sister was diagnosed with terminal cancer. At that time, her \nsister\u2019s spouse had been laid off. He had no income, nor did his wife, who had no medical \ninsurance. As a result, Applicant and her spouse assumed all of the financial burdens of \nApplicant\u2019s sister and her husband until her sister died. Applicant purchased a car for her \nsister, so she could get to her treatments. Applicant\u2019s sister and husband were living in a \nhotel, which Applicant paid for by making cash transfers to her sister. (Tr. 49-50; GE 1; \nAE U.) \n \nSeveral months before Applicant\u2019s sister died, Applicant received notification in \nApril 2013 from one of her prime contractors, to which her company was a subcontractor, \nthat the federal agency was making significant contractual cuts due to sequestration. That \nrequired Applicant to cut two of her five employees who were working on that subcontract. \nOne of those employees was her spouse; she had no discretion as to whom to cut as the \nprime contractor specifically named her spouse as one of the two to be cut. Applicant\u2019s \nspouse had worked for her company from 2009 to 2013. Applicant did not testify as to the \nfinancial impact these cuts had, but it is fair to infer that the effect was adverse to \nApplicant\u2019s company and to the family finances. (Tr.51-54; AE T.)  \n \nApplicant also testified about college expenses for her three children in that \ntimeframe. Her oldest and middle daughters were in private colleges. Together, their \ntuition, books, and living expenses were about $50,000 to $60,000 per year. They \ngraduated in 2013 and 2015. Applicant currently has one child, her son, who is in college, \nand she pays his expenses. (Tr. 54.) \n \nApplicant testified that the federal government sequestration and an early contract \ntermination caused reduced income from mid-2013 through the early contract termination \nin March 2016. From mid-2013 through 2015, Applicant was paying all her credit card \ndebt every month. Applicant explained that she ran up significant credit card debt primarily \nto support her business. It was \u201cvery difficult to get capital, in particular when [her] \nsubcontractor\u2019s being cut back.\u201d Applicant testified about an April 24, 2016 notice (AE S) \nterminating her company\u2019s subcontract that was supporting a federal agency prime \ncontract. The termination was unexpected and cancelled all funding for that project. That \ntermination had a dramatically adverse effect on Applicant\u2019s business. Before the \ntermination, Applicant\u2019s gross revenues had been at least $50,000 per month. It was her \nsole source of income. After the termination, her income and her husband\u2019s income went \nto zero. From May 2016 until September 2016, her spouse was unemployed. (Tr. 18-19, \n38-39, 49, 54-55, 60-61.) Applicant found full-time employment in March 2016. \n \n\n4 \n \nApplicant offered exhibits and testimony about how she has addressed and is \naddressing her income tax problems. Applicant submitted IRS tax transcripts showing \nmonthly payments under installment plans for tax years 2009 through 2012 in amounts \nvarying from $3,000 in June 2013 until the last payment for tax year 2012 in September \n2018 for $2,000 (AE X). She also provided documents showing monthly payments under \ninstallment agreements for tax years 2009 through 2010 varying from $1,000 to $3,000 \nper month (Tr. 23-29, AE Z; AE AA through AE CC). She made no monthly payments to \nthe IRS from February through May 2016. When her payments were not in the amount \nset forth in the latest installment agreement, the IRS accepted the payments and credited \nthem to another tax year. (AE X; GE 5, p. 25.) Notwithstanding Applicant\u2019s payments \nunder IRS payment plans, she still needs to defray about $70,000 in tax arrearages for \n2011, which is the approximate amount alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c. (Tr. 73-74.) \n \nApplicant currently has applied with the IRS for a new payment plan, and she was \nnot certain if her recent payments were under an existing plan.  (Tr. 62-64.) The latest \nIRS agreement signed by Applicant and her spouse is dated May 29, 2018, and applies \nto tax years 2011 and 2012 with a balance due of $70,096 with $2,000 in monthly \npayments. (AE BB.)  That same exhibit also includes the first page of an IRS letter dated \nJuly, 25, 2018, acknowledging receipt of an installment agreement for tax year 2017. It \ninstructs Applicant to continue to make payments under any existing agreement while the \nIRS processes the latest request. (AE BB.) To recap, Applicant has been under IRS \npayment plans regularly, if not necessarily continuously, since May 31, 2013 to present. \n(AE X; AE Z; AE AA; AE BB.) She currently continues to make monthly payments to the \nIRS of $2,000. (Tr. 71-73.) \n \nApplicant has not filed her federal income tax return for 2016, which is \u201cbeing \nworked on by someone else\u201d because she does not have the time. Applicant has not filed \nher federal return for 2017; she claims that it is not due until October 2018 because of an \nextension. No document was submitted at the hearing or post-hearing showing such an \nextension. Applicant does not know if she owes any federal taxes for 2016 or 2017. She \nhas not filed her state income tax returns for 2016 or 2017. (Tr. 74-75.)  \n \nApplicant testified about SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1. e and f, two signature loans with a credit union \n($826 past due, $24,761 bal.). Applicant\u2019s documents show monthly payments ($620) to \nthis creditor since October 2017. (Tr. 36-38; AE A; AE Y, pp. 6-10.) These accounts are \nbeing resolved.  \n \n SOR \u00b6 1.g is a credit card account ($233 past due, bal. $1,247). (Tr. 38-39.) \nApplicant\u2019s documents showed a statement payment due date of February 24, 2018 for \n$29.00; it did not report that that amount, or any amount, was paid by that date. (AE B.) \nAnother document showed $29.00 paid on August 24, 2018. (AE Y, pp. 3-4.)  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.h is a credit card account charged off by the creditor ($18,452).  Applicant \npromised to submit payment documents post-hearing. (Tr. 39-40.) Applicant\u2019s documents \nshowed one payment of $100 on September 28, 2018 (AE GG.)   \n \n\n5 \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i and j are two credit cards charged off by the creditor ($16,267). (Tr. 41-\n42.) Applicant\u2019s documents showed a first payment of $100 on September 17, 2018, with \nfive additional monthly payments scheduled, the second one to be paid on September \n19, 2018. (AE C; AE HH; AE II.) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.k is a credit card charged off by the creditor ($13,946). (Tr. 42.) \nApplicant\u2019s documents showed a one-time payment on September 17, 2018, but no \namount was stated. (AE D.) Applicant\u2019s post-hearing submissions did not provide any \nadditional documents about this debt. (AE Z through AE PP.) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.l is an account placed for collection by the creditor ($1,419). (Tr. 43-44.) \nApplicant promised to submit payment documents post-hearing. Applicant\u2019s post-hearing \nsubmission showed one payment to the collection agent of $100 on September 18, 2018. \n(AE FF; AE JJ.)  \nSOR \u00b6 1.m is an account charged off by the creditor ($8,822). Applicant\u2019s AE E \nrefers to two different accounts with this creditor but does not refer to the account that is \nthe subject of this SOR allegation. The correct exhibit shows monthly of payments of $620 \nbeing paid from October 17, 2017 to September 6, 2018. (AE Y, p. 8 (no payment was \nmade in August 2018).) (Tr. 44-45.) This account is being resolved.  \nSOR \u00b6 1.n is a credit card account ($1,619 past due, bal. $40,290). Applicant was \nreferred to AE F, which showed a minimum payment due date of February 16, 2018 but \ndid not show any payment made. A more recent statement showed no past due payment \nand previous payments made of $707 with no available credit. (AE Y, p. 11; Tr. 45-46.)  \n SOR \u00b6 1.o, an account that has been charged off by the creditor ($17,913). (Tr. \n46.) Applicant\u2019s documentation for this account shows a schedule of automatic monthly \nbank debits prepared by collection counsel from July 21, 2017, to June 21, 2018 ($620). \n(AE E; AE G.) This appears to be a duplicate of SOR \u00b6 1.m. If it not a duplicate, this \naccount is being resolved.  \nSOR \u00b6 1.p is an account that has been charged off by the creditor ($5,949). She \nsaid she was on a monthly payment plan and would submit documentation post-hearing. \n(Tr. 46-47.) Applicant submitted documents showing one payment of $100 on October 3, \n2018. (AE LL.)   \nSOR \u00b6 1.q is an account that has been charged off by the creditor ($8,895). She \nsaid that she is on a payment plan and would provide documentation post-hearing. (Tr. \n47.) Applicant\u2019s post-hearing submission showed one payment of $100 on September 28, \n2018, to collection counsel. (AE MM.)  \nSOR \u00b6 1.r is an account that has been charged off by the creditor ($10,752). She \ntestified that she is on a payment agreement and referred to AE H. (Tr. 47.) That exhibit \nshows four monthly payments of $100 from September 17, 2018, through December 30, \n2018.  \n\n6 \n \nApplicant submitted three letters of recommendation. The first author praised her \n\u201cquality of work and attention to detail\u201d and had a high regard for her \u201cprofessional integrity \nand strength of character.\u201d A second author lauded Applicant as \u201chighly professional and \nhonest\u201d and that her \u201cdedication and loyalty to the mission [was] unwavering.\u201d The third \nauthor noted her \u201cgreat integrity, both personally and professionally\u201d and that she was \nhighly \u201ctrustworthy.\u201d The authors had known Applicant for 10 years or more. Applicant \ntestified that the authors were aware of the SOR allegations. (AE O; Tr. 47-48.) Applicant \nprovided documents that she enrolled in and completed an online financial education \nprogram on September 26, 2018. (AE DD.) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held in \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).  \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \n \n\n7 \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe financial considerations security concern is set out in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \nThe guideline sets forth several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following conditions are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  \n \n(f) failure to file . . . annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns or \nfailure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required.  \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) through (c) apply to Applicant\u2019s delinquent consumer debts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n19(a) through (c) and (f) apply to the tax issues in question. Applicant had a duty to file \nher annual state and Federal income tax returns in a timely manner and pay any taxes \ndue. Filing tax returns as required is not a mere formality. As the Appeal Board has long \nheld:  \n \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem \ncomplying with well-established governmental rules and systems. Voluntary \n\n8 \n \ncompliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002). As we \nhave noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is not directed at collecting \ndebts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No, 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By \nthe same token, neither is it directed towards inducing an applicant to file \ntax returns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s \njudgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her \nlegal obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment \nand reliability required of those granted access to classified information. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015); ISCR \nCase No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016). \n \n \nConditions that could mitigate financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements.  \n \nPertaining to the tax issues, as noted, Applicant had a duty to file her annual state \nand Federal income tax returns in a timely manner and to pay any taxes due. For 13 years \ngoing back as far as 1989, Applicant failed to file her Federal income tax returns. The \nmost recent tardy tax return in the SOR is for tax year 2015, which Applicant filed in \nAugust 2017. Similarly, Applicant filed 15 untimely state income tax returns from 1989 to \n2012, the latter of which she filed in March 2014. She also incurred significant federal \nincome tax arrearages. AG \u00b6 19(f) applies. The question is whether any mitigating \nconditions apply.   \n \n\n9 \n \nApplicant claimed that she was told by a tax preparer that for the years she was \nowed a refund, an untimely filing was not a problem. I find that difficult to believe. From \n1983 to 2016, Applicant\u2019s company offered financial services to clients. It is fair to infer \nthat among those services included income tax advice. Also, since March 2016, Applicant \nhas worked as an accountant and an auditor. She either knew or should have known that \nthe tax preparer\u2019s advice was questionable. Applicant also claims that she was protected \nby the \u201callowable six-month \u2018extensions.\u2019\u201d That might work in Applicant\u2019s favor, except for \ntwo reasons. First, Applicant did not provide a single document showing that she had \nsought such extensions. Second, and more importantly, the tax returns that were \neventually filed were filed well beyond the customary six-month extensions.  \n \nApplicant also claimed that certain family hardships caused her tax problems. First, \nshe noted that her father-in-law was diagnosed with cancer in 1989 and died in 1995. She \noffered no nexus between those events and her failure to file tax returns, which failures \ncontinued until 2017 (federal) and 2012 (state). In short, her failures to file returns \ncontinued long after her father-in-law died. A similar analysis applies to Applicant\u2019s \nexcuse that her youngest sister was diagnosed with cancer in 2009 and died in 2013. \nApplicant\u2019s failures to file tax returns began in 1989 and continued until 2017 (federal) \nand 2012 (state). That is, the failures to file began long before the sister was diagnosed \nand persisted for years (federal) after the sister died in 2013. Applicant\u2019s failures to file \ntimely federal and state income tax returns was just business as usual for over a decade. \nIn fact, she has not yet filed her federal return for 2016 or her return for 2017, for which \nshe claims she has an extension (albeit undocumented) until October 2018. The SOR did \nnot allege failures to file Applicant\u2019s federal returns for 2017 and 2018. I am allowed, \nhowever, to consider non-alleged conduct to assess an applicant\u2019s credibility, to evaluate \nher case for mitigation, or to perform a whole-person analysis. ISCR Case No. 14-01941 \nat 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 30, 2015).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s failures to file did not occur long ago or infrequently. They continue to \nthis day. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. Applicant failed to establish how her family hardships \n(admittedly largely beyond her control) kept her from filing timely income tax returns.  She \ndid not act responsibly in light of those hardships. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. Applicant \ndid go through a financial counseling course but only on the day before the hearing. AG \n\u00b6 20(c) does not apply. Applicant did not establish that her untimely filings were pursuant \nto an agreement with the IRS or the state taxing authority. AG \u00b6 20(g) does not apply.  I \nfind against Applicant on SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b.  \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d allege delinquent federal income taxes for years 2011 and \n2012 in amounts of $69,849 and $5,225, respectively. The documentary evidence \nestablished that Applicant has been under IRS payment plans regularly for those two tax \nyears and for other years not alleged since May 31, 2013. She has rarely missed \npayments and currently makes monthly payments to the IRS of $2,000, while she awaits \nthe IRS approval of her latest payment plan request. She is doing so per IRS instructions. \nApplicant\u2019s efforts to defray her Federal income tax debt long preceded the issuance of \nthe SOR in 2018, which shows her good faith. AG \u00b6 20(g) applies, and I find in favor of \nApplicant on SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d.  \n\n10 \n \n \nAs noted above, AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) through (c) apply to Applicant\u2019s delinquent consumer \ndebts. The next inquiry is whether any mitigating conditions apply.  \n \n \nIn weighing Applicant\u2019s good-faith efforts I must consider the timing of her actions. \nThe Appeal Board has consistently held that timing of an applicant\u2019s resolution of her \nfinancial filing is relevant in evaluating mitigation. An applicant who resolves financial  \nproblems only when her clearance might be imperiled raises questions about her \nwillingness to follow the sometimes complex rules governing classified information when \nher personal interests are not at stake. ISCR Case No. 15-06440 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 26, \n2017). In addition, an applicant must show \u201ca meaningful track record\u201d of repaying her \ndebts. ISCR Case. No. 18-01762 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 26, 2019); ISCR Case No. 07-13041 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 19, 2008); ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008).   \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.f are two loans from a credit union. The evidence shows that \nApplicant has been making monthly payments on these accounts ($620) since October \n2017, well before the SOR was issued. Those two accounts are being resolved and are \nmitigated under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(d), and I find in favor of Applicant on those two accounts.  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.m and 1.o. may be duplicates. In any event, they are being resolved with \nmonthly payment plans that began in July or October 2017, well before the SOR was \nissued. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(d) applies, and I find in favor of Applicant on those two accounts.  \n \n \nApplicant did suffer two periods of unexpected business downturn and a sister who \nwas impecunious and fatally ill. Those are circumstances largely beyond Applicant\u2019s \ncontrol. The next question is whether Applicant acted responsibly under those adverse \nconditions. The payment plans in the below-listed accounts, however, began after the \nSOR was issued or after the SOR was issued and after the hearing: SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g, 1.h, 1.i, \n1.j, 1.k, 1.l, 1.n, 1.p, 1.q, and 1.r. Therefore, Applicant\u2019s remedial efforts are of \nquestionable good faith, and she has not established a meaningful track record in \naddressing those accounts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) does not fully apply. I find against Applicant on \nthose accounts listed in this paragraph.  \n \n \nThe record raises doubts about Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, good \njudgment, and ability to protect classified information. In reaching this conclusion, I \nweighed the evidence as a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed \nthe unfavorable evidence or vice versa. I also gave due consideration to the whole-person \nconcept. (AG \u00b6 2(a)(1)-(9).) \n \n    Accordingly, I conclude that Applicant did not meet her ultimate burden of \npersuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant her \neligibility for access to classified information. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n11 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nA Formal finding for or against Applicant on the sole allegation set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, is: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.c-f: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.g-l: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.m:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.n:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.o:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.p-r: \n \nAgainst Applicant  \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant continued eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 50-year-old employee who is seeking to retain a security clearance previously granted to her. She is employed as a software engineer for a company in the defense industry. She has been so employed since 2005. Her job includes managing 15 employees who are building software products for customers. Her formal education includes a bachelor\u2019s degree in computer science. She has two adult children, a 24- year-old son attending law school and a 23-year-old daughter attending pharmacy school. A native of India, Applicant immigrated to the United States in 1990, and she became a U.S. citizen in 2001. Likewise, her husband is a native of India and a naturalized U.S. citizen. Applicant and her husband met and married in the United States. The SOR concerns 11 delinquent debts for a total amount of about $37,270 and a Chapter 7 bankruptcy case discharged in 2001. Overall, she attributed the financial problems to a business failure with her husband\u2019s restaurant, which he operated in partnership with another person during 2013-2015, and her husband\u2019s long-standing alcoholism and multiple drunk-driving offenses, which were both hidden and unknown to her until 2014. Applicant\u2019s marriage was consistent with her Indian culture with her husband in charge and responsible for the finances.

She provided sufficient evidence to explain and \nmitigate her history of financial problems. Accordingly, this case is decided for \nApplicant.    \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant completed and submitted a Standard Form (SF) 86, Questionnaire for \nNational Security Positions, the official form used for personnel security investigations, \non June 25, 2016.1 This document is commonly known as a security clearance \napplication. Thereafter, on August 24, 2017, after reviewing the application and the \ninformation gathered during a background investigation, the Department of Defense \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility, Fort Meade, Maryland, sent Applicant a statement \nof reasons (SOR), explaining it was unable to find that it was clearly consistent with the \n                                                          \n1 Exhibit 1. \n \n\n \n2 \n \nnational interest to grant her eligibility for access to classified information. The SOR is \nsimilar to a complaint. It detailed the factual reasons for the action under the security \nguideline known as Guideline F for financial considerations.   \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on September 19, 2017. Her answers were mixed \nand included brief explanations for each debt. She also requested an in-person hearing \nbefore an administrative judge.  \n \nThe case was assigned to me on October 31, 2017. The hearing scheduled for \nJanuary 24, 2018, was postponed due to a government shutdown. The hearing took \nplace as rescheduled on April 18, 2018. Applicant appeared with counsel. Department \nCounsel offered documentary exhibits, which were admitted as Exhibits 1-8. Applicant \noffered documentary exhibits, which were admitted as Exhibits A-S. No witnesses were \ncalled other than Applicant.  \n  \nThe record was kept open until May 18, 2018, to allow Applicant an opportunity \nto submit additional matters. She made a timely submission, and those matters are \nadmitted without objections as Exhibits T-Y.   \n \n  Findings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 50-year-old employee who is seeking to retain a security clearance \npreviously granted to her. She is employed as a software engineer for a company in the \ndefense industry. She has been so employed since 2005. Her job includes managing 15 \nemployees who are building software products for customers. Her formal education \nincludes a bachelor\u2019s degree in computer science. She has two adult children, a 24-\nyear-old son attending law school and a 23-year-old daughter attending pharmacy \nschool. A native of India, Applicant immigrated to the United States in 1990, and she \nbecame a U.S. citizen in 2001. Likewise, her husband is a native of India and a \nnaturalized U.S. citizen. Applicant and her husband met and married in the United \nStates.   \n \nThe SOR concerns 11 delinquent debts for a total amount of about $37,270 and \na Chapter 7 bankruptcy case discharged in 2001. Overall, she attributed the financial \nproblems to a business failure with her husband\u2019s restaurant, which he operated in \npartnership with another person during 2013-2015, and her husband\u2019s long-standing \nalcoholism and multiple drunk-driving offenses, which were both hidden and unknown to \nher until 2014. Applicant\u2019s marriage was consistent with her Indian culture with her \nhusband in charge and responsible for the finances. As a result, Applicant was unaware \nof the financial problems, aside from the bankruptcy, until 2014 when she discovered \nher husband\u2019s problem with alcohol. The matters in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.l are \ndiscussed seriatim below. \n \nCharged-off unsecured consumer loan for $20,460.2 Applicant settled this \naccount for $9,700 in September 2017, which was about 50% of the balance of the \ncurrent principal.  \n                                                          \n2 Exhibit F.  \n\n \n3 \n \nCharged-off credit card account for $4,307.3 Applicant settled this account by \nmaking six payments for a total of $2,153 during 2017-2018.  \n \nCharged-off credit card account for $3,367.4 Applicant settled this account for \n$1,300 in March 2018.  \n \nCollection account for $2,460.5 This debt stemmed from an apartment lease for \nher adult children while attending college. The account was resolved with a zero \nbalance as of February 2018. \n \nCollection account for a telecommunications bill for $2,189.6 Applicant admits \nshe owes something for this account, but she is disputing the balance due with the \nassistance of a credit and debt consulting firm. \n \nCollection account for a telecommunications bill for $1,453.7 This account stems \nfrom her husband\u2019s business failure. She is working with the credit and debt consulting \nfirm to resolve the account. \n \nCollection account for a merchant credit card account for $803.8 This account \nhad been in dispute, and with the assistance of the credit and debt consulting firm, \nApplicant settled the account for the lesser amount of $440 in May 2018. \n \nCharged-off account for a consumer account for $287.9 This account had been in \ndispute, and with the assistance of the credit and debt consulting firm, Applicant settled \nthe account for the lesser amount of $127 in May 2018.   \n \nMedical collection account for $265.10 Applicant believes this account should \nhave been paid by her health insurance, she is attempting to validate the account, and \nshe will pay it if the account is verified.  \n \nCharged-off merchant credit card account for $819. This account is a duplicate of \nthe account in SOR \u00b6 1.g. \n \n                                                          \n3 Exhibit G.  \n \n4 Exhibit H.  \n \n5 Exhibit I.  \n \n6 Exhibits J and V. \n \n7 Exhibits K and W. \n \n8 Exhibits L, M, and Y.  \n \n9 Exhibits N and U.  \n \n10 Tr. 49-51.  \n \n\n \n4 \n \nCollection account for telecommunications account for $860.11 This account has \nbeen in dispute, and Applicant is working with the credit and debt consulting firm to \nresolve it. \n \nChapter 7 bankruptcy case filed in 2000 and discharged in 2001. This case \nstarted as a Chapter 13 case, also called a wage earner\u2019s plan, filed in 1998 to allow \nApplicant and her husband to repay debt per a court-approved payment plan. It was \nnecessitated when her husband lost his job. Applicant made the monthly payments until \nshe lost her job. As a result, the bankruptcy case was converted to a Chapter 7 case, \nwhich ended in discharge.  \n \nIn addressing the indebtedness, Applicant\u2019s plan or strategy has been to take \none account at a time usually focusing on the account with the highest balance.12 To \nthat end, she has taken on freelance work as a cook for large events (e.g., weddings) \nand banquets to earn additional money used to pay off debt. Her annual salary with her \nemployer is about $140,000, and her husband earns about $40,000 annually as a part-\ntime software engineer. He has had difficulty keeping a job due to his long-standing \nalcoholism. She participates in her employer\u2019s 401(k) plan. Her first and second monthly \nmortgage payments of about $3,700 are current. She does not have a car loan. In \naddition to working with the credit and debt consulting firm, she had credit counseling in \nApril 2018, and she retained the services of a financial counseling firm in early 2018 \nwith the goals of reducing debt and improving her credit score.13 \n \nApplicant assumed control and responsibility for the household finances in about \n2014-2015.14 She described the process of learning about her husband\u2019s long-standing \nalcoholism and multiple drunk-driving offenses as shocking.15 She only learned about \nhis husband\u2019s problems in 2014, when a counselor at a treatment center called her and \ninvited her to a meeting with her husband.16 Records indicate that Applicant\u2019s husband \nhas had residential treatment multiple times for varying lengths beginning in December \n2007 with the most recent stay in 2017.17 She reports that her husband is now sober \nand is working part-time as a software engineer.18  \n \n                                                          \n11 Exhibits O and X.  \n \n12 Tr. 37-40.  \n \n13 Exhibits C, E, and Q.  \n \n14 Tr. 56-57.  \n \n15 Tr. 59-61.  \n \n16 Tr. 71-72.  \n \n17 Exhibit D.  \n \n18 Tr. 30-31.  \n \n\n \n5 \n \nIn light of her marital difficulties, Applicant and her husband entered into a written \nagreement in October 2017 to maintain financial stability and guide their marriage.19 \nAmong other things, they agreed that her husband will remain sober and will provide \nfinancial support to the family. They also agreed that if her husband fails to maintain his \nsobriety, a formal separation or divorce will follow. Applicant was unequivocal in stating \nthat she is firmly committed to initiating a separation or divorce if her husband does not \nadhere to the agreement.20   \n \nLaw and Policies \n \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017.21 \n \nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.22 As \nnoted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent \nstandard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the \nside of denials.\u201d23 Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt \nabout whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be \nresolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that \nthe burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.24 The Appeal Board has \nfollowed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed under the \nsubstantial-evidence standard.25 \n \n \nA favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted \na security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.26 An \nunfavorable clearance decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing \nsecurity clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.27 \n                                                          \n19 Exhibit S.  \n \n20 Tr. 73-74.  \n \n21 The 2017 AG are available at http://ogc.osd.mil/doha.  \n \n22 Department of the Navy v.

Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).  \n \n26 Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n \n27 Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n\n \n6 \n \n \nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for \naccess to classified information.28 The Government has the burden of presenting \nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.29 An \napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate \nfacts that have been admitted or proven.30 In addition, an applicant has the ultimate \nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.31 \n \nDiscussion \n \n \nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations, the suitability of an applicant may \nbe questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive \nindebtedness or financial problems or difficulties. The overall concern is: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . .32 \n \n \nThe concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified or sensitive information to obtain money or something else of \nvalue. It encompasses concerns about a person\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nimportant qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified or sensitive \ninformation. \n \n \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions as most pertinent:  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n                                                          \n28 ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004). \n \n29 Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14. \n \n30 Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15. \n \n31 Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.  \n \n32 AG \u00b6 18. \n \n\n \n7 \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute of provides \nevidence of actions taken to resolve the issue.  \n \n \nThe evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial \nproblems that is sufficient to raise a security concern under Guideline F. The two \ndisqualifying conditions noted above apply to this case.  \n \n \nConcerning the evidence in extenuation and mitigation, Applicant receives credit \nunder the mitigating conditions mentioned above. The mitigating condition at AG \u00b6 20(a) \nis established because Applicant\u2019s financial problems are largely due to her husband\u2019s \nmishandling of the household finances due to his long-standing alcoholism. Because he \nis now sober and in the marriage under the terms of the written agreement noted above, \nI conclude that Applicant\u2019s financial problems occurred under such circumstances that \nthey are unlikely to recur and do not cast doubt on her current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \n \n \nThe mitigating condition at AG \u00b6 20(b) is established because the conditions that \nresulted in the financial problems were largely beyond Applicant\u2019s control. Her \nhusband\u2019s business failure and his mishandling of the household finances were largely \nbeyond her control given the nature of their marriage and her ignorance of his long-\nstanding alcoholism and multiple drunk-driving offenses. Since learning about her \nhusband\u2019s problems, Applicant has assumed responsibility for handling the household \nfinances and is re-establishing their household finances.  \n \n \nThe mitigating condition at AG \u00b6 20(c) is established based on Exhibits C, E, and \nQ. Applicant\u2019s efforts in this regard are ongoing. \n \n \nThe mitigating condition at AG \u00b6 20(d) is established due to Applicant\u2019s \nsubstantial work in addressing the past-due debts. As established in the findings of fact, \nshe settled 6 of the 11 delinquent accounts. In doing so, she paid approximately \n$16,180 to six creditors.  \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \nThe mitigating condition at AG \u00b6 20(e) is established because Applicant is \ndisputing 4 of the 11 delinquent accounts. Moreover, she provided supporting \ndocumentation regarding three of accounts in dispute, lacking documentation for the \nminor medical collection account for $265.  \n \n \nOverall, I was impressed by Applicant, by her perseverance under difficult \ncircumstances, and by her strength of character she displayed by staying in a marriage \nwhen many people would have called it quits. No fool, she insisted her husband enter \ninto an agreement to guide the future of their marriage. The written agreement is \nessentially a last-chance agreement, which means Applicant is taking the matter quite \nseriously. Although Applicant has not presented a perfect case in mitigation, her case is \na reminder that resolving difficult financial problems is a process, a process that takes \ntime. To date, Applicant has done a good job in resolving the financial problems, and I \nam persuaded she will continue working the process. Likewise, I am persuaded that \nsimilar problems are unlikely to recur.  \n \n \nFollowing Egan and the clearly consistent standard, I have no doubts or \nconcerns about Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the \nevidence as a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the \nunfavorable evidence or vice versa. I also considered the whole-person concept. I \nconclude that he has met his ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFor Applicant  \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a -- 1.l:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information.  \n \n \n \nMichael H.

Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on April 4, 2016. On \nNovember 2, 2017, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD \nCAF) sent her a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline \nF and Guideline E. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) \nimplemented by the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on April 21, 2018, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on August 9, 2018. On September \n13, 2018, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the \n02/19/2019\n\n2 \n \nhearing was scheduled for October 16, 2018. The hearing was rescheduled for good \ncause and I convened the hearing on December 13, 2018. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 \nthrough 7 were admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified, presented two \nwitnesses, and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through F, which were admitted \nwithout objection. At Applicant\u2019s request, I kept the record open until December 28, 2018, \nfor additional submissions. Applicant submitted (AX) G (a packet of documents) in a \ntimely manner. The exhibits was entered into the record without objection. DOHA \nreceived the transcript (Tr.) on January 2, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact1 \n \n \nApplicant is a 59-year-old security officer for a federal contractor. She is divorced \nand has two adult children. She graduated from high school in 1979.  She has held a \nsecurity clearance  for about 20 years. She completed her security clearance application \n(SCA) on April 4, 2016. \n \nFinancial \n \n \nThe SOR alleges in 1.a-1.k, a 2012 Federal tax lien in the amount of $20,834;  \n2011 delinquent Federal taxes in the amount of $1,153.96; 2012 Federal delinquent taxes \nin the amount of $1,901.74; 2013 delinquent Federal taxes in the amount of $4,646.25; \n2014 delinquent Federal taxes in the amount of $828.90; 2015 Federal delinquent taxes \nin the amount of $3,223.10;  2016 delinquent Federal taxes in the amount of $458.72;  a \ncharged-off account in the amount of $113; a vehicle repossession balance of $8,862; a \ncollection account in the amount of $300; and a medical collection account for $63. \nApplicant admitted the financial allegations listed on the SOR and provided explanations. \n \n \nApplicant acknowledged that the tax lien and delinquent Federal taxes listed in \nSOR 1.a through 1.g are from 2011 to 2016. She explained that she timely filed her tax \nreturns for the years in question. (Tr. 43) Applicant explained that she helped her daughter \nfinancially and that was one reason for not paying the taxes. In her 2017 interview with \nan investigator, she thought that the original amount of $20,000 as a lien was due to her \nthen-husband filing jointly in 2008 and 2009, and his employer was not taking the correct \nwithholding amount of taxes from his pay. (GX 2)  Applicant stated that the tax bill was \ngiven to her in 2012. She thought her husband would take care of this bill, but he did not. \n(GX 2) In that interview, Applicant stated that she filed for a hardship notice with the IRS \nblaming her husband for the unpaid tax money, but she never heard anything from them. \nIn that same interview, she stated that she did not intend to pay that amount of money \nthat she believes her husband owes. (GX 2 at 12) \n \n \nAt the hearing Applicant explained that she has been in several payment plans \nwith the IRS beginning in April 2016. (Tr.44, GX 3) The first arrangement lasted for a \nperiod of time but was terminated by the IRS because Applicant did not maintain the $200 \n                                                          \n1 Applicant\u2019s personal information is extracted from her security clearance application (GX 1) unless \notherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. \n \n\n3 \n \nagreed upon monthly amount. (Tr. 46) She stated that she was between jobs, as she was \nterminated from a job in 2017. Applicant believes in June 2017, she started another \npayment arrangement, which was approved (AX C), but that was also terminated in \nAugust due to another tax obligation that was due. (Tr. 51)  In October 2018, Applicant \napplied for another payment agreement with the IRS. The IRS advised that  it is pending  \nand has not been approved. At this time, there is no payment plan in place. She presented \na \u201cpayoff calculator,\u201d which shows  a balance of $13,631.44 for taxes owed. (AX E) \n \n \nAs to SOR 1.h, a charged-off account in the amount of $113, this was a fraudulent \ncharge and she submitted documentation to prove the claim. (AE G ) \n \n \nAs to SOR i., Applicant explained that she co-signed for an auto loan for her \ndaughter. Her daughter testified at the hearing that she fell behind in the payments and \nthe car was repossessed. (Tr. 25) However, Applicant was not made aware of the \nsituation. Applicant\u2019s daughter paid the car loan in full and documentation was provided \nto support the assertion. (AE G) A small remainder of charges associated with the \nrepossession and storage are to be paid by Applicant\u2019s daughter who recently learned \nabout the charges. \n \n \nAs to SOR 1.j, a collection account in the amount of $300, Applicant has paid the \naccount in full and provided the receipt. (AE A) \n \n \nAs to SOR 1.k, the medical account for $63, Applicant did not know the origin of \nthe debt. She was later advised that it has been paid. (Tr. 62) She did not provide any \ndocumentation. \n \n \nApplicant provided documents and receipts for other accounts that she has paid in \na timely fashion. (AE F ) She also provided seven letters of recommendation from  a \nlandlord, church member and friends. Each letter attests to Applicant\u2019s charity, \ntrustworthiness and honesty. One of her former co-workers explained that she is a \nhardworking individual who has never had any difficulty with security violations. (AE F) \n \n \nA friend who has known Applicant for nine years stated that she is a loyal and \ndedicated professional as well as a caring friend. She always goes the extra mile. \nApplicant is described as dedicated, ethical and compassionate. (AE F) \n \n \nApplicant has not received financial counseling. Her net weekly pay is about $603. \n(AE B) She lives with a friend and pays for food and utility bills. She is current on her auto \nloan. She works overtime on occasions. She is current on her bills.  \n \n \nA co-worker testified that Applicant was always a dedicated security officer and  \nshe has known Applicant since 2010. She is also a personal friend of Applicant. The \nwitness described Applicant as detail oriented and always willing to do more to complete \ntask. (Tr. 32) \n \n \n\n4 \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nApplicant completed her SCA on April 4, 2016. In response to Section 26- Financial \nRecord delinquencies or tax delinquencies, Applicant responded \u201cNo.\u201d She did not list the \ndelinquent Federal taxes from 2011 to 2016. She also answered \u201cNo\u201d in that section as \nto whether she had any routine delinquent accounts. (SOR 2.a and 2.b) \n \n \nApplicant has held a security clearance for about 20 years. However, in 2017, she \nwas terminated from her employment for removing items from a trash can and giving \nvague explanations. (SOR 2.c) Applicant stated that she was escorting the cleaning crew \nand  saw a writing pad and some wrapped plastic cups in a trash can in one of the offices \nthat were being cleaned. She was seen on camera with them under her arm. The 2017 \ninterview confirms this information. (GE 2) There is no other infraction noted in the \ninterview. \n \n \nApplicant denied all SOR allegations under personal conduct. She admitted that \nshe had been terminated but disputed the facts given for the termination. She explained \nthat she prides herself on being trustworthy and honest. Applicant had filled out one SCA \nbefore in pen and paper. This application was online and she said she was at work and \nrushed. She also believed that since she had been on payment plans with the IRS that \nshe did not have to answer \u201cYes.\u201d She noted at the hearing she misunderstood the \nquestions and that she should have answered in the affirmative. She was credible in her \ntestimony that she was in no way trying to lie to the Government. (Tr. 72) She did not \nfalsify her application. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \n\n5 \n \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 at 3, \n1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993).   \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \n\n6 \n \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, corroborated by her credit reports, and failure to pay \nFederal   taxes that became delinquent, establish three disqualifying conditions under this \nguideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d); AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations\u201d); and 19(f) (\u201dfailure to  pay annual Federal,  state, or local income \ntax  as required.\u201d \n \n \nThe security concerns raised in the SOR may be mitigated by any of the following \npotentially applicable factors: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20 (g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \n \nApplicant  has a history of not paying Federal taxes consistently for multiple years \ngoing back to at least 2008 through 2016. Applicant  has a significant tax lien and owes \nback taxes. She started several payment arrangements over the years, but they were \n\n7 \n \nterminated. Her latest plan has not been approved, but is still pending. She is not in a \npayment plan. AG 20(a) does not apply.  She is divorced and claims that her husband \ncontributed to the $20,000 tax lien, but in a statement in an investigative interview she \nstated that she was not going to pay it because it is the responsibility of her husband. \nHowever, they had filed jointly. Some payments have been made, but she still has \nunresolved tax debt and a lien that is not resolved.  As to the collection accounts, \nApplicant provided sufficient documentation that she has paid the collection accounts and \nthat one was fraudulent. AG \u00b6 20(b) only partially applies because I do not find that her \nattempts to resolve the significant tax issues are responsible. The last arrangement that \nApplicant made with the IRS is pending from 2018. Considering the factors, her financial \nsituation is not under control at this time. AG 20 (c) (d )and (g) do not fully apply. \n \n \nApplicant has not received financial counseling and did not provide a budget. She \nhas paid the collection accounts listed in the SOR and provided documentation that she \nis current on her bills. However, she has furnished insufficient formation to show that she \nhas the tax problems under control. Applicant has not mitigated the financial \nconsiderations security concern.  \n \nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \u201cConduct involving \nquestionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules \nand regulations can raise questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. . . .\u201d Applicant\u2019s  history establishes \nthe following disqualifying conditions under this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 16(c): credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas \nthat is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information; \n \nAG \u00b6 16(d): credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under \nany other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This \nincludes, but is not limited to, consideration of . . . (2) any disruptive, violent, \nor other inappropriate behavior; [and] (3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule \nviolations; and \n \n\n8 \n \nAG \u00b6 16(e): personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's \nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress \nby a foreign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: (1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing . . . . \n \n \nApplicant did not falsify her 2016 SCA. She made a mistake. She admitted at the \nhearing that she was rushed and in hindsight she should have answered \u201cYes\u201d to section \n26. As to the termination, there is little or no evidence to dispute Applicant\u2019s explanation \nof her removing something from a trash can or that she did not follow a policy. She has \nnever had any incidents of criminal activity or security violations. She has been open and \ncandid about her past, thereby reducing any vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or \nduress. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nApplicant has held a security clearance for 20 years. She had started several \npayment plans with the IRS in 2018.  She has paid the delinquent collection accounts \nlisted in the SOR. However, despite several attempts, she is not in a current payment \nplan with the IRS.  \n \n \nShe is making some strides with her delinquent taxes and lien but she has not \npresented sufficient information to mitigate the security concerns raised by her unpaid \ntaxes. \n \n \nShe did not intentionally falsify her security clearance application in 2016, and has \nmitigated the personal conduct security concerns. \n \n \n\n9 \n \n. \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.g \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant:  \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h-k: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, (Personal Conduct): \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.c: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nClearance is denied. \n \n \n \n \nNoreen A.

Petcher, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant stopped paying on some of his credit-card accounts in 2014 in anticipation \nof filing a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition. He mismanaged his finances by taking on more \ndebt than he could repay. He settled two credit-card accounts by late January 2016, but \nother delinquencies went unpaid. The settlement of another debt after his security- \nclearance hearing is not enough to fully mitigate the concerns about his financial judgment. \nClearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn August 29, 2017, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security concerns \nunder Guideline F, financial considerations. The SOR explained why the DOD CAF was \nunable to find it clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue security \nclearance eligibility for him. The DOD CAF took the action under Executive Order (EO) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative \n10/12/2018\n\n2 \n \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to \nHold a Sensitive Position (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on October 4, 2017, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). \nOn April 18, 2018, the case was assigned to me to conduct a hearing to determine whether \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for \nApplicant. On April 23, 2018, I scheduled a hearing for May 15, 2018. \n \nAt the hearing, four Government exhibits (GEs 1-4) were admitted. A November 21, \n2017 letter forwarding the proposed GEs to Applicant and a list of the GEs were marked as \nhearing exhibits (HEs I-II) for the record but not admitted in evidence. Eighteen Applicant \nexhibits (AEs A-N) were admitted in evidence, and Applicant testified, as reflected in a \ntranscript (Tr.) received on May 23, 2018. \n \nI held the record open to June 5, 2018, for post-hearing submissions from Applicant. \nOn May 31, 2018, Applicant submitted five documents, which were admitted without \nobjection as AEs O-S. No additional documents were received by the deadline. \n \nSummary of SOR Allegations \n \n \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline F that, as of August 29, 2017, Applicant owed \ncharged-off credit-card balances totaling $31,287 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c and 1.e); a charged-off \nline of credit for $740 (SOR \u00b6 1.d); medical collection debt totaling $150 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f-1.i); \nand a credit-card collection debt of $670 (SOR \u00b6 1.j). When Applicant responded to the \nSOR, he admitted the charged-off debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.e. He denied the medical \ncollection debts based on his belief that they had been paid. He also denied the $670 \ncredit-card debt (SOR \u00b6 1.j) in that it was a duplicate listing of the charged-off credit-card \ndebt in SOR \u00b6 1.e, which had a then balance of $408. Applicant attributed his financial \nproblems to overspending and his own mismanagement. He twice rolled consumer-credit \ndebt into his mortgage to where his monthly mortgage payment exceeded half of his take-\nhome income. Applicant detailed some steps he has taken toward resolving his debts. \n(Answer.) \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nAfter considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I find that the debt in SOR \u00b6 \n1.j is an earlier balance of the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e and does not represent a new debt. \nAdditional findings of fact follow. \n \nApplicant is a 58-year-old software engineer with a bachelor\u2019s degree awarded in \nMay 1981. (GE 1; Tr. 57.) He and his spouse separated in 2014 after 23 years of marriage, \nalthough they were in the process of reconciling as of May 2018. (Tr. 59.) He and his \nspouse have two grown children, now ages 21 and 25. Applicant was granted a top secret \nsecurity clearance and sensitive compartmented information (SCI) access eligibility in \n2010. His latest background investigation was conducted while he was working for his \n\n3 \n \nprevious defense-contractor employer (company X). (GEs 1-2.) In January 2018, Applicant \nbegan working for another defense contractor, and he needs a secret clearance for his \ncurrent employment. (Tr. 23, 29, 58.) \n \nApplicant built his home in 1997. In 1998, he and his spouse obtained their first \nmortgage. (Tr. 64.) Over the years, he and his spouse relied on consumer credit for \npurchases. His spouse did not work outside the home for most of their marriage, but he \nearned enough income to where he did not see a need to monitor their spending or \nmaintain a household budget. Applicant earned $152,805 in 2000 while working as a \nconsultant. (GEs 1-2; AE A.) \n \nIn 2004, after about six months of unemployment (Tr. 63), Applicant began working \nin a permanent position as a principle software engineer with a commercial company at \nless income than as a consultant but with more security. His salary was $90,979 in 2005. \n(GE 1; Answer; AE E; Tr. 54.) In 2008, Applicant began working for company X. (GE 1; Tr. \n23.) \n \nApplicant twice refinanced the mortgage on his home to pay off some credit-card \ndebts. (GE 2; Answer; Tr. 50.) Available credit reports (GEs 3-4; AEs A-D) show he and his \nspouse obtained a 30-year mortgage loan in 2005 for $378,000, to be repaid at $2,263 per \nmonth. They made their mortgage payments on time for several years. (GE 3.) \n \nOn the death of his mother, Applicant inherited some funds in approximately 2012 \nthat he admits he mismanaged. (Tr. 86-87.) Despite some financial strain, his spouse \nrefused to look for work outside the home. (GE 2.) \n \nIn December 2013, Applicant notified his supervisor and security officer that, \nthrough financial mismanagement on his part, his monthly mortgage obligation was half of \nhis take-home pay. While he was not then behind on any accounts, he had accrued credit- \ncard debt over time. He indicated that he realized that he had to deal with his financial \nsituation and had engaged the services of a financial advisor. His mortgage loan was \ncurrent, but the principal balance was higher than his home was worth so a conventional \nrefinance was \u201call but impossible.\u201d Applicant added that he and his spouse were taking \nmeasures to further reduce their expenses and create additional income, including by \nselling assets. (AE A.) \n \nStruggling to make the monthly minimum payment on his credit-card debts, \nApplicant retained a bankruptcy attorney with the intention of filing a Chapter 13 wage-\nearner plan.1 (Tr. 66-67.) His income was too high for a Chapter 7 bankruptcy filing. (Tr. \n68.) In September 2014, Applicant updated his financial situation for his employer. He \nindicated that he planned to file for a Chapter 13 bankruptcy within the next 90 days and \n                                                 \n1 Applicant testified that he first talked to a bankruptcy attorney after he and his spouse separated, \u201cprobably \n[in] August or September of 2014.\u201d (Tr. 67.) However, he informed his then employer that he had stopped \npaying on his home loan and his credit-card accounts on the advice of the bankruptcy attorney in anticipation \nof the bankruptcy filing. Available credit reports show that he made no payments on some credit-card \naccounts after June 2014, so it is likely that he consulted with a bankruptcy attorney before August 2014.  \n\n4 \n \nexpected to pay a manageable $450 a month under his Chapter 13 plan. He had stopped \npaying his credit-card debts because they were to be included in the bankruptcy, and his \naccounts were 90 days past due. His mortgage loan was 60 days past due, but he was \nworking to refinance his loan through the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP). \nHis employer notified the government that Applicant was having some financial issues. (AE \nA.) \n \nFor a periodic investigation of his security clearance eligibility, Applicant completed \nand certified to the accuracy of a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) on \nNovember 3, 2015. In response to the financial record inquiries, Applicant indicated that he \nstopped paying on his credit cards on the advice of a bankruptcy attorney. His mortgage \nservicer was not willing to work with him before he fell behind 60 days on his loan and \nindicated that he would be filing a bankruptcy petition. He disclosed that he and his spouse \nwere currently working with their mortgage servicer to modify their loan under HAMP. \nApplicant indicated that he made some mortgage payments by selling assets, but it was \nnot a sustainable plan going forward. To obtain a modification under the HAMP, he needed \nto file a separation agreement with his wife, who would then sign a quitclaim deed. He \nanticipated that the modification of his mortgage would free up about $600 per month in \nincome. Applicant responded affirmatively to inquiries about financial delinquency on \nroutine accounts. He disclosed that he was delinquent on the accounts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \n($24,000), 1.b ($3,000), 1.c ($5,000), 1.d ($950), and 1.e ($1,000); on his home mortgage; \nand on two consumer credit-card accounts (not alleged in the SOR) that were past due for \n$6,000 and $8,000. Applicant attributed his consumer-credit delinquencies to his \nmismanagement of his inheritance and his sizeable mortgage obligation, which limited his \nability to make his credit card payments. He planned to resolve his credit-card debts by a \nChapter 13 bankruptcy filing. Applicant denied any intention to rely on consumer credit for \nany purchases in the future. (GE 1.) \n \nIn November 2015, the creditor owed the $8,000 debt agreed to settle Applicant\u2019s \nbalance of $7,027 for $2,811, payable in two payments of $1,405. (AE L.) The debt was \nsettled in December 2015. (GE 3.) Regarding the $6,000 credit-card delinquency reported \non his SF 86, Applicant obtained a credit card in May 2013 with a $6,000 credit limit. He \nmade no payments on the account after May 2014 and reportedly owed $6,127 as of \nDecember 2015. (GE 4; AEs B-D.) In approximately late January 2016, after the creditor \nsought a judgment against him (AE K), Applicant legally settled the debt for less than its full \nbalance.2 (AEs A-D.) \n \nApplicant and his spouse\u2019s mortgage loan was rated as past due throughout 2015. It \nwas past due for $9,805 as of November 2015, but was successfully modified in January \n2016. (AE A.) Applicant has been current on the mortgage payments since then. (GE 4.) \nAs of mid-January 2016, some of his credit-card accounts had been charged off, and some \nmedical debts were reportedly in collection for $30 (SOR \u00b6 1.g), $10 (SOR \u00b6 1.h), and $10 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.i). (GE 3.) \n                                                 \n2 The letter from the creditor indicating that the debt was settled is dated January 28, 2016. A court record, \ndated March 1, 2016, shows that the creditor voluntarily withdrew its action. (AE K.) The file does not include \nthe amount paid in settlement. \n\n5 \n \nAs of January 2016, Applicant had not filed for bankruptcy, apparently because his \nattorney \u201ckept trying to figure out the right formula\u201d for a Chapter 13 filing. (Tr. 68.) \nApplicant looked into alternative ways to address his debt, and, in early 2016, he \ndiscovered a \u201ccommonsense\u201d program advocated by a radio personality who reported \nsuccess in helping people out of debt. Applicant learned the value of budgeting, of having a \nlong-term financial plan, and of debt inhibiting the accumulation of net worth. He started \nselling some assets to build a cash emergency fund of $1,000. (Answer; Tr. 48-49.) He \nsold a 2007 or 2008 model-year vehicle, but he did not have enough money to make \nsettlement offers on most of his delinquent credit-card debts. (Tr. 68-69.) \n \n \nIn December 2016, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the \nOffice of Personnel Management (OPM). He admitted that he had mismanaged his \ninheritance and had neglected to manage his money. He had no explanation for his \noutstanding credit-card balances other than that he bought things that he did not need. He \ndescribed himself as \u201chouse poor\u201d because he had twice rolled credit-card debt into his \nhome mortgage loan. He explained that after he refinanced, he continued to charge items \non credit. On the advice of a bankruptcy attorney, he stopped paying on his some bills in \n2014 so that he would be eligible for a bankruptcy filing and \u201cspecial mortgage rewrite \nprograms.\u201d However, he later decided against filing for bankruptcy. He contacted some of \nhis creditors and began negotiating settlements. He indicated that he would be making \narrangements in early 2017 to settle other credit-card balances that had been charged off \nor placed for collection. Applicant denied using any credit cards after 2014. He paid down \nsome of his debt by withdrawing some 401(k) assets, and he expressed his intention to \nwithdraw the rest of the account (estimated at $31,000) to make debt payments. Applicant \nexplained that he did not want to withdraw all of his retirement funds in the same year \nbecause of the tax consequences and the loss of \u201cthousands of dollars.\u201d Applicant \nindicated that he was following the financial advice of a radio personality, who advocated \nrepaying smaller debts first, not applying for new credit, paying only in cash, and \nestablishing a budget. After he accumulated some emergency savings and improved his \ncredit score, he planned to refinance his mortgage loan from a 30-year to a 15-year loan. \nApplicant did not recognize the medical collection debts on his record, but indicated that he \nwould pay them if they were owed. (GE 2.) \n \nBy August 2017, Applicant had not made the promised payments toward his \nconsumer-credit delinquencies, and the DOD CAF issued the SOR. In October 2017, \nApplicant responded that he had $11,000 in reserve cash, $10,000 of which he would use \nto pay down debt. (Answer.) At his hearing, Applicant attributed the delay in addressing his \npast-due debts in part to \u201ctrouble making additions to the amount of money [he] had \nstashed.\u201d He was concerned that if he needed a new roof or a water heater, he might not \nhave the funds available to pay for them. (Tr. 75-76.) \n \n \nIn late January 2018, Applicant left company X for a higher-paying position with his \ncurrent defense contractor employer. His annual salary increased from $118,000 to \n$150,000, and he was paid a signing bonus of $15,000 after taxes. (Tr. 52, 99-100.) He \nspent about $1,000 of the bonus on tires for his spouse\u2019s vehicle, but could not account for \nthe rest of the money. (Tr. 87, 99-100.) \n\n6 \n \nAvailable evidence reflects the following delinquency and payment histories for the \nSOR debts as of June 2018: \n \nCharged-off credit card for $22,854 (SOR \u00b6 1.a) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s credit-card account with a credit union, which he opened in February \n1999, was charged off for $22,854 in December 2014. Date of last activity on the account \nwas April 2014. As of September 2017, Applicant had made no payment on the balance. \n(GEs 1-4; AEs A-D.) In mid-February 2018, after he received the signing bonus from his \ncurrent employer (Tr. 71), Applicant submitted an offer of $8,000 to the credit union to \nsettle the debt. (AEs J, M.) As of mid-May 2018, he had $9,000 in his emergency fund and \n$1,000 in his checking account, which was not enough to settle the debt, although he \ntestified that he had a small gun collection that he could sell for an estimated $10,000. (Tr. \n50, 72, 82.) He had $178,000 in a retirement account with company X that he could access \nbecause he is no longer employed by the company, although he was concerned about \nmaximizing his money.3 (Tr. 83.) In late May 2018, the credit union agreed to accept \n$12,190, payable by June 25, 2018, to settle the $22,854 balance. (AE Q.) Applicant \nexpressed an intention to withdraw some of his retirement funds to settle this debt and the \noverdraft debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d, but he was waiting for his accountant to inform him about the \ncorrect amount to withdraw so that he is \u201cprepared for any taxes due on both the settled \ndebts and the early withdrawal from [his] retirement.\u201d (AE S; Tr. 70.) As of the close of the \nevidentiary record, there was no evidence that the debt had been paid or settled. \n \nCharged-off credit card for $4,515 (SOR \u00b6 1.b) \n \n \nApplicant opened a credit-card account with a retailer in April 2011. His account was \ncharged off for $5,326 in December 2014 due to nonpayment after June 2014. (GE 3.) As \nof January 2017, the creditor was reporting a past-due balance of $4,515. (GE 4; AEs A-D; \nTr. 79.) On August 9, 2017, the creditor cancelled $3,472.86 of debt and issued a 1099-C, \nCancellation of Debt form to Applicant for tax year 2017.4 (AE I; Tr. 79.) Applicant testified \nthat he paid taxes on the amount of cancelled debt (Tr. 54), although he provided no \ncorroborating documentation. \n \n Charged-off credit card for $3,510 (SOR \u00b6 1.c) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s credit-card account with a retailer, which he opened in October 2011, \nwas charged off and placed for collection for $3,510 in June 2015 after nonpayment since \n                                                 \n3 When asked whether he would be willing to withdraw retirement assets to pay the $22,854 debt, Applicant \nresponded: \n \nIf it comes down to it, I\u2019m going to have to. I don\u2019t want to, but only because, as it stands, the \nfuture value of that $22,000 comes out to more like half a million in 12 to 14 years, at roughly \n8 to 9 percent growth. (Tr. 83.) \n \n4 Applicant testified that he called the creditor several times about a settlement, the first time in \u201croughly\u201d \nNovember 2017, but the creditor elected to cancel the debt. (Tr. 73.) The 1099-C shows that the creditor \ncancelled the debt before November 2017.  \n\n7 \n \nNovember 2014. (GEs 1-4; AEs A-D.) In mid-May 2018, the creditor agreed to settle the \ndebt for $1,580 payable in a lump sum by June 16, 2018. Applicant paid the $1,580 on \nMay 24, 2018. (AE P.) \n \nCharged-off credit line for $740 (SOR \u00b6 1.d) \n \n \nApplicant opened an overdraft-protection account in April 2002 with a $1,000 limit. In \nlate January 2015, a $740 balance was charged off to profit and loss. (GEs 1-4; AEs A-D.) \nIn mid-February 2018, Applicant notified the creditor of his willingness to pay the full \nbalance to settle the debt. (AE J.) On May 30, 2018, the creditor gave him until June 25, \n2018, to pay the debt. (AE Q.) He expressed his intention to withdraw retirement funds to \npay the debt. (AE S.) As of the close of the record, there was no evidence that the debt \nhad been paid or settled. \n \nCharged-off credit card for $408 (SOR \u00b6 1.e, duplicated in SOR \u00b6 1.j) \n \n \nApplicant opened a credit-card account with a home-improvement retailer in \nSeptember 2001. He made no payments on the account after June 2014, and a $670 \ncollection balance was owed as of June 2015. (GE 1, 3.) As of November 2016, the \ncreditor was reporting a charged-off $408 balance. (GE 4; AEs A-D.) Applicant had not \npaid the debt by late May 2018. He expressed an intention to pay the debt after his debts \nwith the credit union (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.d) have been settled. (AE M; Tr. 54.) \n \nMedical collection debt for $100 (SOR \u00b6 1.f) \n \n \nIn September 2016, a $100 medical debt from March 2016 was placed for \ncollection. (GE 4; AEs B-D.) Applicant asserted in October 2017 that the debt was for \nservice at a medical center and that it had been paid off for a long time. (Answer.) \nAvailable billing information for outpatient surgery at the medical center in March 2016 \nshows that $100 was paid by credit card on February 3, 2017, and he had no outstanding \nbalance as of May 2018. (AE G.) Available credit reports confirm that the debt was paid in \n2017. (AEs B-D.) \n \nMedical collection debt for $30 (SOR \u00b6 1.g) \n \n \nIn November 2015, a $30 medical debt from June 2015 was placed for collection. \n(GEs 3-4.) Applicant asserted in October 2017 that the debt was a medical co-payment \nthat he paid at the time of service. (Answer.) The debt was still on his credit record as of \nJanuary 2017, but the information showing the outstanding collection balance was from \nDecember 2015. (GE 4.) The debt was not on his credit record with Equifax as of May \n2018.5 (AE C.) Applicant presented a document from a medical practice, showing that he \n                                                 \n5 Applicant presented credit reports from Trans Union (AE B), Equifax (AE C), and Experian (AE D) dated May \n10, 2018. Trans Union listed no collection debts. Equifax listed only the collection debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f. Applicant \nentered in evidence an incomplete copy of his Experian credit report, which does not include the collections \nsection. \n\n8 \n \nhad a zero balance on his account as of May 2018 (AE H), although there is no evidence to \ntie the medical provider to the collection debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g-1.i.  \n \nMedical collection debt for $10 (SOR \u00b6 1.h) \n \n \nIn July 2015, a $10 medical debt from February 2015 was placed for collection. \n(GEs 3-4.) Applicant asserted in October 2017 that the debt was a medical co-payment \nthat he paid at the time of service. (Answer.) While the debt was still on his credit record as \nof January 2017, the information showing the outstanding collection balance was from \nNovember 2015. (GE 4.) The debt was not on his credit record with Equifax as of May \n2018. (AE C.) \n \nMedical collection debt for $10 (SOR \u00b6 1.i) \n \n \nIn April 2015, a $10 medical debt from October 2014 was placed for collection. (GEs \n3-4.) Applicant asserted in October 2017 that the debt was a medical co-payment that he \npaid at the time of service. (Answer.) While the debt was still on his credit record as of \nJanuary 2017, the information showing the outstanding collection balance was from June \n2015. (GE 4.) The debt was not on his credit record with Equifax as of May 2018. (AE C.) \n \n \nApplicant has no open credit-card accounts for which he is legally responsible. (GE \n4; AEs B-D.) He pays cash for purchases. (Tr. 82.) Applicant and his spouse\u2019s joint \nmortgage loan had a balance of $290,772 as of May 2018. Monthly payments on the loan \nof $2,880 were being paid on time. The current interest rate on the loan is 5.99%. He \nwould like to refinance for a 15-year loan with a lower interest rate. (Tr. 53.) Applicant \ncosigned a student loan for his older daughter. The loan has a balance of $27,029 that his \ndaughter was repaying at $234 per month. His credit was rated as fair by the credit- \nreporting agencies. (AEs B-C; Tr. 62.) His budget for June 2018 showed that his monthly \nexpenses equal his income with $1,000 going toward his retirement and almost $745 to his \nemergency fund. (AE R.) He testified that he will never again become financially \noverextended. (Tr. 56.) He asserted that he has had a monthly surplus of about $1,000 \nsince his first paycheck with his current employer in February 2018. (Tr. 80.) However, he \nadmitted that he had not stayed within his budget in that $750 of the $1,000 was being \nspent every month on activities such as \u201ceating out too often.\u201d He also purchased a ham \nradio and two other minor items. (Tr. 81-83.)  \n \n \nAs of May 2018, Applicant\u2019s first priority was retaining his home. His younger \ndaughter and her husband live with him. (Tr. 50, 62.) His daughter gives him $120 a month \nto offset the cost of her cellphone plan and her car insurance. (T. 61.) In May 2018, he paid \n$2,500 for a class for his daughter to help her obtain a higher-paying job. (Tr. 81, 88.) \nApplicant has had no other large, unexpected expenses in the last two years. (Tr. 88.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor at company X from 2008 until January 2018 corroborated that \nApplicant self-reported that he had financial issues. To his knowledge, Applicant had \nviolated no security practices or procedures. He observed Applicant to handle classified \ninformation appropriately. He recommended continued security clearance eligibility for \n\n9 \n \nApplicant with the caveat that Applicant reconcile his financial situation. He understands \nthat Applicant left company X in part to fix his financial situation. (Tr. 24-30.) \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n \n \n\n10 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concerns about financial considerations are articulated in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness \nto abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Financial distress can also be caused or exacerbated \nby, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of personnel security \nconcern such as excessive gambling, mental health conditions, substance \nmisuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \n \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial considerations \nsecurity concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) (citation omitted) \nas follows: \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money in satisfaction of \nhis or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the totality of an \napplicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge must consider \npertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nqualities essential to protecting the national secrets as well as the \nvulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive presumes a \nnexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines and an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility. \n \nApplicant mismanaged his personal finances by taking on more consumer-credit \ndebt than he could reasonably afford to repay. He twice refinanced the mortgage loan on \nhis home to address credit-card debt. By 2014, the principal balance of his mortgage loan \nexceeded the value of his home, and he was struggling to make the monthly minimum \npayments on some credit-card accounts. He stopped paying on his home loan so that his \nlender would work with him to modify his home loan under HAMP. In anticipation of a \nbankruptcy filing that never occurred, he stopped paying on some credit-card accounts and \non an overdraft-protection account. As of his November 2015 SF 86, Applicant owed \ncharged-off balances totaling $32,027 on five accounts listed in the SOR (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.e). \nHe candidly disclosed on his SF 86 that two additional credit-card accounts were \ndelinquent for approximately $14,000 (credit information shows the balances totaled \n$13,154). Those two debts were not alleged in the SOR, presumably because they were \nsettled for less than the full balances in December 2015 and January 2016. The unalleged \ndebts cannot provide grounds for disqualification because they were not alleged. The \n\n11 \n \nevidence of delinquency on the other accounts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.e) is more than ample to \nraise financial considerations security concerns. \n \nAvailable credit information indicates that four medical debts totaling $150 were \nplaced for collection (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f-1.i) between April 2015 and September 2016. Applicant \nasserts that the debts were paid at the time of service and were erroneously reported as \ncollection debts. Under \u00b6 E3.1.14 of the Directive, the government has the burden of \npresenting evidence to establish controverted facts.  The Appeal Board held in ISCR Case \nNo. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010) that a credit report is sufficient to meet the \ngovernment\u2019s burden of producing evidence of delinquency: \n \nIt is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally \nmeet the substantial evidence standard and the government\u2019s obligations \nunder [Directive] \u00b6 E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the burden \nshifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not responsible for the \ndebt or that matters in mitigation apply. \n \nThe small medical debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g-1.i were still on Applicant\u2019s credit record as \nof January 2017, but there had been no update to the delinquency information since 2015. \nThe credit-reporting agencies were no longer reporting the debts on his credit report as of \nMay 2018. The Fair Credit Reporting Act requires removal of most negative financial items \nfrom a credit report seven years from the first date of delinquency or the debt becoming \ncollection barred because of a state statute of limitations, whichever is longer.6 Debts may \nbe dropped from a credit report upon dispute when creditors believe the debt is not going \nto be paid or when the debt has been charged off. The mere fact that debts have been \ndeleted from a credit report does not necessarily mean that they were not owed at one \ntime. Applicant presented medical billing records from providers that show zero balances, \nalthough there is no information tying the collection debts to those providers. Even so, \nthose debts are so minor ($30, $10, and $10) that they have likely been paid, perhaps after \ncollection. Regarding the $100 medical collection debt (SOR \u00b6 1.f), the evidence shows \nthat Applicant paid $100 to the provider medical center on February 3, 2017, for services \nincurred in March 2016. The debt appears to have been paid after it was placed for \ncollection, but before the SOR was issued. \n \nAlthough collection debt raises some questions about financial judgment, the \nprimary concern in this case is with Applicant\u2019s admitted overspending on credit cards and \nmismanagement of his consumer-credit accounts. Applicant is not required to be debt free, \nbut he is required to manage his finances in a way as to exhibit sound judgment and \nresponsibility. Three disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19 apply: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n                                                 \n6 Title 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681c. See Federal Trade Commission website, Summary of Fair Credit Reporting Act \nUpdates at Section 605, https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/pdf-0111-fair-credit-reportingact.pdf.   \n  \n\n12 \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(e) consistent spending beyond one\u2019s means or frivolous or irresponsible \nspending, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant \nnegative cash flow, a history of late payments or of non-payment, or other \nnegative financial indicators. \n \nThe burden is on Applicant to mitigate the evidence of financial delinquency. One or \nmore of the following conditions under AG \u00b6 20 may apply: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem from a \nlegitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling service, \nand there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) has some applicability in that the consumer-credit debts became \nseriously delinquent in 2014. They were not incurred recently. However, the Appeal Board \nrecently affirmed that unresolved debts are a continuing course of conduct. See ISCR \nCase No. 17-03146 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 31, 2018) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-08799 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Nov. 3, 2017)). As of Applicant\u2019s security clearance hearing in May 2018, \nApplicant had not made any payments to satisfy or settle the delinquencies in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-\n1.e, although one creditor (SOR \u00b6 1.b) cancelled his debt in 2017.7 \n \n                                                 \n7 The 1099-C shows that $3,472.86 of debt was cancelled. As of January 2017, Equifax was reporting a \n$4,515 charged-off balance. It is unclear whether the creditor would pursue Applicant for what may be interest \non the delinquency that was not included in the amount of debt cancelled. \n\n13 \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) has limited applicability. Although Applicant may not have had any \ncontrol over his spouse, who was unwilling to find work outside the home for the income \nthat they needed to pay their debts, he caused his own financial difficulties by excessively \nrelying on credit cards; taking on higher mortgage debt to pay off credit cards; and \nmismanaging his inheritance. Applicant showed good financial judgment in several aspects \nsince 2014. Chiefly, he stopped using credit cards and opened no new accounts. He \nmodified his home loan successfully in January 2016, and his loan has been current since \nthem. In 2016, he established a plan to address his financial issues, starting with \naccumulating reserve funds for an emergency and budgeting for expenses. Yet, it is \ndifficult to find that he has acted fully responsibly under AG \u00b6 20(b) when he gave so little \npriority to addressing his known consumer-credit delinquencies. By his December 2016 \ninterview with an OPM investigator, he had already decided against filing for bankruptcy. \nHe indicated that he would make repayment arrangements with his creditors in early 2017. \nHe had no repayment plans established for his delinquent credit-card debts as of August \n2017 despite annual employment income exceeding $100,000. The creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.b \ncharged off his account for $3,472.86 in August 2017 and would not agree to a settlement, \nbut there is no indication that his other creditors were unwilling to work with him had he \nmade timely efforts to address his debts. \n \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) partially apply. Applicant settled two non-alleged delinquent \ncredit-card accounts shortly after he completed his SF 86, although it must be noted that \nthe debts were settled after collection, and in the case of the $6,127 credit-card debt, after \nthe creditor had sought a financial judgment against him. On May 24, 2018, Applicant paid \n$1,580 in full settlement of the $3,510 debt (SOR \u00b6 1.c). It was not established that he \ncurrently owes any medical collection debt. AG \u00b6 20(e) apply to the medical debts and to \nthe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.j, which alleges an earlier balance of the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e and is not \nan additional delinquency. \n \n \n In February 2018, Applicant proposed to settle the $22,854 charged-off debt (SOR \n\u00b6 1.a) for $8,000 and to full satisfy the $740 charged-off debt (SOR \u00b6 1.d). The credit union \nis willing to settle the debts for $12,190 and $740. Despite his annual salary of $150,000 \nand a signing bonus of $15,000 after taxes, Applicant did not have sufficient reserve funds \nto meet the terms. As of the close of the record, he was planning to use retirement assets \nto pay the debts, but he was reportedly seeking advice from his accountant to ensure that a \nretirement withdrawal would not lead to future financial difficulties. He had no pending \nsettlement offer or repayment arrangements with the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.e, although he \nexpressed an intention to pay the debt after he resolved his charged-off balances with the \ncredit union. Applicant is not required to pay off every debt in the SOR to be granted \nsecurity clearance eligibility. All that is required is that he has established a plan to resolve \nhis financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan. See ISCR Case \nNo. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). However, the record does not support his \npost-hearing assertion (AE S) that his SOR debts have been fully resolved, and concerns \npersist about his financial judgment. \n \nOf the $32,027 in alleged credit-card delinquency, Applicant has not resolved \n$24,002 in defaulted debt on three accounts. While it may have been financially \n\n14 \n \nadvantageous for him to accumulate assets in the case of an emergency, his delay in \naddressing his past-due debts was also caused by consideration of his own finances and \nhis failure to comply with his budget. He did not want to lose \u201cthousands of dollars\u201d by \npaying the full $22,854 owed the credit union. He spent $1,000 of his signing bonus on \ntires for his spouse\u2019s vehicle, but he could not account for the remainder of his bonus. \nBased on his current income, Applicant should have $1,000 a month in discretionary \nincome to pay down his debts. He admitted at his hearing that he was spending about \n$750 of those funds by eating out and buying discretionary items, such as a ham radio. \nWhile he has not incurred new debt by those expenditures, his discretionary income could \nhave gone toward paying his remaining delinquent obligations. The Government must be \nassured that persons with security clearance eligibility can be counted on to fulfill their \nobligations, even when it may be personally disadvantageous to do so. For the reasons \nnoted, Applicant has raised some doubt in that regard. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nIn assessing the whole person, the administrative judge must consider the totality of \nan applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). The analysis under Guideline F is incorporated in my whole-\nperson analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but \nsome warrant additional comment. \n \n \nThe security clearance adjudication involves an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness in light of the security guidelines in the Directive. \nSee ISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). Applicant handled classified \ninformation appropriately even when he was having serious financial difficulties, and he is \ncredited with self-reporting his financial issues to his former employer. However, it is well \nsettled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, \nthere is a strong presumption against the grant or renewal of a security clearance. See \nDorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990).

The SOR \nfurther informed Applicant that, based on information available to the government, DoD \nadjudicators could not make the preliminary affirmative finding it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on December 14, 2017, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. (Answer.) The case was assigned to me on February 6, \n2018. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing \non February 12, 2018, scheduling the hearing for March 20, 2018. The hearing was \nconvened as scheduled. The Government offered Exhibits (GX) 1 through 3, which \nwere admitted without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf and presented two \nsets of documents, which I marked Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AppXs) A and B, and admitted \ninto evidence. The record was left open until April 17, 2018, for receipt of additional \n\n \n2 \n \ndocumentation. On April 17, 2018, Applicant offered AppX C, which was also admitted \ninto evidence.  DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (TR) on March 28, 2018. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted to the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a., and 2.b. He denied SOR \nallegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.a., and 3.a. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, \nexhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 41-year-old employee of a defense contractor. (TR at page 18 line \n23 to page 19 line 9, and GX 1 at page 5.) He has been employed with the defense \ncontractor since \u201cApril of\u201d 2017. (GX 1 at page 5.) Applicant was terminated by his prior \nemployer in September of 2015 for \u201cPolicy Violations,\u201d that will be discussed at length, \nbelow. (GX 3.) He served in the Marine Corp from 2000~2006, achieving the rank of \nSergeant. (AppX C at page 3.) \n \n \nGuideline M - Use of Information Technology, Guideline K - Handling Protected \nInformation & Guideline E - Personal Conduct \n \n \n \n1.a., 2.a. and 2.b. Applicant admits that at his prior employment he installed \nunauthorized software, a Mouse Jiggler,\u201d which prevented his \u201cscreen from locking out.\u201d \n(TR at page 24 line 23 to page 31 line 6.) He avers that he was \u201cunaware that it was \nunauthorized,\u201d as he was introduced to it \u201cby a senior administrator that(sic) was acting \nas a mentor to . . . [Applicant] at that time.\u201d (Id, and TR at page 84 lines 4~17.) Applicant \nhas offered five undated letters of support from those he works with at his current \nemployer, but nothing to corroborate averment regarding the unauthorized software. \n \n \n1.a., and 3.a. Applicant denies that he created five administrated accounts, some \nin the names of coworkers, on a classified system without approval. (TR at page 31 line \n7 to page 45 line 8, at pages 50 line 15 to page 51 line 3, and at page 55 line 11 to page \n68 line 5.) He avers this misconduct was authorized. (TR at page 83 line 25 to page 84 \nline 3.) However, Applicant has submitted nothing further in support of his averment. \n \n \n1.a. Applicant denies that he falsified his time card over a seven day period. (TR \nat page 45 line 19 to page 50 line 14.) His \u201cDesktop\u2019 was monitored by his employer for \nseven of a planned ten days. (AppX A at page 1.) During this period, Applicant \u201cspent\u201d \nthe majority of his \u201cActive Time on Non-Work related activities . . . included doing \nhomework, browsing online retailers, and watching YouTube videos.\u201d (Id.) I find that this \nwas a clear misuse of information technology. \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n\n \n3 \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration \nof the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline M - Use of Information Technology \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Use of Information Technology \nis set out in AG \u00b6 39:  \n \nFailure to comply with rules, procedures, guidelines, or regulations \npertaining to information technology systems may raise security concerns \n\n \n4 \n \nabout an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, calling into question \nthe willingness or ability to properly protect sensitive systems, networks, \nand information. Information Technology includes any computer-based, \nmobile, or wireless device used to create, store, access, process, \nmanipulate, protect, or move information. This includes any component, \nwhether integrated into a larger system or not, such as hardware, \nsoftware, or firmware, used to enable or facilitate these operations.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 40. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(e) unauthorized use of any information technology system; and \n \n(f) introduction, removal, or duplication of hardware, firmware, software, or \nmedia to or from any information technology system when prohibited by \nrules, procedures, guidelines, or regulations or when otherwise not \nauthorized \n \n \nApplicant downloaded an unauthorized Mouse Jiggler on his employer\u2019s laptop. \nThis conduct is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 41 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 41 including: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n \n(b) the misuse was minor and done solely in the interest of organizational \nefficiency and effectiveness; \n \n(c) the conduct was unintentional or inadvertent and was followed by a \nprompt, good-faith effort to correct the situation and by notification to \nappropriate personnel; and \n \nd) the misuse was due to improper or inadequate training or unclear \ninstructions. \n \n \nNone of these apply. This deliberate manipulation of his employer\u2019s \ninformation technology system was intentional, not authorized, and occurred only \nabout two and a half years prior to his hearing. Guideline M is found against \nApplicant.  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nGuideline K - Handling Protected Information \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Handling Protected Information is set \nout in AG \u00b6 33:  \n \nDeliberate or negligent failure to comply with rules and regulations for \nhandling protected information-which includes classified and other \nsensitive government information, and proprietary information-raises doubt \nabout an individual's trustworthiness, judgment, reliability, or willingness \nand ability to safeguard such information, and is a serious security \nconcern. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 34. One is potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(g) any failure to comply with rules for the protection of classified or \nsensitive information. \n \n \nApplicant created five administrative accounts in the names of colleagues on his \nclassified system without approval. This conduct is sufficient to raise the above \ndisqualifying condition. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 35 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 35 including: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior, or it has happened so \ninfrequently or under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the individual responded favorably to counseling or remedial security training \nand now demonstrates a positive attitude toward the discharge of security \nresponsibilities; \n \n(c) the security violations were due to improper or inadequate training or unclear \ninstructions; and \n \n(d) the violation was inadvertent, it was promptly reported, there is no evidence of \ncompromise, and it does not suggest a pattern. \n \n \nAgain, none of these apply. Although his misconduct occurred more than two \nyears ago; I can\u2019t overlook the fact that it was deliberate and intentional, and Applicant \nshows no remorse for said conduct. Guideline K is found against Applicant.   \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. \n  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under  \nAG \u00b6 16. One is potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nThis includes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of \nclient confidentiality, release of proprietary information, \nunauthorized release of sensitive corporate or government \nprotected information; \n \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; \n \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and \n \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other \nemployer's time or resources; \n \n  \nApplicant has a demonstrated pattern of rule violations. The evidence is sufficient \nto raise these disqualifying conditions.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 including: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a \nperson with professional responsibilities for advising or instructing the \nindividual specifically concerning security processes. Upon being made \n\n \n7 \n \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activities was unwitting, \nhas ceased, or occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon \nthe individual's reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations. \n \n \nNone of these apply. Applicant falsified his time cards, downloaded unauthorized \nsoftware, and created unauthorized administrative accounts. What is most troubling is \nthat Applicant shows little or no remorse for his Personal Conduct. Guideline E is found \nagainst Applicant.   \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n\n \n8 \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines M, K, and E in my whole-person analysis. Applicant is well respected with \nhis current employer. (AppX C.) However given his pattern of rule violations, overall, the \nrecord evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant \nmitigated/failed to mitigate the Use of Information Technology, Handling Protected \nInformation, and Personal Conduct security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline M:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline K:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. National security eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nRichard A. Cefola \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Applicant has been employed by federal \ncontractors since 2001.2 \n \n \nThe debts alleged in the SOR are corroborated by Applicant\u2019s admissions and \ncredit reports from March 2016 and July 2017.3 \n \nApplicant attributed his delinquent debts to his ex-wife who he said managed their \nfinances and was responsible for paying their bills. They had agreed early in their \nmarriage that she would handle the finances. He had always lived frugally and was raised \nin a fiscally responsible family. He first learned that she was not paying their bills in 2001 \nor 2002. He testified he had been saving money to take a trip. When he went to withdraw \nthe money, the account was empty. Applicant stated that this happened several times. \nEach time his wife told him she had used the money to pay bills. He admitted to being \nnaive. He wanted to believe she was doing the right thing. He was unaware that her \nspending habits were escalating, and her purchases were for high-end and luxury items. \n                                                          \n1 Hearing Exhibit (HE) I is the Government\u2019s discovery letter. HE II is Applicant\u2019s email submitting additional \ndocuments. HE III is Government Counsel\u2019s email noting there were no objections to Applicant\u2019s additional \nexhibits. Applicant\u2019s attorney timely submitted additional documents that he marked as AE O and P. He \npreviously submitted exhibits marked AE O and P. I have remarked the additional exhibits as AE Q and R.  \n \n2 Tr. 32-36, 95; GE 1.  \n \n3 GE 1, 3, 4. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nHe stated he was never a shopper and did not notice her expensive choices. She used \ncredit cards to purchase these items.4  \n \nWhen Applicant and his wife divorced, as part of the marital distribution, he \nreceived the house and was responsible for the two mortgages (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-$49,696 and \n1.d). He was also responsible for the credit card debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f ($7,548). The house \nwas foreclosed. In 2015, he received an IRS Form 1099-A, abandonment of secured \nproperty from the lender. He testified he filed the form with his federal income tax returns.5 \nApplicant remained responsible for the second mortgage (SOR \u00b6 1.a).6  \n \n \nIn April 2016, Applicant\u2019s ex-wife filed Chapter 13 bankruptcy to address the \nmarital debts she was responsible for in the divorce decree. Included in her bankruptcy \nwere the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, 1.f and 1.g. Applicant testified that he never discussed \nincluding his debts in her bankruptcy. He is listed as the co-debtor for the debts in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, and 1.g. Applicant provided a notarized letter from his ex-wife that she is \ncurrent on her Chapter 13 bankruptcy payments. Applicant testified that he did not pursue \nresolving any of the debts that his ex-wife included in her bankruptcy. He assumed they \nwould be resolved by the bankruptcy. They are being paid through the bankruptcy.7 \n \n \nApplicant admitted responsibility for the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e ($9,726). He made \npayment arrangements in September 2013 and paid $35 until December 2017. He \nincreased his payments to $100 in January 2018 and has made consistent payments.8 \nThis debt is being resolved. \n \n \nApplicant testified that he has participated in financial counseling. He provided a \ndetailed written budget. His wife is employed and he manages their finances. He has \nsavings and investments. He provided copies of awards and character letters. He is \ndescribed as outstanding, hardworking, responsible, valued, honest and trustworthy.9  \n \n \nA character witness testified that he has known Applicant for 11 months and \nconsidered him knowledgeable and experienced. He has never seen him act \n                                                          \n4 Tr. 39-44; Answer to the SOR. \n \n5 AE O. \n \n6 Tr. 42-47, 53-61, 86-88; GE 5, 6. \n \n7 Tr. 43-94; GE 3, 4; AE A, L, M, N, Q. Although the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.f are being paid through \nApplicant\u2019s ex-wife\u2019s Chapter 13 bankruptcy, Applicant, as the joint owner and co-debtor may still be liable \nfor the debts once his ex-wife\u2019s bankruptcy is discharged. Applicant is also listed in the bankruptcy as co-\ndebtor for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.g. \n \n8 Tr. 49-50, 61-67; AE K, R. \n \n9 Tr. 51-52, 73-81; AE E, G, H, I, J.  \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nuntrustworthy. A second witness testified that he has known Applicant for a year. He \nconsiders him very reliable and honest.10 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \n                                                          \n10 Tr. 22-32. \n\n \n5 \n \n \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG & 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant had delinquent debts that he failed to pay or resolve for several years. \nThere is sufficient evidence to support the application of the above disqualifying \nconditions. \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \n\n \n6 \n \n \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \n \nApplicant and his first wife divorced in 2014. He testified that she mismanaged \ntheir finances and failed to pay their creditors. Their divorce decree divided their \ndelinquent debts. She was not held solely responsible for the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and \n1.f. However, in order to resolve her debts she filed Chapter 13 bankruptcy and included \nall of the delinquent debts in the SOR, except SOR \u00b6 1.e. Applicant is making payments \non this debt. His ex-wife is making the Chapter 13 payments. At this juncture, Applicant \nprovided evidence that his current finances are stable. AG \u00b6 20(a) has some application. \n \n \nApplicant testified that his financial problems were the result of his ex-wife\u2019s \nmismanagement. This was somewhat beyond his control. For the full application of AG \u00b6 \n20(b), Applicant must have acted responsibly. Applicant was aware as early as 2001 and \nat other times throughout his marriage that his wife was mismanaging their finances. \nHowever, he continued to let her handle the finances and did not provide oversight. He \nwas aware of the problem when he attempted to use money from his savings and \ndiscovered she had depleted it. He did not act responsibly under the circumstances. AG \n\u00b6 20(b) has minimal application.  \n \n \nApplicant received financial counseling and there are clear indications that his \nfinancial problems are being resolved and under control. AG \u00b6 20(c) applies. Applicant\u2019s \nex-wife included the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.f in her bankruptcy, both of which \nApplicant remains potentially responsible. Applicant\u2019s ex-wife is making the Chapter 13 \npayments. Applicant has a payment plan for the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e and is making \nconsistent payments. AG \u00b6 20(d) applies to the SOR debts.  \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n\n \n7 \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n \nApplicant is 46 years old. During his first marriage he and his wife accumulated \nnumerous delinquent debts. Applicant was aware she was mismanaging their finances, \nbut trusted her to resolve the problem. They eventually divorced and their debts were \ndivided, holding each accountable for certain ones. His ex-wife filed Chapter 13 \nbankruptcy and all of the debts in the SOR, except \u00b6 1.e, are being paid through the \nbankruptcy. Applicant may become legally liable at some point. He is making payments \non the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e. Currently, Applicant\u2019s finances are stable. He has met his \nburden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves me with no questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising under Guideline F, financial \nconsiderations. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph   1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph   1.b:  \n \nWithdrawn \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.c-1.g: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nCarol G.

Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is granted.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn August 18, 2017, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline F (financial \nconsiderations). The action was taken under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines \n(AG) implemented by DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant responded to the SOR on September 13, 2017, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge.

Despite these \nfactors, he traveled overseas for tourism in 2009 and 2015. He testified that by the time \nof his 2017 background interview, he was already in the process of trying to resolve \nsome of his delinquent accounts, to include SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c.

He became \ndelinquent because he did not have the money to pay for necessary repairs. He \nestablished a $200 monthly payment plan in September 2017 that was scheduled to \nbegin in October 2017 and continue through September 2020. With the exception of \nmissing two monthly payments in February and March 2018, he testified that he has \notherwise abided by the plan. He did not provide documentation to corroborate his claim \nof payments for this debt.5 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b is for a $651 delinquent auto account that Applicant cosigned for his \nwife. He testified that he was unsure why the account became delinquent because she \nwas responsible for paying it. He testified that she brought the account current in \nDecember 2017, and he expected that the account would be fully paid by September \n2018. His most recent credit reports from May 2018 corroborate his claim that this \naccount is current.6   \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c is for a $574 charged-off credit card.

He provided documentation corroborating his payment.10 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e is for Applicant\u2019s Chapter 7 bankruptcy filed in 2008 and discharged in \n2009. He listed liabilities totaling $25,692. Applicant testified that he was advised to file \nbankruptcy because of his inability to pay around $25,000 in medical bills that he \nincurred after a 2001 car accident. He acknowledged that he included a personal loan \nand another car loan in his bankruptcy.11 \n \n \nApplicant testified that he does not have any other delinquent debts. He indicated \nthat he consolidated $25,000 in student loans, which he was paying at $300 monthly. \nHis May 2018 credit reports reflect that he has two student loans in collection for $1,001 \nand $1,404, respectively. He testified that he received financial counseling as part of his \n2008 bankruptcy, and his church pastor was also assisting him with getting his finances \ntogether. He indicated that he and his wife enrolled with a credit-counseling company in \nMay 2018. He intended to clean up his credit report, to include $1,500 in charges that \nhe incurred in 2010 when his identity was stolen, though he received reimbursement by \nhis bank for such unauthorized charges.12  \n \n \nApplicant indicated that he and his wife manage their finances together. He \nprovided a copy of their monthly budget, reflecting a monthly net remainder of \napproximately $1,500, which can vary depending on changes to their expenses that can \noccur during certain times in the year. He testified that while they are able to meet their \nmonthly expenses, at times they are overextended by around $500. He testified that he \nhas a 401k retirement savings account of around $600, and he believes his wife also \nhas such an account though he did not know the balance. He testified that he has \nalways received favorable ratings on his performance evaluations. He provided \ndocumentation to show that he received numerous certificates of appreciation from his \nemployers over the years. His current annual income is approximately $60,000, from \n$18,000 in 2001, which included a recent pay raise.13 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \n                                                     \n10 Tr. at 39-40, 65-66; GE 4; AE B. \n \n11 Tr. at 40-42, 68-69; GE 1, 2, 3, 4, 5; AE C. \n \n12 Tr. at 42-80; GE 2; AE C. \n \n13 Tr. at 42-80; GE 2; AE C. \n\n \n5 \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of Exec. Or. 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Exec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \n\n \n6 \n \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . . \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case:  \n  \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant was unable to pay his debts. The evidence is sufficient to raise AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n19(a) and 19(c) as disqualifying conditions.  \n \n  \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nConditions beyond Applicant\u2019s control, as previously discussed, contributed to his \nfinancial problems. Thus, the first prong of AG \u00b6 20(b) applies. For the full application of \nAG \u00b6 20(b), he must provide evidence that he acted responsibly under his \ncircumstances. He filed and received a Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge once, after he \nincurred significant medical costs from a 2001 car accident that he could not afford to \npay on his limited income. He also provided documentation to show that he resolved \n\n \n7 \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, and 1.g. through 1.l. AG \u00b6 20(b) applies to his past bankruptcy and \nthese eight debts.  \n \nApplicant did not provide documentation to corroborate his claims of payment \nfor SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.d, and 1.f. However, he indicated that he paid SOR \u00b6 1.d, he \nintended to re-contact the creditor for SOR \u00b6 1.f to dispute and close out any \noutstanding accounts, and neither SOR debts are reported on his recent credit reports. \nI find that AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and 20(e) apply as to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.f.  \n \nWhile Applicant did not provide documentation to corroborate his claims of \npayment for SOR \u00b6 1.a, he indicated that he was in the process of paying it. He also \nindicated that he was working with his pastor and a credit-counseling company to \nresolve any remaining delinquent accounts. A security clearance adjudication is an \nevaluation of an individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. It is not a debt-\ncollection procedure. See ISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). The \nadjudicative guidelines do not require that an individual make payments on all \ndelinquent debts simultaneously, pay the debts alleged in the SOR first, or establish \nresolution of every debt alleged in the SOR. He or she need only establish a plan to \nresolve financial problems and take significant actions to implement the plan. See \nISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). \n  \nAs such, there is sufficient evidence to conclude that Applicant acted responsibly \nunder his circumstances to address his delinquent debts. His finances are under control \nand there is sufficient evidence to conclude that his financial problems are unlikely to \nrecur. His debts do not cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(c), 20(d) are established as to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.l. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n\n \n8 \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Overall, the record evidence leaves me \nwithout questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. I conclude Applicant mitigated the financial considerations security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a \u2013 1.l: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nCandace Le\u2019i Garcia \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Nerney, Esq. \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nHESS, Stephanie C., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant mitigated the potential security concerns raised by his 2012 one-time \nillegal drug use, his 2014 positive drug test, and his failure to timely file and pay his 2010 \nstate taxes. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (e-QIP) on February 24, 2016. \nOn August 29, 2017, the Department of Defense (DOD) sent him a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR), alleging security concerns under Guidelines H (Drug Involvement), F (Financial \nConsiderations), and E (Personal Conduct). The DOD acted under Executive Order (Ex. \nOr.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) implemented by DOD on June 8, 2017.  \nApplicant submitted his Answer to the SOR on September 18, 2017, and requested \na hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on \nNovember 1, 2017, and the case was assigned to me on March 20, 2018. On May 22, \n03/25/2019\n\n2 \n \n2018, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant through \ncounsel that the hearing was scheduled for June 7, 2018. I convened the hearing as \nscheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 5 were admitted into evidence without \nobjection. Applicant testified, called six witnesses, and Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through \nI were admitted without objection. I left the record open until June 14, 2018, to enable \nApplicant to submit additional documentary evidence. He timely submitted AX J, which I \nhave admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on June 14, 2018. \n  \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 31-year-old electronics technician currently employed by a defense \ncontractor since February 2016. He received his general equivalency degree in 2005. He \nserved on active duty in the U.S. Army from July 2008 until April 2013, when he received \na general discharge. He was granted a secret security clearance while on active duty. \n(GX 1; Tr. 18-19.)  \n \nUnder Guideline H, the SOR alleges that in November 2012, while on active duty, \nApplicant tested positive for cocaine. He received an Article 15 and was fined, sentenced \nto extra duty, placed on restriction for 45 days, and reduced in rank. He was later \nseparated from the Army with a general discharge. Applicant tested positive for opiates \nin 20141 while enrolled in a Veterans court deferred program after having been arrested \nand charged for suspicion of driving under the influence of alcohol. Under Guideline F, \nthe SOR alleges that Applicant failed to file and/or pay state taxes for tax year 2010. \nFinally, the SOR cross-alleges the Guidelines H and F allegations under Guideline E. \nApplicant admits the cocaine-related allegation, and that he tested positive for opiates, \nhowever, he denies having ever used opiates. He admits that he did not timely file or pay \nhis 2010 taxes, but states that he has since resolved all his tax obligations. Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. \n \nIn November 2012, Applicant was 24 years old and on active duty in another state. \nHe was living in an off-base apartment complex where other soldiers who he worked with \nalso lived. Applicant was at a party that was attended by soldiers and civilians who lived \nin the apartment complex. Applicant was drinking alcohol. One of the civilians, with whom \nApplicant was previously acquainted, offered Applicant cocaine. He made a \u201cpoor \ndecision\u201d and tried the cocaine. Later that month, Applicant tested positive for cocaine in \na random urinalysis. He was ultimately separated from the Army with a general discharge. \n(GX 2; Tr. 38-40.) Although unalleged, Applicant held a security clearance at the time he \ntried cocaine, and his clearance was revoked when he was separated. (GX 2.) He regrets \nhis behavior and considers it to be a serious mistake. Applicant has not used any illegal \ndrugs or misused prescription drugs on any other occasion. (Tr. 41-49.) Applicant \nprovided a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof his security clearance. (AX F.) He moved back to his home state and does not \nassociate with any of the people who were at the party or anyone else who uses illegal \ndrugs. (Tr. 41.)  \n                                                          \n1 Applicant's positive urinalysis was actually on July 6, 2014, not in November 2014,as alleged in the SOR. AX H. \n\n3 \n \nIn July 2013, Applicant was arrested and charged with suspicion of driving under \nthe influence of alcohol (DUI). The previous night, Applicant met up with a friend in the \nfriend\u2019s hometown and they took a cab to a bar. Applicant had left his vehicle at his friend\u2019s \napartment complex. His friend left the bar before Applicant, who later took a cab back to \nhis friend\u2019s apartment. Applicant\u2019s friend was not home, so Applicant slept in his vehicle. \nWhen he awoke, his cell phone battery was dead. Applicant was attempting to drive home \nwhen he was pulled over for speeding. The officers smelled alcohol on Applicant, had him \nperform field a sobriety test, and asked him to take a breathalyzer. Applicant refused the \nbreathalyzer and was arrested for suspicion of DUI. (Tr. 41-43.) \n \nThe DUI charge was referred to the veterans court where Applicant\u2019s case was \nplaced in a deferral program. Applicant was required to pay approximately $1,200 in fines \nand court costs. The program required that Applicant call in every day for one year to find \nout whether or not he was scheduled for urinalysis on that day. In July 2014, Applicant \ntested positive for opiates, specifically morphine, on a random urinalysis. Applicant \nadamantly denies any use of any type of opiate ever, and does not have an explanation \nfor the positive test result. His drug screenings from the day before and five days after the \npositive result were both negative. (Tr. 45-49; Tr. 56-61.) Applicant\u2019s 39 other random \ndrug screenings were negative. (AX H.) Protocol for testing positive for drug use was 48 \nhours in jail and an additional 6 months in the program. Applicant spent 48 hours in jail, \nbut was not given any additional time. Applicant successfully completed the deferral \nprogram in November 2014. (AX I.) He has not had any subsequent alcohol-related \nevents. (Tr. 70.) His voluntary June 2018 drug screening was negative. (AX J.) \n \nWhile in the Army, Applicant was deployed overseas for just under one year in \n2010 and 2011. He did not file his state tax return or pay his state taxes owed for tax year \n2010 because he mistakenly thought he was exempt due to his deployment. When \npreparing his 2011 tax returns, Applicant realized he was required to file his 2010 state \ntax return and filed it with his 2011 return. However, Applicant did not pay the 2010 taxes \nowed at that time. Between 2011 and 2016, the state retained Applicant\u2019s refunds to offset \nthe balance owed by Applicant, which was approximately $250. Applicant fully paid the \nbalance owed for his taxes before September 2017. Applicant timely filed and paid \nFederal and state taxes for all other tax years including 2018. (GX 2; Tr. 72-77; AX G; Tr. \n52.) \n \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor, site lead, and operations lead testified that they have \nknown Applicant since February 2016 and are aware of the SOR allegations. Collectively \nthey consider Applicant to be trustworthy, reliable, and a person of strong moral character. \nThey do not think that Applicant\u2019s past mistakes are reflective of the person his is today. \n(AX A; Tr. 14-33.) Applicant\u2019s field support lead, site supervisor, and assistant program \nmanager have also worked with Applicant since February 2016 and consider his honesty \nand integrity to be unquestionable. (AX A.) Each of Applicant\u2019s character references \nhighly recommend Applicant for a security clearance. (AX A; Tr. 14-33.) Applicant was \nsincere, candid, and humble while testifying. \n \n \n\n4 \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant\u2019s meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 at 3, \n1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993).  \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \n\n5 \n \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse  \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 24:  \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances . . . can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, corroborated by the record evidence, establish the \npotentially disqualifying conditions under this guideline:  \n \nAG \u00b6 25(a) any substance misuse. \n \nThe following mitigating conditions may also apply: \n \nAG \u00b6 26(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 26(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment were drugs were used; and \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \n \n\n6 \n \n \nApplicant used cocaine on one occasion in 2012, more than six years ago. He was \npunished and ultimately separated from the Army with a general discharge as a result of \nthis conduct. He has not used cocaine or any other illegal substance since 2012. Over \nthe course of one year from November 2013 until November 2014, as a requirement of a \ndeferral program for a DUI arrest, Applicant underwent 40 random drug screenings, 39 of \nwhich were negative. In July 2014, more than four years ago, Applicant tested positive \nfor morphine. He adamantly and consistently denies having used any opiate or any other \nillegal or illicit substance. He does not have an explanation for what he deems was a false \npositive result. His voluntarily drug screening in June 2018 was negative. He successfully \ncompleted the deferral program. He does not have a social circle that includes people \nwho use illegal substances.  \n \nApplicant recognizes that his decision to use cocaine was a mistake, accepts \nresponsibility for his actions, and has provided a written statement in which he \nacknowledges the use, states his intent of no future use of any illegal drugs, and \nrecognizes that any such use will result in the loss of his security clearance.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s single use of cocaine in 2012 and his 2014 positive drug screening are \nnot recent. The Directive does not define \"recent,\" and there is no \"bright-line\" definition \nof what constitutes \"recent\" conduct. ISCR Case No. 03-02374 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 26, \n2006). The Judge is required to evaluate the record evidence as a whole and reach a \nreasonable conclusion as to the recency of an applicant's conduct. ISCR Case No. 03- \n02374 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 26, 2006). He will not use any illegal substance in the future. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b) apply.  \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness \nto abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n \nThe following disqualifying condition applies: \n \nAG \u00b6 19(f): failure to file . . . annual Federal, state, or local income tax \nreturns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired.  \n\n7 \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \n \nApplicant failed to timely file and pay his 2010 state taxes because he thought his \n2010 to 2011 deployment made him exempt from being required to file and pay. Upon \nlearning of his error, Applicant filed his 2010 state tax return when he timely filed his 2011 \nreturn. However, Applicant did not pay the past-due taxes of approximately $250 at that \ntime. The state withheld Applicant\u2019s refunds for several years, then Applicant paid the \nremaining balance prior to September 2017. Applicant\u2019s failure to timely file and pay his \nstate taxes was due to a misunderstanding of the tax requirements, not a willful disregard \nfor rules or regulations. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and 20(g) apply. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nAny potential personal conduct concerns are mitigated for the reasons set forth \nunder the analyses of Guidelines H and F. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n\n8 \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines H, E, and F in my whole-\nperson analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under those guidelines, \nbut I have also considered the following: \n \n \nApplicant is highly regarded and trusted by his supervisors and site and program \nleads. Applicant\u2019s one-time use of cocaine while holding a security clearance places a \nheavy burden on Applicant to establish mitigation. After considering the record as a \nwhole, specifically, the circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s age and the circumstances \nof his one-time use of cocaine, the length of time that is passed since that single use, and \nApplicant\u2019s remorse for his actions, I conclude that applicant has met his heavy burden \nof proof and persuasion. Applicant\u2019s cocaine happened under circumstances that are \nunlikely to recur, and does not cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment. Applicant\u2019s testimony was credible and sincere.  \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines H, E, \nand F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has mitigated the security concerns raised by his past conduct. Accordingly, I \nconclude he has carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nAs required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, I make the following \nformal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H (Drug Involvement):  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline F, (Financial Considerations): FOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline E (Personal Conduct):  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \nStephanie C. Hess \nAdministrative Judge \n\n9 \n \n \n \n",

His last alcohol-related \nmisconduct occurred two years ago. He has demonstrated a sufficient pattern of \nmodified behavior for me to conclude that the questionable judgment associated with \nhis alcohol-related incidents is behind him. I believe he will continue to consume alcohol \nresponsibly to maintain his eligibility for a clearance. The alcohol consumption and \ncriminal conduct security concerns are mitigated. Clearance is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on May 3, 2016. (GE \n1) He provided a statement during an interview with a government background \ninvestigator on March 20, 2017, and answered interrogatories on September 28, 2017. \n(GE 2) After reviewing the information gathered during the background investigation, the \nDepartment of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on October 4, \n2017, alleging security concerns under Guidelines G (alcohol consumption) and J \n(criminal conduct). Applicant answered the SOR on November 8, 2017, and requested a \n12/13/2018\n\n \n2 \n \n \nhearing before an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA).  \n \nDOHA assigned the case to me on April 13, 2018, and issued a notice of hearing \non June 8, 2018, setting the hearing for June 26, 2018. Applicant requested a delay to \nretain an attorney, and the hearing was rescheduled for July 10, 2018. At the hearing, \nthe Government offered twelve exhibits (GE 1 through 12). Applicant testified, \npresented the testimony of an expert witness, and submitted eight exhibits (AE 1 \nthrough 8). All exhibits were admitted without objection. DOHA received the hearing \ntranscript (Tr.) on August 7, 2018. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his SOR answer, Applicant denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b, and admitted SOR \u00b6 \n1.c. He submitted comments in mitigation and explanation. Because SOR \u00b6 2.a cross \nalleges the same facts alleged in SOR \u00b6 1, he submitted the same answers for both \nSOR paragraphs. His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a \nthorough review of the record evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact:  \n \nApplicant is 53 years old. He graduated from high school in 1983, and shortly \nthereafter, he enlisted in the U.S. Navy. He honorably served on active duty until his \ndischarge in 1989. (AE 5) He possessed a clearance while in the service. He married in \n1991 and divorced in 1998. He has an adult son of this marriage.  \n \nApplicant has been working for federal contractors since 2001. He has received \ngood evaluations and is well-regarded by his employers. (AE 4) He noted that of the \n160 employees working for his employer in 2006-2007, only he and 12 other employees \nhave been continued to present. Applicant has been promoted twice, and has \npossessed a clearance since 1993. His clearance was upgraded to top-secret in 1996, \nwhich has been continued to present. He seeks the continuation of his clearance which \nis required for his work with his current employer.  \n \nIn response to Section 22 (Police Record) of his 2016 SCA, Applicant disclosed \nhe was involved in an alcohol-related conviction for malicious bodily injuring (a felony) in \nApril 2010. He arrived at a bar at about 7:30 p.m. to watch a couple of hockey games, \nand left the bar at about 1:45 a.m. He testified that he only drank four beers during the \nsix-hour period. Applicant claimed that on his way home he was threatened by a man \nwho was also at the bar watching the games. He assaulted the man. Applicant was \nfound guilty at a jury trial of malicious bodily injuring, and required to make restitution of \n$1,250. Applicant claimed he was not intoxicated, and that he was the victim to a bad \ninvestigation. \n \nIn April 2011, Applicant arrived at a bar for dinner and to watch some games. He \nclaimed that he only consumed four beers over a six to seven-hour period. At about 2 \na.m., when the bar closed, Applicant went to a restaurant to eat. After a couple of hours \nat the restaurant, he was involved in an altercation with three police officers. Alcohol \n\n \n3 \n \n \nuse was noted in the police report. He was charged with resisting arrest, obstructing a \npolice officer, and disorderly conduct. The charges were later dismissed due to the \npolice officers\u2019 failure to appear. Applicant repeatedly claimed he was not drunk and that \nhe was the victim of police misconduct. \n \nDuring his March 2017 interview with a government investigator, Applicant \ndisclosed that he was convicted of driving under the influence (DUI) of alcohol in 2016. \nApplicant and coworkers went to a bar to eat and celebrate the completion of a job. \nThey arrived at the bar at about 8:00 p.m., and stayed until the bar closed at 2 a.m. \nApplicant claimed he consumed four beers and two shots of scotch. He was arrested \nwhile weaving on the road. He pleaded guilty to DUI and was sentenced to one-year \nprobation; fined $2,000; driver\u2019s license was suspended for one year, with driving \nprivileges for work; breathalyzer in the car, and to attend VA ASAP classes. He has \ncomplied with all the terms of his sentence. (AE 7) \n \nApplicant reported all the above incidents to his facility security officer and in his \nSCA. He has continued to consume alcoholic beverages, but averred he drinks once a \nweek, three to four beers per occasion. Applicant denied having a drinking problem. \nThere is no evidence to show that he has been diagnosed with any alcohol use \ndisorder. He credibly testified that he has learned a valuable lesson as a result of his \nDUI conviction. He no longer drives after consuming alcohol. He now uses the services \nof taxis, a designated driver, or ride-sharing companies to avoid drinking and driving. \n \nApplicant submitted five favorable reference statements. (AE 8) He is considered \nto be responsible, dependable, hardworking, diligent, honest, and trustworthy. His \nreferences lauded his work ethic, performance, knowledge, and specialized skills. They \nrecommended his eligibility for a clearance. His supervisor noted that Applicant follows \nsecurity rules and procedures.  \n \nPolicies \n \nThe SOR was issued under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive) \n(January 2, 1992), as amended; and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for \nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a \nSensitive Position (AGs), applicable to all adjudicative decisions issued on or after June \n8, 2017.  \n \nEligibility for access to classified information may be granted \u201conly upon a finding \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). \n\n \n4 \n \n \nThe AGs list disqualifying and mitigating conditions for evaluating a person\u2019s \nsuitability for access to classified information. Any one disqualifying or mitigating \ncondition is not, by itself, conclusive. However, the AG should be followed where a case \ncan be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to \nclassified information. Each decision must reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense \nconsideration of the whole person and the factors listed in SEAD 4, App. A \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) and \n2(f). All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, must be considered.  \n \nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government \nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, \nthe burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. The \napplicant bears the heavy burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue his or her security clearance.  \n \nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interest as their own. \nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n\u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \nEgan, 484 U.S. at 531; SEAD 4, \u00b6 E(4); SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 1(d) and 2(b). Clearance \ndecisions are not a determination of the loyalty of the applicant concerned. They are \nmerely an indication that the applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines the \nGovernment has established for issuing a clearance. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 21: Excessive alcohol \nconsumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure to \ncontrol impulses, and can raise questions about an individual's reliability and \ntrustworthiness. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s alcohol-related incidents in 2010, 2011, and his 2016 DUI, where he \nexcessively consumed alcohol to the point of impaired judgment, establish the following \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: \n \nAG \u00b6 22(a): alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving \nwhile under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the \npeace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the \nindividual's alcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with \nalcohol use disorder; and \n\n \n5 \n \n \nAG \u00b6 22(c): habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of \nimpaired judgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with \nalcohol use disorder. \n \n \nThe security concerns raised under this guideline have been mitigated by the \nfollowing applicable factors under AG \u00b6 23: \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment;  \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations; and \n \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with \ntreatment recommendations. \n \n \nApplicant acknowledged that he exercised extremely poor judgment by driving a \nvehicle after having consumed alcohol to the point of intoxication in 2016. There is no \nevidence of any further alcohol-related misconduct after his 2016 DUI. Although \nAppellant continues to consume alcohol, he has demonstrated a pattern of responsible \nconsumption of alcohol. He has also taken the necessary precautions, by designating a \nsober driver or using a ride-sharing service, to avoid driving a vehicle on any occasion \nthat he has consumed any amount of alcohol. In nearly two years since his DUI, he has \ndemonstrated a sufficient pattern of modified behavior for me to conclude that the \nquestionable judgment associated with his alcohol consumption is behind him.  \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 30: Criminal activity creates \ndoubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it \ncalls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s 2010 and 2011 alcohol-related incidents, and his 2016 DUI conviction \nestablish the following disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 31: \n \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \n\n \n6 \n \n \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and  \n \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \n \n \nThe security concerns raised under this guideline have been mitigated by the \nfollowing applicable factors under AG \u00b6 32: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \n \n \nIncorporating my comments under Guideline G, AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and 32(d) are \nestablished to mitigate the DUI conviction given the evidence of Applicant\u2019s modified \nbehavior and responsible consumption of alcohol. Applicant has demonstrated a \nsufficient pattern of modified behavior for me to conclude that the questionable \njudgment associated with his alcohol-related incidents, and 2016 DUI conviction are \nbehind him. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nappellant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of an appellant\u2019s conduct and all \nrelevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual=s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \n\n \n7 \n \n \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines G and J in my whole-person analysis. \n \nApplicant, 53, served six years in the Navy, and has been working for federal \ncontractors since 2001. He has possessed a clearance during most of his service and \nperiod working for federal contractors. There is no evidence of any other security \nconcerns aside from those alleged in the SOR. \n \nApplicant\u2019s criminal conduct concerns are primarily the result of his alcohol use. \nHis last alcohol-related misconduct occurred two years ago.

The action was taken under Executive Order (Exec.\nOr.)10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as\namended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance\nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and Security Executive\nAgent, by Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (SEAD 4). \n01/16/2019\n\nApplicant responded to the SOR on September 7, 2017, and requested a\nhearing. The case was assigned to me on March 20, 2018. The Government\u2019s case\nconsisted of five exhibits that were admitted without objection (GEs 1-5). Applicant\nrelied on one witness (himself) and 21 exhibits that were admitted without objection\n(AEs A-U). The transcript of the proceedings (Tr.) was received on June 14,  2018.\nSummary of Pleadings\n \nUnder Guideline  G, Applicant allegedly was arrested and charged with multiple\nalcohol-related offenses between August 1984 and January 2016. Alleged offenses are\nas follows: (a) Driving Under the Influence (DUI) and possession of marijuana in\nJanuary 2016; (b) open container in April 2015; (c)  DUI in March 2005; and (d) DUI in\nAugust 1984.\nUnder Guideline E, Applicant allegedly (a) received an administrative separation\nfrom the Army in May 2005 for misconduct and testing positive for cocaine in November\n2004, for which he was awarded non-judicial punishment (NJP) for both this offense\nand his March 2005 alcohol-related offense.\nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted each of the alcohol-related\nallegations with explanations. He claimed the state of the offense covered by\nallegations covered by SOR \u00b6 1.a was mistaken. He claimed the charges covered by\nSOR \u00b6 1.b were reduced to an open container citation that produced a fine of $96 with\nall other charges dismissed. He further claimed to have voluntarily enrolled in an\nalcohol outpatient program as the result of his April 2015 open container offense and\ncontinues to live a very healthy and regimented life. Applicant claimed also to have\naddressed mental health issues with Veterans Affairs (VA) personnel. \nAddressing the remaining allegations covered by Guideline G, Applicant claimed\nto have paid the $200 fine associated with the citation issued in connection with the\nalleged April 2015 open container incident. He claimed responsibility for poor judgment\nin connection with his March 2005 DUI offense and satisfied all of the court-imposed\nrequirements in connection with his conviction, inclusive of AA meetings, community\nservice, and fines. And, he claimed he paid the ordered fine and completed the ordered\ndrivers course program in satisfaction of the court\u2019s requirements in connection with his\nAugust 1984 DUI offense.\nResponding in detail to the allegations covered by Guideline E, Applicant\nprovided detailed explanations of the circumstances associated with his May 2005\nadministrative separation from the Army. He claimed responsibility for his 2005 DUI\nincident, and for his award of NJP and his ensuing administrative separation from the\nArmy.\nFinally, Applicant offered regrets for his past actions and claimed credit for his\nongoing efforts to limit his alcohol consumption to infrequent drinking. Applicant claimed\nhe has been administered numerous urinalyses with negative results. He claimed he \nhas enjoyed good success with his work and has been actively committed to\n2\n\nwarehousing and logistics work for over 25 years. Applicant adopted his SOR response\nas part of his testimony.\nFindings of Fact\n Applicant is a 53-year-old logistics analyst for a defense contractor who seeks a\nsecurity clearance. The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by Applicant are\nadopted as relevant and material findings. Additional findings follow.\nBackground\n                               \nApplicant married in February 1988 and divorced in September 1999. (GEs 1-2;\nTr. 30) He has no children from this marriage, but he has a nephew that he has\nmentored since childhood, who recently earned his bachelor\u2019s degree and is pursuing a\nPh.D. (AE G; Tr. 74-75) Applicant earned an associate\u2019s degree with honors in July\n2008 and a bachelors degree in human resources with honors in December 2013. (AEs\nM-N; Tr. 49-50) \nApplicant enlisted in the Army in October 1992 and served 12 years of active\nduty (including two tours of duty in Iraq). He received a general discharge under\nhonorable conditions in May 2005 for cited misconduct attributable to a positive drug\ntest for cocaine in November 2004. (GEs 1-2 and AEs G and K; Tr.  33, 52-53) Like his\nfather before him, Applicant enjoyed his military service. (Tr. 53-55)\nSince October 2015, Applicant has been employed by his current contractor.\n(GEs 1-2 and AE K) Applicant\u2019s responsibilities involve managing and tracking\nGovernment-furnished equipment. (AE K) He reported brief unemployment between\nSeptember 2015 and October 2015 and prior employment with federal contractors, \ninterspersed with periods of unemployment. (GEs 1-2 and AE K)  Applicant has held a\nsecurity clearance since April 2007 and currently retains one. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 37, 85) \nAlcohol-history\nBetween August 1984 and January 2016, Applicant was involved in four alcohol-\nrelated incidents. His most recent incident occurred in January 2016. (GEs 1-3 and AE\nA; Tr. 40, 65) He was arrested by city police for DU), first offense, after refusing a\nbreathalyzer test at the scene. (Tr. 65-66) Possession of marijuana and open container\nwere added charges. Applicant had consumed quite a bit of alcohol the previous night\nbefore his arrest. He could not provide any information on the source of the marijuana\nand open container found in his truck. (GE 2) In court, he initially pled not guilty to all\ncharges. (AE D) in his March 2016 court appearance, he entered a guilty plea to the\nopen container charges and was fined $250. (GEs 2-3 and AE B and D; Tr. 40, 66) The\nremaining charges of DUI and marijuana possession were dropped. (GE 2) Applicant\npromptly reported his January 2016 incident to his employer. (GE 5; Tr. 39-40)\nRecords confirm that Applicant was cited in April 2015 for open container while\nriding as a passenger in a vehicle driven by an unidentified individual. (GEs 2-3 and AE\n3\n\nD; Tr. 41-42) Applicant was issued a citation for open container after officers on the\nscene found an open beer in the vehicle. (GEs 2-3; Tr. 63) Applicant was subsequently\nconvicted and fined for the misdemeanor offense, which he paid. (GEs 2-3 and AE D;\nTr. 42)  No evidence of drinking was produced at the scene.\nYears prior to his April 2015 alcohol-related incident, Applicant was involved in\ntwo other alcohol-related incidents. (GEs 2-3 and AE D) In March 2005, he was\narrested and convicted of DUI. (GEs 2-3 and AE E; Tr. 44) He was fined $1,153 and\nwas ordered to complete 80 hours of community service and participate in an Army\nsubstance abuse program. Applicant was also placed on probation for six months. (GEs\n12 and AE C; Tr. 61-62) Applicant complied with the court\u2019s orders and attended\nvoluntary alcohol counseling sessions. (GE 2 and AE E; Tr. 44-45). \nWorthy of note, Applicant\u2019s counselors made no diagnostic finding of alcohol\ndependence. (AE E; Tr. 58)  And in August 1984, Applicant was arrested for DUI after\nbeing stopped by police for speeding. Appearing in court, Applicant pled guilty to DUI\nand paid the ordered fine. (GEs 2-3) \nBetween March 2005 and April 2015, Applicant encountered no other alcohol-\nrelated incidents.  Since his January 2016 alcohol-related incident, he consumes very\nlittle alcohol (two to three beers at most) and has never abused alcohol. (Tr. 47-48, 81)\nAnd, since March 2017, he has maintained sustained abstinence. (Tr. 48, 69, 76, 81-\n82) \nApplicant self-referred himself to an alcohol-treatment facility in March 2016 for a\nsubstance abuse screening inventory (SASSI) evaluation. (AE C; Tr. 43-44, 69)\nApplicant\u2019s screening was evaluated by a masters-level therapist, and he received an\nSASSI assessment of low probability. He was advised as a precaution to enter the\nfacility\u2019s Phase I DUI program in September 2017. (AE H) He is credited with\ncompleting the program\u2019s prescribed 20  sessions that consisted of individual therapy\nsessions and attendance of 15 twelve-step meetings with Alcoholics Anonymous (AA).\n(AEs I, K, and R; Tr. 71-72)) While enrolled in the program, he addressed issues\nrelated to impact of alcohol addiction, and voluntarily submitted to random drug\nscreens. (AEs H; Tr. 68-69) These drug screens produced negative results for both\nillegal substances and alcohol. (AE I; Tr. 80) Based on his demonstrated progress in\nthe program, he was assigned a good prognosis.\nApplicant continues to attend regular AA meetings and is committed to avoiding\nfuture alcohol abuse. (AEs R-S; Tr. 47-48, 70-71, 76-78, 82-84) Although he does not\nhave a sponsor, he regularly attends his scheduled weekly mixed meetings and\nsometimes leads the meetings. (Tr. 83-84) In his AA meetings, he recites the serenity\nprayer, drinks the traditional black coffee, and still works the 12 steps. (Tr. 85-86)\nIn his November 2017 statement of intent, Applicant certified his intent to never\nabuse alcohol again with the understanding that should he engage in future alcohol\nabuse, he consented to the automatic revocation (even if not covered required by the\n4\n\nregulations) of his security clearance. (AE S; Tr. 49-50) Applicant\u2019s stated intentions\nimpress to be sincerely made and are accepted.\nDrug-related issues\nIn May 2005, Applicant was administratively separated from the Army for cited\nmisconduct, after testing positive for cocaine in November 2004, and following his\nMarch 2005 DUI incident. Applicant denied any knowing ingestion of cocaine, attributing\nit to his consuming spiked drinks at a party containing cocaine ingredients. Still, he\nadmitted to his command that he ingested cocaine before he was tested. (GE 4; Tr. 56-\n57) \nAfter admitting his wrongful use of cocaine before testing positive for the\nsubstance, Applicant was awarded NJP by his command in January 2005. (GE 4 and\nAE E; Tr. 32-33) Punishment consisted of reduction in rank and assignment to 45 hours\nof extra duty. Applicant  accepted the test results and ensuing administrative separation\nand general discharge without contesting the results with appeals or other means. (GE\n2; Tr. 59-60) \nBefore testing positive for cocaine, Applicant had never knowingly used or\npossessed illegal drugs of any kind. (GE 2; Tr. 70) And, since his 2004 positive drug\ntest, he has avoided use and possession of all illegal substances. (Tr. 70) \nIn his November 2017 statement of intent, Applicant certified his intent to never\nuse illegal drugs again or associate with anyone who uses illegal drugs with the\nunderstanding that should he ever violate illegal drug use laws and policies, he\nconsented to the revocation of his security clearance. (AE S; Tr. 49) Applicant\u2019s stated\nintentions impress to be sincerely made and are accepted.\nEndorsements, certifications, evaluations, and awards\nApplicant is highly regarded by his current and former supervisors, coworkers,\nand friends who know him and have worked with him. (AEs G and L; Tr. 45-46) Aware\nof his clearance issues, they attested to his solid work ethic, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness. (AEs G and L; Tr. 46) \nApplicant\u2019s employment credits include strong performance evaluations and\ndocumented clearances and certifications of course completions in unit level logistics,\nleadership development, and combat lifesaving. (AE Q) Past performance evaluations\n(2015-2016) credit him with meets and exceeds requirements in all rated categories.\n(AE U)\nAmong his decorations, medals, citations, and ribbons he received in recognition\nof his military service, and noted in his DD 214 Certificate of Release and Discharge are\nthe following: Army Commendation Medal (4  award), Army Achievement Medal, (3\nth\nrd\naward), Presidential Unit Citation, (Army-Air Force); Army Good Conduct Medal (4th\naward); National Defense Service Medal (2d award); Global War on Terrorism\n5\n\nExpeditionary Medal; Global War on Terrorism Service Medal; and Non-Commissioned\nOfficer\u2019s Professional Development Ribbon. (AE G; Tr. 60)\nPolicies\nThe AGs list guidelines to be used administrative judges in the decision-making\nprocess covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that could\ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as\nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information. These guidelines include conditions that could raise a\nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying\u201d (disqualifying conditions), if any, and many\nof the conditions that could mitigate security concerns.\u201d  \nThe AGs must be considered before deciding whether or not a security\nclearance should be granted, continued, or denied. The guidelines do not require\nadministrative judges to place exclusive reliance on the enumerated disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a decision. Each of the guidelines is\nto be evaluated in the context of the whole person in accordance with AG \u00b6 2(c). \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, administrative judges must take into account the\npertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in AG \u00b6 2(d)\nof the AGs, which are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial\ncommonsense decision based upon a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines\nwithin the context of the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine\na sufficient period of an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made\nabout whether the applicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be\nconsidered together with the following AG \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and\nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral chances; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual\nguidelines are pertinent in this case:\n         Alcohol consumption \nThe Concern: Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the\nexercise of questionable judgment or the failure to control impulses, and\ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.\nAG \u00b6 21.\n6\n\nPersonal Conduct\nThe Concern: Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of\ncandor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations \ncan \nraise \nquestions \nabout \nan \nindividual\u2019s \nreliability, \nreliability,\ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified and sensitive information.\nOf special interest is any failure to cooperate or provide truthful and\ncandid answers during national security investigative or adjudicative\nprocesses. . . .\u201d AG \u00b6 15.\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the principles and policies framed by the AGs, a decision to grant\nor continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon a threshold\nfinding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because the\nDirective requires administrative judges to make a commonsense appraisal of the\nevidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's\neligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and\nmateriality of that evidence. See United States, v. Gaudin, 515 U.S. 506, 509-511\n(1995).  As with all adversarial proceedings, the judge may draw only those inferences\nwhich have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record. \nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) it must prove by substantial\nevidence any controverted facts alleged in the SOR, and (2) it must demonstrate that\nthe facts proven have a material bearing to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or\nmaintain a security clearance. The required materiality showing, however, does not\nrequire the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually\nmishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security\nclearance. Rather, the judge must consider and weigh the cognizable risks that an\napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted\nor controverted facts, the evidentiary burden shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation,\nor mitigation.  Based on the requirement of  Exec. Or. 10865 that all security\nclearances be clearly consistent with the national interest, the applicant has the\nultimate burden of demonstrating his or her clearance eligibility. \u201c[S]ecurity-clearance\ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d See Department of the\nNavy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nAnalysis  \nApplicant presents with a history of alcohol-related incidents (four in all) spaced \nover a period of 32 years. Between August 1984 and January 2016, Applicant pled\nguilty to four separate alcohol-related incidents ranging from open container to DUI\noffenses. Principal security issues raised in this case center on Applicant\u2019s alcohol-\nrelated offenses covered by Guideline G and incorporated under Guideline E.\n7\n\nAdditional security concerns are raised over his administrative separation that resulted\nfrom his testing positive for cocaine use in November 2004. \nAlcohol consumption concerns\nApplicant\u2019s problems with recurrent alcohol-related incidents over a 32-year\nperiod raise concerns over his risk of future alcohol abuse. On the strength of the\nevidence presented, two disqualifying conditions (DCs) of the AGs for alcohol\nconsumption (AG \u00b6 21) may be applied: DC \u00b6\u00b6 22(a), \u201calcohol-related incidents away\nfrom work, such as driving while under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse,\ndisturbing the peace or other incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the\nindividual\u2019s alcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol\nabuse disorder,\u201d and 22(c), \u201chabitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of\nimpaired judgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol use\ndisorder.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s completion of a self-referred alcohol counseling program in 2017\nfollowed his last open container conviction in March 2016. Still, Applicant felt enough\nconcern about his slip in January 2016 to self-refer himself to an outpatient counseling\nprogram. After continuing his pre-January 2016 pattern of occasional drinking for the\nensuing 14 months, he made the decision to cease drinking altogether in September\n2017, and with the support of AA and continued alcohol counseling, he  has maintained\nhis abstinence from alcohol since March 2017. \nBased on the findings of the court considering his March 2016 incident and the\nsustained progress he has demonstrated in avoiding abusing drinking since March\n2016, with sustained abstinence since March 2017, he may take full advantage of the\nfollowing Guideline G mitigating conditions: MC \u00b6\u00b6 23(a), \u201cso much time has passed, or\nthe behavior was so infrequent, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that\nit is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or judgment,\u201d and 32(d) \u201cthe individual has successfully completed a\ntreatment program along with required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and\nestablished pattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with\ntreatment recommendations.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s circumstances and subsequent proactive steps he has taken since\nhis last alcohol-related incident in 2016 are sufficient to facilitate safe predictions that\nhe will avoid any abusive drinking in the foreseeable future. Each of these cited\noffenses are cross-referenced under Guideline E and are considered to be alcohol-\nrelated for purposes of Guideline E analysis. \nPersonal conduct concerns\nAdditional security concerns not expressly covered by Guideline G, are raised\nunder Guideline E, and require separate addressing. Applicant\u2019s administrative\nseparation from the Army in May 2005 following a long and distinguished military career\nwith the Army was precipitated by his testing positive for cocaine in November 2004\nand later receiving NJP based on his command\u2019s finding of misconduct. Disqualifying\n8\n\nconditions covered by personal conduct that are applicable to Applicant\u2019s testing\npositive for cocaine are twofold: DC \u00b6\u00b6 16(d), \u201ccredible adverse information that is not\nexplicitly covered under any other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an\nadverse determination, but which, when combined with all available information,\nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness,\nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other\ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard classified or\nsensitive information. This includes, but is not limited to, consideration of \u201c . . . (3) a\npattern of dishonesty or rule violations . . . .\u201d\nMitigation is available to Applicant. Applicable mitigating conditions under\nGuideline E covering Applicant\u2019s 2005 administrative separation from the Army based\non his prior testing positive for cocaine and receiving NJP are as follows:  MC \u00b6\u00b6 17(c),\n\u201cthe offense is so minor or, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so\ninfrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment,\u201d and 17(d), \u201c\u201dthe individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained\ncounseling to change the behavior or taken positive steps to alleviate the stressors,\ncircumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, unreliable, or other\ninappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur,\u201d apply to Applicant\u2019s\nsituation. Passage of time since his isolated positive drug test in November 2004\nexceeds 14 years and provides enough time to mitigate this drug-related offense under\nGuideline E.\nWhole-person assessment\nApplicant\u2019s lengthy civilian service with DoD (over 14 years) is respected and\nappreciated. Endorsements from his current and former supervisors, coworkers, and\nfriends who know and have worked with him document his strong character, trust, and\nreliability. \nApplicant\u2019s credits include strong performance evaluations and documented\nclearances and certifications of course completions in unit level logistics, leadership\ndevelopment, and combat lifesaving.

Applicant presented sufficient evidence to mitigate the \nsecurity concern about his sexual behavior and his personal conduct. Accordingly, this \ncase is decided for Applicant.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn March 14, 2017, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) to obtain a security clearance for a position with a \ndefense contractor. On September 14, 2017, the Department of Defense (DOD) \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) sent Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \nalleging that his circumstances raised security concerns under the sexual behavior \nguideline and the personal conduct guideline. Applicant answered the SOR on October \n27, 2017, and requested a hearing to establish his eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.1 \n1 This action was taken under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended, as well as Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive). In \n01/30/2019\n\n2 \n \n \n \n \nOn July 19, 2018, a date mutually agreed to by the parties, a hearing was held. \nApplicant testified and called three character witnesses to testify on his behalf. Applicant \noffered three exhibits, Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through C, which were admitted without \nobjection. The exhibits offered by the Government were admitted without objection. \n(Government Exhibits (GE) 1 \u2013 3.) Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR attached seven \ndocuments, which I have marked as Answer Exhibits (Answer Ex) A through G. Six of \nthose are character reference letters. Answer Ex B through G. The transcript of the \nhearing (Tr.) was received on July 27, 2018.2  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is 59 years old, a college graduate, who has a professional engineering \ndegree and is a certified project management professional. He is married (since 1994) \nand has a son age 13.3 \n \nApplicant started his own mechanical contracting company in 1993. He now owns \nfour separate companies, one of which is a secured facility, for which Applicant is a key \nmanagement person. His companies provide engineering, consulting, and project \nmanagement services for construction projects, particularly specializing in the \nconstruction of computer rooms. Over the years, Applicant\u2019s companies have worked for \nnumerous federal government agencies. On those projects, his companies have received \na number of \u201cexceptional\u201d ratings, and always \u201cvery good\u201d or higher.4   \n \nUnder Guideline D, the SOR alleges that Applicant engaged in prostitution from \nabout the early 1990s through at least 2014. Applicant admitted that allegation, with \nexplanations.5 Under Guideline E, the SOR alleges that during an October 31, 2014 \npolygraph examination, Applicant deliberately omitted that he had an extramarital affair \nwith a female co-worker in 2007. The SOR also alleges that in his March 14, 2017 security \nclearance application, in explaining his clearance revocation by the Another Government \nAgency (AGA) in April 2016, he disclosed his activity with prostitution in foreign countries \nwhere such conduct was legal but deliberately omitted his conduct in one of the United \n                                                          \naddition, the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (AG), \neffective within the Defense Department on June 8, 2017, apply here.    \n \n2 Applicant\u2019s counsel originally objected to GE 3, a report of three polygraphs of Applicant administered by \nthe National Security Agency. Tr. 10. Counsel for Applicant later withdrew his objection, and GE 3 was \nadmitted into evidence. Tr. 67-68.   \n \n3 GE 1; GE 2; Tr. 32.  \n \n4 Tr. 33-37.  \n \n5 SOR \u00b6 1.a; Answer, pp. 1-3. The SOR\u2019s diction is inaccurate. Applicant did not \u201cengage in prostitution.\u201d \nRather, he solicited or paid for sexual services offered by women. The women are the ones who \u201cengaged \nin prostitution.\u201d Nevertheless, in this Decision, the use of the phrases \u201cengage in prostitution\u201d or \u201cengaged \nin prostitution\u201d refers to Applicant\u2019s conduct that is the subject of SOR \u00b6 1.a.  \n  \n\n3 \n \nStates in which prostitution was illegal. Applicant denied that his omissions were \ndeliberate.6  \n \nApplicant testified about the frequency with which he engaged the services of \nprostitutes in the past. He testified about those instances when he was in foreign countries \nwhere he believed prostitution to be legal: once in 1998, between 2000 and 2010 (never), \nfrom 2011 to 2014 about 11 times. He identified one instance in 2010 or 2011 when he \nhired a prostitute in the United States. Applicant knew that was illegal but he called it a \n\u201clapse in judgment\u201d and did not consider it a \u201cmajor crime.\u201d The last time he hired a \nprostitute was in August 2014. The occasions were social trips or conferences with \nbusiness associates.7 \n \nApplicant testified that his engagements with prostitutes in those countries where \nprostitution was legal, was not unsafe, was discreet, personal, and anonymous; he never \ncarried his work or personal identification cards. He had only minimal concerns about to \nwhom those prostitutes might be connected.8 \n \n  \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant discussed a medical condition that his wife \nhas had since he first met her, that is, a life-long glandular disorder that requires daily \nmedications. One of the side effects is that his wife has no sex drive, and their sexual \nrelations have been limited to once every two or three years. She is very loving and caring \nbut has no interest in sex. Applicant and his wife have tried to resolve the issue with \ncounseling, but the results have been limited and short-lived.9 \n \n \nApplicant elaborated on that issue in his testimony. His wife\u2019s medical condition \ncreates a problem with her sex drive. There is much intimacy between them but no sex. \nThe longest lapse of sex with his wife has been about three years. In about 2010, his \nwife\u2019s condition worsened, and her doctors tried to adjust her medications. That was \nunsuccessful, and surgery was required. At the time, Applicant and his wife were in joint \nand individual counseling. They continued that until 2011, when Applicant was assigned \nto a project in another state. He was unable to keep their counseling appointments. Since \nthe SOR, he and his wife have been attending counseling. Applicant believes their \n                                                          \n6 SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a -2.b; Answer, pp. 3-4. The AGA administered three polygraphs to Applicant, in October 2014, \nMarch 2015, and April 2015. Those polygraphs revealed that sometime in the 1990s and from 2000 (or \n2001) until 2014, Applicant hired prostitutes in foreign countries where he believed prostitution was legal, \nexcept for one occasion when he hired a prostitute in one state in America where it was illegal. As a result, \nApplicant\u2019s Sensitive Compartmented Information clearance was revoked effective July 28, 2016. GE 3. \nExcept for pointing out that prostitution was illegal in that one American state, the Government has not \ncontended that prostitution was illegal in the foreign countries where Applicant engaged prostitutes.  \n \n7 Tr. 38-40, 71-72. \n \n8 Tr. 75-76, 79, 93. Applicant\u2019s wife does not know about today\u2019s hearing. Tr. 83.  \n  \n9 Answer, p. 2.  \n \n\n4 \n \nrelationship is now very strong, as strong as it has ever been. The counseling has had a \npositive effect, and they plan to continue it indefinitely.10  \n \nApplicant testified that he has never told his wife about his history of using \nprostitutes, because it would hurt her feelings. Applicant is not sure his wife would leave \nhim, but he could not be blackmailed. Applicant has not told his son, because he is 13 \nand would not understand. Applicant has not told his parents or his three siblings, but he \nis not be afraid to do so. He said they would probably be surprised, but it would not \njeopardize his relationships with them. Applicant would not be afraid to inform anyone if \n\u201cpush came to shove.\u201d There are probably eight to ten friends and professional \nassociates, including his FSO, whom he has told about his history of using prostitutes. \nApplicant expressed remorse, because it was \u201cselfish and senseless.\u201d Applicant testified \nthat he will never engage in prostitution again.11 \n \nApplicant addressed the SOR allegation that during his October 31, 2014 \npolygraph he deliberately omitted that he had an extramarital affair with a female co-\nworker in 2007. He testified that the affair was in 2007 to 2008, lasted about six months, \nand that his wife found out about the affair in that time frame. As a result, Applicant and \nhis wife underwent joint and individual counseling. Since his wife knows about the affair, \nApplicant contends that he could not be blackmailed.12 Applicant also explained that he \ndid not disclose this affair, because the focus of the October 31, 2014 polygraph was on \nhis activities with prostitutes. He was trying to make sure he listed all the instances of \nprostitution. In the post-test interview after his March 3, 2015 polygraph, it appears that \nApplicant volunteered the information about his affair and the reasons he did not disclose \nit during the October 2014 polygraph. Applicant testified that he was never asked directly \nor indirectly about any affairs in that first polygraph. He denies that he deliberately omitted \nthe information about his one affair.13 \n \nApplicant addressed the SOR allegation that on his March 14, 2017 security \nclearance application he deliberately omitted that he engaged in prostitution in a state \nwhere it was illegal. The SOR selectively quotes Applicant\u2019s response to Section 25-\nInvestigations and Clearance Record. A more complete response is as follows:  \n \nIn 2014 I applied for a TS-SCI with full scope polygraph. During my \ninitial polygraph I disclosed my activity with prostitution on several \noccasions in foreign locations where the activity was not a criminal offense. \nI learned at that time that the US Government treats all prostitution as a \nserious crime (emphasis added).  \n \n                                                          \n10 Tr. 44-47, 81-83.  \n \n11 Tr. 47-51, 96.  \n \n12 Tr. 49, 52-53, 84, 89, 93-95. \n  \n13 Tr. 56, 58-59; GE 3; Answer, p. 3.  \n \n\n5 \n \nThe italicized portion was not quoted in the SOR. In the October 31, 2014 \npolygraph, Applicant expressly listed his engagement of a prostitute in a state in America \nwhere he knew it was illegal. Applicant testified that having made that disclosure to AGA \nin 2014, he believed that the disclosure was part of his clearance record. He claimed that \nhe did not intentionally omit that information.14 \n \nApplicant submitted a January 11, 2018 Summary Report of Psychological \nEvaluation by a licensed psychologist. The psychologist has been licensed to practice \nsince 1985 and has his doctorate in Clinical Psychology from a prestigious university. The \ndates of the evaluation were in October and November 2017 and in January 2018. The \nconclusions were that Applicant is a \u201cfundamentally sound individual who appears to be \nfree from any major psychological diagnosis or difficulties.\u201d It found further that: \u201cHis \ntesting indicates that he does not have any major psychological problems and that he \ndoes not warrant a psychological diagnosis.\u201d The report concludes: \u201cThere is no indication \nthat this illicit behavior will reoccur, and he appears to be fully capable of holding a position \nof trust as he has successfully done for many years prior.\u201d15 \n \nApplicant called three character witnesses. Each witness had known Applicant \nprofessionally and personally for ten years or more. They were aware of the SOR\u2019s \nallegations. \nEach \nwitness \nattested \nto \nApplicant\u2019s \nreliability, \nhonesty, \nand \ntrustworthiness.16 Three other individuals who did not testify submitted character \nreference letters which also praised those qualities.17  \n   \nLaw and Policies \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). Individuals are eligible for access to classified information \n\u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest\u201d to authorize \nsuch access. E.O. 10865 \u00a7 2; SEAD-4, \u00b6 E.4. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance, an administrative \njudge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions. The \nguidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human \nbehavior, an administrative judge applies the guidelines in a  commonsense manner, \nconsidering all available and reliable information, in arriving at a fair and impartial \ndecision. SEAD-4, Appendix A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(c), 2(d). \n \n                                                          \n14 Tr. 58-62.  \n \n15 AE B.  \n \n16 Tr. 23-30, 102-04, 110-13. Those witnesses also submitted character reference letters. Answer Ex C, D, \nand F. \n \n17 Answer Ex B, E, and G.  \n\n6 \n \nDepartment Counsel must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged \nin the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. Applicants are responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and \nother evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or \nproven . . . and has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable \nclearance decision.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  \n \nAdministrative Judges are responsible for ensuring that an applicant receives fair \nnotice of the issues raised, has a reasonable opportunity to litigate those issues, and is \nnot subjected to unfair surprise. ISCR Case No. 12-01266 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 4, 2014). \nIn resolving the ultimate question regarding an applicant\u2019s eligibility, \u201c[a]ny doubt \nconcerning personnel being considered for national security eligibility will be resolved in \nfavor of the national security.\u201d SEAD-4, Appendix A, \u00b6 2(b). See also SEAD-4, \u00b6 E.4. \nMoreover, the Supreme Court has held that officials making \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours. The Government reposes a high degree of trust and \nconfidence in individuals to whom it grants access to classified information. Decisions \ninclude, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or \ninadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain \ndegree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of \ncompromise of classified information. \n \nDiscussion \n \nGuideline D, Sexual Behavior \n \n \nThe SOR alleges that from about the early 1990s through at least 2014 Applicant \nengaged in prostitution (SOR \u00b6 1.a). The concern under this guideline is set out in AG 12:  \n \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of judgment \nor discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence of coercion, \nexploitation, or duress. These issues, together or individually, may raise \nquestions about an individual's judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Sexual behavior \nincludes conduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, electronic, or \nwritten transmission. . . .   \n \nThe following potentially disqualifying conditions are relevant:  \n \nAG \u00b6 13(a): sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the \nindividual has been prosecuted;  \n \nAG \u00b6 13(b): a pattern of compulsive, self-destructive, or high-risk sexual \nbehavior that the individual is unable to stop;  \n\n7 \n \n \nAG \u00b6 13(c): sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and \n \nAG \u00b6 13(d): sexual behavior of a public nature or that reflects lack of \ndiscretion or judgment. \n \n \nBy his own estimates, Applicant has used prostitutes 13 times since 1998. On one \noccasion he hired a prostitute in a state where doing so was illegal. AG \u00b6\u00b6 13(a), 13(c), \nand 13(d) are established.   \n \n \nAG \u00b6 13(b) is not fully established. Applicant engaged in high-risk sexual behavior  \nover the span of 16 years. But after his first episode in 1998, he did not engage in \nprostitution until 2010. Moreover, the psychologist\u2019s report and Applicant\u2019s abstinence \nsince August 2014 tend to negate the element of this disqualifying condition that he is \nunable to stop his behavior. The next inquiry is whether any mitigating conditions apply.  \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable:  \n \nAG \u00b6 14(b): the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or \nunder such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 14(c): the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and \n \nAG \u00b6 14(e): the individual has successfully completed an appropriate \nprogram of treatment, or is currently enrolled in one, has demonstrated \nongoing and consistent compliance with the treatment plan, and/or has \nreceived a favorable prognosis from a qualified mental health professional \nindicating the behavior is readily controllable with treatment. \n \n \nApplicant last engaged in prostitution in August 2014, more than four years ago. It \nappears that Applicant has informed his closest personal and professional friends of his \nhistory of using prostitutes. He has told them of his intention never to engage prostitutes \nagain. Applicant\u2019s psychologist is convinced that this conduct will not recur. Applicant \ntestified credibly that he would not be blackmailed if his parents or siblings learned of that \nhistory. Applicant testified plausibly about why he believed it was unnecessary to disclose \nhis history to his spouse or son. Applicant also testified credibly about his remorse for his \npast conduct and that he and his spouse are committed to continue marital counseling \nindefinitely. I find that AG \u00b6\u00b614(b), (c), and (e) apply.  \n \n \n \n \n\n8 \n \n \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct  \n \nIn assessing an allegation of deliberate falsification, I consider not only the \nallegation and Applicant\u2019s answer but all relevant circumstances. Under Guideline E for \npersonal conduct, the concern is that \u201c[c]onduct involving questionable judgment, lack of \ncandor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified \nor sensitive information.\u201d18 A statement is false or dishonest when it is made deliberately \n(knowingly and willfully). An omission of relevant and material information is not deliberate \nif, for example, the person genuinely forgot about it, inadvertently overlooked it, \nmisunderstood the question, reasonably did not know the information, or genuinely \nthought the information did not need to be reported. \n \nThe SOR alleged that during his October 31, 2014 polygraph examination \nApplicant deliberately omitted that he had an extramarital affair with a female co-worker \nin 2007. Applicant denied that allegation. Applicant testified credibly that during that \npolygraph he was never asked directly or indirectly about any affairs. He also testified \nthat the focus of the questioning was his history of hiring prostitutes, about which he was \ntrying to give as complete a response as possible. I find that Applicant reasonably \nbelieved that he need not disclose that affair.  \n \nThe SOR also alleged that on his March 14, 2017 security questionnaire he \ndeliberately omitted that he hired a prostitute in a state where that was illegal. Applicant \ndenied that allegation. Applicant testified credibly that he disclosed that incident during \nhis October 31, 2014 polygraph and believed it did not need to be disclosed in that \nquestionnaire because it was already part of his clearance record. I find that Applicant \nreasonably believed that he need not disclose that incident again.  \n \n The record does not raise doubts about Applicant\u2019s current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect classified information. In reaching \nthis conclusion, I weighed the evidence as a whole and considered if the favorable \nevidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence or vice versa. I also gave due \nconsideration to the whole-person concept.19 Accordingly, I conclude that Applicant met \nhis ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n                                                          \n18 AG \u00b6 15.   \n \n19 AG \u00b6 2(a)(1)-(9).

Applicant married in September 1983 \nand divorced in 1992.

In his Answer to \nthe SOR on October 23, 2017, Applicant admitted the allegation of failure to timely file \nincome tax returns at SOR \u00b6 1.a. He also admitted the alleged delinquent debts placed \nfor collection in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b -1.d, and the charged-off debt for $1,400 at SOR \u00b6 1.e. \nApplicant claims that he learned he was overdue on filing his federal income tax returns \nduring his personal security interview (PSI) in August 2016.3 He stated his intention to \nresolve the matter as soon as possible.  \n \nAttached to his October 2017 Answer to the SOR, were two checks made out to \nthe U.S. Treasury on Applicant\u2019s account in the amounts of $3,324 and $1,928. Both \nchecks were dated July 7, 2017. Presumably, this was for back taxes owed, plus \npenalties and fees to the IRS, because Applicant stated his intent to file all overdue \nreturns and resolve all tax issues with the IRS no later than June 30, 2017.4 He \nprovided no explanation why he was unable to file his federal income tax returns timely \nin the first place. He produced no documentary evidence to show that he followed \nthrough and actually filed the tax returns or entered into any repayment arrangement \nwith the IRS except for the two checks.  \n \nThe single debt in the amount of $605 alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b was for a utility \naccount that was opened in December 2011 and the last activity was in March 2015 on \nthis account.5 Applicant claims to have paid it off in his answer but he provided no \nsubstantiation.

Yet, he provided no documentation to confirm payments. The debt for $470 \nplaced for collection by a bank at SOR \u00b61.c, was for a credit card account. Applicant\u2019s \nFebruary 2016 credit bureau report reflects that it was opened in December 2014, and \nthe last activity on the account was in January 2016. (Item 6) It remains delinquent.  \n \n \nApplicant provided no response to the FORM or evidence that he received \nfinancial counseling. He provided no budget showing income against expenses, or other \ndocumentation to show progress on his delinquent debts. He professed his intentions to \nfile his overdue income tax returns and repay his delinquent debts in his SCA in January \n2016, and in his PSI in August 2016. He produced no documentary evidence that he \nhas done so.    \n \n \n \n                                            Policies \n \n \nThis action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the Administrative Guidelines (AGs) promulgated in \nSecurity Executive Agent Directive 4 (SEAD 4), effective within the DOD on June 8, \n2017.  \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \neligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines recognize the complexities of human behavior, and are applied \nin conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(a), the adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period \nand a careful weighing of a number of variables of an individual\u2019s life to make an \naffirmative determination that the individual is an acceptable security risk. This is known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \n\n \n4 \n \n \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. Decisions \ninclude, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk that an applicant may \ndeliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such decisions \nentail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than \nactual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  Analysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b618:  \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance abuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following \napply here:  \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;   \n \n           (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual federal, state, or local income \n            tax returns or failure to pay annual federal, state, or local income tax as  \n            required.   \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s failure to timely file TY 2011-2014 federal income tax returns and the \ndelinquent debts alleged in the SOR are confirmed by his credit reports and answer to \nthe SOR. The Government produced substantial evidence to support the disqualifying \nconditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(b), 19(c), and 19(f), thereby shifting the burden to Applicant to \nproduce evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.6 Applicant has not \nmet that burden.   \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are \npotentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control . . . , and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances;     \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements.   \n \n \nApplicant endured a one-year period of unemployment in 2015, and a downturn \nin the economy. He has been assigned overseas for extensive periods of time during \nthe last decade. Arguably, these conditions were beyond his control. Yet, despite his \nknowledge over a year ago that his delinquency might affect his eligibility for a security \nclearance when he completed his SCA, and then reinforcing his intention to make \npayment arrangements in his PSI, he has done very little to resolve these delinquent \naccounts. He has produced no relevant or responsive documentation either with his \nAnswer to the SOR, or in response to the FORM, except for the two payments to the \nU.S. Treasury Department. He has not demonstrated that he acted responsibly under \nthe circumstances. Applicant has the burden to provide sufficient evidence to show that \nhis financial problems are under control, and that his debts were incurred under \ncircumstances making them unlikely to recur.  \n                                                          \n6 Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep 22, 2005) (An applicant has the \nburden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government). \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions fully apply. He admitted his failures to timely file \nthe federal income tax returns for three years (2011-2014) and Applicant\u2019s credit report \nand SOR list the delinquent utility and consumer debts totaling $3,411. Applicant did not \nprovide enough details with documentary corroboration about what he did to address \nhis SOR debts. He did not provide documentation relating to any of the SOR debts: (1) \nproof of payments, such as checking account statements, photocopies of checks, or a \nletter from the creditor proving that he paid or made any payments to the creditors; (2) \ncorrespondence to or from the creditors to establish maintenance of contact;7 (3) \ncredible debt disputes indicating he did not believe he was responsible for the debts and \nwhy he held such a belief; (4) more evidence of attempts to negotiate payment plans, \nsuch as settlement offers or agreements to show that he was attempting to resolve \nthese debts; or (5) other evidence of progress or resolution. \n \n \nIn the FORM, Department Counsel informed Applicant that it was important for \nhim to provide corroborating or supporting documentation of resolution of the debt in the \nSOR. (FORM at 3) Aside from Applicant\u2019s uncorroborated statements, there is no \ndocumentary evidence that Applicant paid, arranged to pay, settled, compromised, or \notherwise resolved the SOR debts. He did not describe financial counseling or provide \nhis budget. The record lacks corroborating or substantiating documentation and detailed \nexplanations of the causes for his financial problems and other mitigating information.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n                                                          \n7 \u201cEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside \nhis [or his] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable \nmanner when dealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. \n12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is \nwhether he or she maintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep \ndebts current.  \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines. Notably, Applicant retired with a pension after a \ncareer in the Army, and he has derived his income primarily from taxpayer-funded \nfederal contractors for over a decade. Yet, he has not explained his failure to timely file \nfederal income tax returns. He has gone through unemployment and an unexpected \nloss of household income, but he has been employed most of his adult life, with the \nexception of a one-year period of unemployment in 2015. Most importantly, Applicant \nhas not addressed the specific allegations in the SOR. Instead, he has made hollow \npromises of his intent to file the tax returns and to repay his delinquent debts. He has \nnot met his burden of production.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s finances remain a security concern. There is insufficient evidence to \nconclude that Applicant\u2019s financial problems are under control. He has not met his \nburden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves me with serious questions and \ndoubts as to Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising under Guideline F, \nfinancial considerations.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n Subparagraph 1.a \u2013 1.e:               \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Conclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant a security \nclearance.

With no objection, the SOR was amended to read as follows: (1) SOR \u00b6 1.b \nalleges, \u201cYou possess two foreign bank accounts with balances totaling approximately \n$2,000\u201d; (2) SOR \u00b6 1.c alleges, \u201cYour husband owns property in India worth in excess of \n$50,000 U.S.\u201d; and (3) SOR \u00b6 1.d was added and alleges, \u201cYour husband has a bank \naccount in India with a balance totaling approximately $28,000.\u201d1 \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s request that I take administrative notice of certain facts \nabout India was included in the record as HE I. Applicant did not object, and requested \nthat I also take administrative notice of certain facts about India, as set forth in HE IV. I \nhave taken administrative notice of the facts contained in HE I and IV. The facts \nadministratively noticed are summarized in the Findings of Fact, below.   \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. She is 42 years old. She obtained \na bachelor\u2019s degree from a university in India in 1994. She is married. She has two \nchildren; both are native-born U.S. citizens.2 \n \n \nApplicant has worked as a tester of health applications for her current employer \nsince October 2016. Within six months, she was promoted to a team lead position in \nwhich she has managed a six to eight-person team. She was first granted eligibility to \nhold a public trust position in December 2016, and she is seeking to maintain her \neligibility for access to sensitive information.3 \n \nApplicant was born in India. She immigrated to the United States in 2001, to join \nher husband. She was naturalized as a U.S. citizen and obtained a U.S. passport in \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 7-11. \n \n2 Tr. at 6-11, 41, 69, 71-73, 91-94, 99-100; GE 1. \n \n3 Tr. at 22-80; GE 1; AE K. \n\n \n3 \n2009. Her husband was also born in India. He immigrated to the United States in 1998, \nand he also became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2009. Both Applicant and her husband \nconsider themselves solely U.S. citizens.4   \n \nApplicant\u2019s father, six sisters, brother, mother-in-law, and father-in-law are \ncitizens and residents of India (SOR \u00b6 1.a). Her mother died in 1995. She testified that \nnone of her family members in India have ever had ties to the Indian government or \nmilitary. She travels to India once every two years to visit her family there, and she did \nso in 2010, 2012, 2014, 2017, and 2018. She testified that she has reported all of her \nforeign travels to her security officer, as required. She and her husband indicated that \nnone of her foreign family members are aware that she has a public trust position, and \nare only generally aware that she works in the information technology field as a \nsoftware tester.5 \n \nApplicant\u2019s father is 80 years old. He was formerly self-employed. He owns \nfarming land in India worth approximately $70,000 USD. Applicant testified that her \nbrother would inherit her father\u2019s land when her father passes away. She maintains \nbiweekly to monthly telephone contact with her father, and she gives him $150 once \nyearly.6 \n \nApplicant\u2019s six sisters are ages 61, 58, 56, 54, 52, and 50. They are all \nhomemakers. Their husbands work for private companies--one runs a publication \nbusiness, another runs a product supply business, one works in education, one works in \na private bank, one works as an accountant, and one is retired from a private \nnewspaper. Applicant maintains biweekly to monthly contact with her sisters. Applicant\u2019s \nbrother is 46 years old and works for a private company. He lives with their father. \nApplicant maintains monthly contact with her brother, and she gives him approximately \n$100 to $200 once every two years.7  \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law and father-in-law are approximately 70 and 74 years \nold, respectively. They are both retired from the same private company, where \nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law was a typist and her father-in-law was a clerk. They do not \nreceive a pension. Applicant maintains bimonthly telephonic contact with them, and her \nhusband talks to his parents once biweekly to monthly. Applicant\u2019s husband travels to \nIndia to visit his parents once every three to five years, and he last did so in 2017. \nApplicant and her husband occasionally provide them with financial support, as further \ndiscussed below.8 \n \n                                                          \n4 Tr. at 22-80, 91-94; AE C. \n \n5 Tr. at 22-80, 91-116; GE 1. \n \n6 Tr. at 22-80, 91-116; GE 1. \n \n7 Tr. at 22-80, 91-116; GE 1. \n \n8 Tr. at 22-80, 91-116; GE 1. \n\n \n4 \nApplicant and her husband have financial interests in India totaling approximately \n$75,000. She has two bank accounts in India that she uses to pay for her expenses \nwhen she travels there. The combined balance on both accounts was $2,000 USD at \nthe time of her October 2017 security clearance application (SCA), and it was $1,020 \nUSD as of the date of the hearing. Her husband has a bank account in India that his \nparents use to pay for their medical and daily living expenses. He also uses it to pay for \nhis expenses when he travels to India. Its balance at the time of her SCA was $28,000 \nUSD, and it was $24,000 USD as of the date of the hearing. Applicant\u2019s husband \nintends to close his bank account in India when he no longer needs it to pay for his \nparents\u2019 expenses. He also owns one property in India. He purchased it for \napproximately $12,000 USD in 1999, before he and Applicant were married, for his \nparents to live. Its value as of the date of the hearing was $50,000 USD. Applicant and \nher husband intend to sell this property when his parents no longer need to live in it, and \ninvest the money from the sale in the United States.9 \n \nApplicant testified that neither she nor her husband intend to return to India in the \nfuture to live, as their life is in the United States. She also testified that they are loyal to \nthe United States. Their assets in the United States total approximately $1.9 million. \nThis includes their two homes--their primary residence and rental property that they \npurchased in 2017 and 2014, respectively; their combined annual income of $200,000; \nand their retirement and investment accounts.10  \n \nApplicant has not had any unfavorable issues at work, and she has completed all \nrequisite annual training. She testified that she would report any attempts to blackmail \nher or her family in India to the proper authorities. Prior to holding her current public \ntrust position, she was a homemaker from 2001 through 2009. She then worked in the \npublic school system for several years from 2009 to 2016. She is involved in her \ncommunity, to include serving as her children\u2019s Girl Scouts treasurer.11 \n \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor and project manager since 2016 described Applicant as a \ngood worker. Her coworker since November 2016 testified that Applicant is an \nexceptional team lead, a driven and detail-oriented worker, and an honest and likeable \nindividual. A former coworker from the public school system, and a friend of Applicant of \nten years, described Applicant as possessing a strong work ethic and an individual who \nis loyal to the United States. Individuals who know Applicant from Girl Scouts described \nher as an honest person.12  \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n9 Tr. at 22-80, 91-116; GE 1; AE A, B, D, E. \n \n10 Tr. at 6-11, 22-80, 91-116; AE F, G. \n  \n11 Tr. at 22-91, 116-125; GE 1; AE H, I, J. \n \n12 Tr. at 22-91, 116-125; GE 1; AE H, J. \n\n \n5 \nIndia  \n \n \nIndia and seven other countries were identified, in a 2008 Annual Report to \nCongress on Foreign Economic Collection and Industrial Espionage, as being involved \nin economic and industrial espionage. In its 2009 to 2011 Report to Congress, the \nOffice of the National Counterintelligence Executive reported that sensitive U.S. \neconomic information and technology are targeted by the intelligence services, private \nsector, and citizens of dozens of countries, to include U.S. allies and its partners. The \nU.S. Department of Justice identified numerous criminal cases concerning export \nenforcement related to proprietary defense information, economic espionage, theft of \ntrade secrets, and embargo-related criminal prosecutions involving both the Indian \ngovernment as well as private companies and individuals in India. \n \n \nAnti-Western terrorist groups, including some on the U.S. Government\u2019s list of \nforeign terrorist organizations, are active in India, and the DOS warns U.S. citizens that \nIndia continues to experience terrorist and insurgent activities that may affect U.S. \ncitizens directly or indirectly. The South Asian Terrorism Portal, run by the nonprofit \nInstitute for Conflict Management, reported fatalities during the first half of 2017 due to \nterrorism and insurgency in India.  \n \n \nIndia continues to experience significant human rights abuses. In its 2018 \nannual human rights report for India, the DOS identified the following as India\u2019s most \nsignificant human rights problems: police and security force abuses; widespread \ncorruption; reports of political prisoners in certain states; instances of censorship and \nharassment of media outlets including some critical of the government; and a lack of \naccountability for misconduct at all levels of government, contributing to widespread \nimpunity.  \n \n \nThe Central Monitoring System (CMS) in India, a mass electronic surveillance \ndata-mining program installed by a government-owned center, continued to allow \ngovernmental agencies to monitor electronic communication in real time without \ninforming the subject or a judge.  The CMS also provides agencies with centralized \naccess to the telecommunications network, the ability to hear and record mobile, \nlandline, satellite, and Voice over Internet Protocol phone calls, read private e-mails \nand text messages, and track geographical locations of people in real time. \n \nPolicies \n \nThe Under Secretary of Defense\u2019s Memorandum of November 19, 2004, treats \nADP positions as sensitive positions, and it entitles applicants for ADP positions to the \nprocedural protections in the Directive before any final unfavorable access \ndetermination may be made. The standard set out in the adjudicative guidelines for \nassignment to sensitive duties is that the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness \nare such that assigning the person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security. AG \u00b6 2.b.   \n \n\n \n6 \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. \nDecisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant may \ndeliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive information.  \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the \nwhole person. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial and commonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable.  \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. Under AG \n\u00b6 2(b), \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to [sensitive] \ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d The Government must present \nsubstantial evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.14. Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). An applicant has the ultimate burden of \ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with national security to grant or continue \neligibility for access to sensitive information.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \nThe trustworthiness concern for foreign influence is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a trustworthiness concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a trustworthiness concern if \nthey create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns   \nunder AG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n\n \n7 \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; \n \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(f) substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign country, \nor in any foreign owned or foreign-operated business that could subject \nthe individual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation or \npersonal conflict of interest. \n \nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States. \u201cThe \nUnited States has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding sensitive \ninformation from any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have \naccess to it, regardless of whether that person, organization, or country has \ninterests inimical to those of the United States.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. \nBd. May 19, 2004). \n \nFurthermore, \u201ceven friendly nations can have profound disagreements with \nthe United States over matters they view as important to their vital interests or \nnational security.\u201d ISCR Case No. 00-0317, 2002 DOHA LEXIS 83 at **15-16 (App. \nBd. Mar. 29, 2002). Finally, we know friendly nations have engaged in espionage \nagainst the United States, especially in the economic, scientific, and technical \nfields. Nevertheless, the nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the \nUnited States, and its human rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that \nan applicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable to government coercion. The risk of \ncoercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an \nauthoritarian government, a family member is associated with or dependent upon the \ngovernment, or the country is known to conduct intelligence operations against the \nUnited States. In considering the nature of the government, an administrative judge \nmust also consider any terrorist activity in the country at issue. See generally ISCR \nCase No. 02-26130 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 7, 2006) (reversing decision to grant \nclearance where administrative judge did not consider terrorist activity in area where \nfamily members resided). \n \nAG \u00b6 7(a) requires substantial evidence of a \u201cheightened risk.\u201d The \n\u201cheightened risk\u201d required to raise one of these disqualifying conditions is a relatively \nlow standard. \u201cHeightened risk\u201d denotes a risk greater than the normal risk inherent in \n\n \n8 \nhaving a family member living under a foreign government. Applicant\u2019s family \nmembers are citizens and residents of India. India was identified as involved in \neconomic and industrial espionage. In addition, terrorist activities, significant human \nrights abuses, and government monitoring of communications and geographical \nlocations of people are present in India. Applicant\u2019s foreign contacts create a \npotential conflict of interest and a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, and coercion, both directly as well as through \nher husband and their financial interests in India. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(b), 7(e), and 7(f) \nhave been raised by the evidence. \n \nConditions that could mitigate foreign influence trustworthiness concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 8. The following are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; and \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n \nAG \u00b6 8(a) is not established for the reasons set out in the above discussion \nof AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(b), 7(e), and 7(f). AG \u00b6 8(c) is also not established, as Applicant and \nher husband visit their family in India once every two to five years, they communicate \nwith them frequently, and they provide financial support to them.     \n \nHowever, Applicant\u2019s deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the \nUnited States are sufficient to establish AG \u00b6 8(b). She has lived in the United States \nsince 2001. She has been a citizen since 2009. Her husband and children are citizens \nand residents of the United States. In addition, AG \u00b6 8(f) is established, as Applicant \nand her husband\u2019s assets in the United States total approximately $1.9 million, as \ncompared to their financial interests in India of approximately $75,000.  \n \n\n \n9 \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \npublic trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline B in my whole-person \nanalysis. Applicant\u2019s ties to India are outweighed by her deep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the United States. I am confident that she will resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the United States. \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline B, \nand evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has mitigated the trustworthiness concerns raised by her foreign family \nconnections and financial interests. Accordingly, I conclude s he has carried her \nburden of showing that it is clearly consistent with national security to grant her \neligibility for access to sensitive information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR:  \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.d:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n10 \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust \nposition. Eligibility for access to sensitive information is granted. \n \n \n \n \n \n_______________________ \nCandace Le\u2019i Garcia \nAdministrative Judge \n",

He claimed he neither \nreceives nor is entitled to any benefits from the Taiwanese military as a result of his \nservice. Applicant denied maintaining any contact with anyone in the Taiwanese military \nor government. \n \nApplicant entered the United States in 1990. He married a Taiwanese citizen in \nthe United States in 1992. They have two daughters born in the United States, ages 23 \nand 20. Both of his daughters are dual citizens of Taiwan and the United States. \nApplicant sent his daughters to live in Taiwan with their grandparents during extended \nperiods of time when they were babies. He and his wife were working and attending \nschool and they needed help to care for their children. His daughters\u2019 Taiwanese \ncitizenship allowed them to stay in Taiwan for extended periods.  \n \nApplicant obtained a master\u2019s degree from a U.S. university in 1993. He became \na naturalized U.S. citizen and received his U.S. passport in 2007. When asked whether \nhe had renounced his Taiwanese citizenship, Applicant responded he did not know he \nneeded to renounce it. (GE 1) Applicant is a dual citizen of the United States and \nTaiwan. In his SOR answer, Applicant stated that his wife is a dual citizen of the United \nStates and Taiwan. At hearing, he testified he was not sure whether his wife is a citizen \n\n \n3 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \nof Taiwan, or whether she has been or is a member of any foreign organization. (Tr. 30, \n32, 48)  \n \nApplicant travelled to Taiwan to visit his family every year or every other year \nsince he immigrated to the United States in 1990. (Tr. 63) He used his Taiwanese \npassport to travel to Taiwan in 2009, 2010, 2011, and twice in 2012. Applicant renewed \nhis Taiwanese passport in 2011, through a Taiwanese agency in the United States. His \nTaiwanese passport will not expire until 2021. He surrendered his Taiwanese passport \nto his facility security officer (FSO) for safekeeping. When asked whether he could pick \nup his passport when needed, Applicant stated \u201cI don\u2019t know if I can do that.\u201d However, \nhe had recently picked up his Taiwanese passport from his FSO at the request of a \ngovernment investigator before his background interview. Applicant and his wife \ntravelled to Taiwan in 2016 and 2017 to visit family and friends. They travelled to China \nin 1989, 2014, and April 2018. (Tr. 64) \n \nApplicant\u2019s 79-year-old mother is wheelchair-bound. She retired as a high school \nteacher. His father, 85, takes care of his mother. Both are citizens and residents of \nTaiwan. Applicant\u2019s father served in the Taiwanese military for many years and retired \nwith a high-level rank. According to Applicant\u2019s testimony, his father\u2019s work led him to \nofficial interactions with federal contractors and U.S. military personnel. On one of \nApplicant\u2019s exhibits, his father is identified as a Chinese colonel conducting negotiations \nwith a federal contractor. (AE 1(M)) His parents visited Applicant in the United States \nabout five years ago. (Tr. 28) \n \nApplicant claimed he did not know how long his father served in the Taiwanese \nmilitary before he retired, or what his father\u2019s duties were, other than repairing jet \nengines. When asked whether his father maintains any contact with anyone in the \nTaiwanese military or government, Applicant replied that he did not believe so, but that \nhe did not know. (Tr. 55) \n \nApplicant stated in his 2016 SCA that he communicates with his parents on a \nweekly basis via electronic and telephonic means, and his last in-person contact was in \nJanuary 2016. At his hearing, Applicant testified that he communicates with his parents \nonce every three months, and he last travelled to Taiwan in 2017. (Tr. 28)  \n \nApplicant has a sister, born in Taiwan, who is a naturalized U.S. citizen. She \nresides in the United States, is married, and works as a music teacher. His last in-\nperson contact with her was in 2017, when they both travelled to Taiwan to visit their \nparents. He communicates with her once every three months via electronic and \ntelephonic means. Applicant does not know whether his sister ever worked for the \nTaiwanese military or its government. (Tr. 58-59) \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law is 78 years old. She is a widower and a resident-citizen \nof Taiwan. In his 2016 SCA, Applicant indicated that he communicates with his mother-\nin-law once every three months via electronic and telephonic means, and his last in-\nperson contact was in 2017. His father-in-law is deceased. Applicant denied knowing \nwhat his father-in-law\u2019s occupation was before he died. He stated in his SOR answer \n\n \n4 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \nthat his mother-in-law never worked. During his testimony, Applicant claimed not \nknowing how frequently his wife contacts her mother, whether his mother-in-law worked \nfor the Taiwanese military or the Taiwanese government, or whether she owns any \nproperty in Taiwan. (Tr. 56-57, 64) He also claimed not knowing whether his wife has a \nTaiwanese passport. (Tr. 65) \n \nApplicant performed volunteer work at a Chinese language school and an \nassociation, helping with their administrative workload. Both organizations teach \nChinese language to Chinese people in the United States. According to Applicant, their \nobjective is to \u201cpromote multi-culturalism in the United States.\u201d (Tr. 29-30) He \nvolunteered at the school between 1998 and 2017. He volunteered at the association \nbetween 2011 and 2013. Both organizations deal mostly with Chinese citizens living in \nthe United States. \n \nApplicant does not intend to return to live in Taiwan. He testified that his family \n(wife and daughters), his job, and his life are in the United States. He considers the \nUnited States his home. (Tr. 30) He noted that he has lived in the United States for 30 \nyears and all of his assets and investments are in the United States (his and his wife\u2019s \njob, their savings, real estate, and retirement accounts). Applicant has a pension from \nhis employer, and large retirement and savings accounts in the United States. He \ndenied owning any investments, properties, or bank accounts in Taiwan or any other \nforeign country. \n \nApplicant stated in his 2016 SCA that he received a house in Taiwan as a gift, \nwith an estimated value of $10,000, in 1985. At hearing, he modified his statement and \ntestified that he mistakenly believed his parents had purchased their residence in \nTaiwan under his name to avoid a possible inheritance tax. Applicant claimed that upon \nrealizing the property raised security concerns, he asked his parents about the property. \nHe claimed his parents informed him that they did not purchase their home under his \nname and that the house was not his property. (Tr. 39) \n \nApplicant\u2019s reference has known Applicant since June 2015. Initially, they worked \ntogether in several important projects, and later Applicant worked under his supervision. \nApplicant was described as meticulous, reliable, devoted to his family, and incredibly \ndedicated to his work. His reference believes Applicant and his family are good U.S. \ncitizens and strongly supports approval of his clearance. (AE 1, S)  \n \nI take administrative notice of the following facts concerning the Republic of \nChina (Taiwan). The 1979 United States \u2013 People\u2019s Republic of China Joint \nCommunique switched diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing. In the Joint \nCommunique, the United States recognized the government of the People's Republic of \nChina as the sole legal government of China, acknowledging the Chinese position that \nthere is but one China and Taiwan is part of China. The Joint Communique also stated \nthat the people of the United States will maintain cultural, commercial, and other \nunofficial relations with the people of Taiwan. The United States and Taiwan enjoy a \nrobust unofficial relationship; however, the United States does not support Taiwan\u2019s \nindependence.  \n\n \n5 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \nThe Director of National Intelligence has determined that, in 2017, the leading \nstate intelligence threats to U.S. interests will continue to be Russia and China, based \non their services' capabilities, intent, and broad operational scope. \nAccording to the National Counterintelligence Executive, \"Chinese actors are the \nworld's most active and persistent perpetrators of economic espionage,\" and are \nconsidered \"aggressive and capable collectors of sensitive U.S. economic information \nand technology.\" Importantly, \"China's intelligence services, as well as private \ncompanies and other entities, frequently seek to exploit Chinese citizens or persons \nwith family ties to China who can use their insider access to corporate networks to steal \ntrade secrets using removable media devices or e-mail.\"  \nThere have been multiple cases involving the illegal export, or attempted illegal \nexport, of U.S. restricted, dual-use technology to Taiwan. The dual-use technologies \nthat have been targeted include: classified materials; Bryant center hole grinder, LED \nroad lights, and an oil pump (in support of North Korea's weapons of mass destruction \nand advanced weapons programs); drones, surveillance airplanes, and stealth \ntechnology relating to fighter planes exported to China; circuit boards; weapons-grade \ncarbon fiber; U.S. missile components (circular hermetic connectors and glass to metal \nseals) were exported to Iran by way of Taiwan. \nTaiwan is a global partner to the United States and shares much of the same \nhuman rights and economic views. \nPolicies \n \nThe SOR was issued under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive) (January \n2, 1992), as amended; and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG), \npromulgated by the Director of National Intelligence in Security Executive Agent \nDirective (SEAD) 4 (December 10, 2016), which are applicable to all adjudicative \ndecisions issued on or after June 8, 2017.  \n \nEligibility for access to classified information may be granted \u201conly upon a finding \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). \n \nThe AG list disqualifying and mitigating conditions for evaluating a person\u2019s \nsuitability for access to classified information. Any one disqualifying or mitigating \ncondition is not, by itself, conclusive. However, the AG should be followed where a case \ncan be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to \nclassified information. Each decision must reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense \n\n \n6 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \nconsideration of the whole person and the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a). All available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, \nmust be considered.  \n \nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government \nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, \nthe burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. The \napplicant bears the heavy burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue his or her security clearance.  \n \nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interest as their own. \nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n\u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \nEgan, 484 U.S. at 531; AG \u00b6 2(b). Clearance decisions are not a determination of the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned. They are merely an indication that the applicant has \nor has not met the strict guidelines the Government has established for issuing a \nclearance. \n \nAnalysis \n \nForeign Influence \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 6 explains the security concern about \u201cforeign contacts and interests\u201d \nstating: \n \n[I]f the individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, [he or \nshe] may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, \norganization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is \nvulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication \nunder this Guideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign \ncountry in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, \nincluding, but not limited to, such considerations as whether the foreign \ncountry is known to target United States citizens to obtain protected \ninformation and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nAG \u00b6 7 indicates two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n\n \n7 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information. \n \nApplicant was born, raised, and educated in Taiwan. His parents and mother-in-\nlaw are citizens and residents of Taiwan. His wife, two daughters, and sister are dual \nU.S. - Taiwanese citizens residing in the United States. He is close to his parents and \nmother-in-law (through his wife) and has frequent contact with them.1 Applicant denied \nhaving any financial accounts or property in Taiwan.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s relationships with residents of Taiwan create a concern about \nApplicant\u2019s \u201cobligation to protect sensitive information or technology\u201d and his desire to \nhelp his relatives who live in Taiwan. For example, if foreign intelligence agents or \ngovernment officials wanted to subject Applicant to coercion, they could exert pressure \non his relatives residing in Taiwan. Applicant would then be subject to coercion through \nhis relatives and classified information could potentially be compromised. \n \nAn applicant\u2019s possession of close family ties with their family living in a foreign \ncountry are not, as a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if an \napplicant has a close relationship with even one relative, living in a foreign country, this \nfactor alone is sufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially \nresult in the compromise of classified information. See generally ISCR Case No. 03-\n02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001).  \n \nThe nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, its \nhistory of intelligence gathering, and its human rights record are relevant in assessing \nthe likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable to government coercion \nor inducement. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the \nforeign country has an authoritarian government, a family member is associated with or \ndependent upon the government or the country is known to conduct intelligence \ncollection operations against the United States. The relationship of Taiwan with the \nUnited States, and its \u201chistory of conducting espionage against the United States, puts a \nheavy burden of proof on Applicant\u201d to demonstrate that his relationships with family \nmembers living in Taiwan do not pose a security risk. See ISCR Case No. 12-04780 at \n3 (App. Bd. Nov. 13, 2013). Applicant should not be placed into a position where he \nmight be forced to choose between loyalty to the United States and a desire to assist \nrelatives living in Taiwan.  \n \nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States. \u201cThe United \nStates has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information \nfrom any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, \nregardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to \n                                            \n1 See ISCR Case No. 09-03114 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Oct. 22, 2010) (contact once a month is \nconsidered to be \u201cfrequent\u201d under AG \u00b6\u00b6 7 and 8). \n\n \n8 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \nthose of the United States.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004). \nFurthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the United States \nover matters they view as important to their vital interests or national security. Finally, \nwe know friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the United States, \nespecially in the economic, scientific, and technical fields. See ISCR Case No. 00-0317, \n2002 DOHA LEXIS 83 at **15-16 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2002).  \n \nThere is no evidence that intelligence operatives from any foreign country seek \nor have sought classified or economic information from or through Applicant or his \nrelatives living in Taiwan. Nevertheless, it is not possible to rule out such a possibility in \nthe future. Applicant\u2019s relationships with family members living in Taiwan create a \npotential conflict of interest because these relationships are sufficiently close to raise a \nsecurity concern about his desire to assist relatives in Taiwan by providing sensitive or \nclassified information. Department Counsel produced substantial evidence of \nApplicant\u2019s contacts or relationships with family living in Taiwan, raising the issue of \npotential foreign pressure or attempted exploitation. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) are established \nand further inquiry is necessary about potential application of any mitigating conditions.  \n \nAG \u00b6 8 lists four conditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns \nincluding: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country \nis so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected \nto resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest;  \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; and \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n \nThe Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the \napplicability of mitigating conditions as follows: \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance \n\n \n9 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \nof a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for \naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b). \n \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013). \n \nThere is a rebuttable presumption that a person has ties of affection for, or \nobligation to, their immediate family members. See generally ISCR Case No. 01-03120, \n2002 DOHA LEXIS 94 at *8 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2002). Applicant has ties of affection for \nhis parents, extended family, and by marriage to his in-laws, as indicated by his \nfrequent contact with them.   \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a), 8(b), and 8(c) are not applicable. Applicant has frequent contact with \nhis parents and mother-in-law, who are citizens and residents of Taiwan. He has \ntelephonic or computer communication with his parents weekly (based on his 2016 \nSCA) or quarterly (based on his hearing testimony. Since immigrating to the United \nStates in 1990, Applicant travelled to Taiwan every year or every other year. He \nbecame a naturalized U.S. citizen and was granted a U.S. passport in 2007. He used \nhis Taiwanese passport to travel to Taiwan in 2009, 2010, 2011, and twice in 2012. \nApplicant and his wife travelled to Taiwan in 2016 and 2017 to visit family and friends. \nThey travelled to China in 1989, 2014, and 2018. He denied knowing how frequently his \nwife communicates with her mother. He and his wife have visited Taiwan frequently \nsince 1990, when he immigrated.  \n \nApplicant renewed his Taiwanese passport in 2011, and surrendered it to his \nfacility security officer when made aware of the security concerns it may raise. He has \nnot renounced his Taiwanese citizenship. It appears that his wife and children continue \nto use their Taiwanese citizenship privileges and passport for their ease of travel. \nApplicant\u2019s father retired as a high-ranking military officer in Taiwan. He does not know \nwhether his father has any contact with Taiwanese military or government personnel. \nConsidering the record as a whole, Applicant failed to meet his burden of showing there \nis \u201clittle likelihood that [his relationships with family living in Taiwan] could create a risk \nfor foreign influence or exploitation.\u201d   \n \nAG \u00b6 8(b) partially applies. A key factor in the AG \u00b6 8(b) analysis is Applicant\u2019s \n\u201cdeep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S.\u201d Applicant\u2019s relationship \nwith the United States must be weighed against the potential conflict of interest created \nby his relationships with family living in Taiwan.  \n \nI considered the positive economic and long-standing security partnership \nbetween the United States and Taiwan based on shared values. The United States has \na vested interest in maintaining its strong, unofficial relations with Taiwan and assisting \n\n \n10 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \nTaiwan in maintaining its defensive capability. There is no evidence that the Taiwanese \ngovernment or those conducting espionage have approached or threatened Applicant or \nhis family to coerce Applicant for classified or sensitive information.  \n \nApplicant has established strong connections to the United States. He \nimmigrated in 1990, and became a U.S. citizen in 2007. His wife and children live with \nhim in the United States. He owns a home and all of his financial interests are in the \nUnited States, including his job, a pension, and retirement and savings accounts. He \nalso has a strong connection to a co-worker and supervisor.  \n \nNotwithstanding, Applicant also has maintained his strong connections to his \nfamily members living in Taiwan, as evidenced by his frequent travels to Taiwan, his \ndaughters living with their grandparents for extended periods of time, his frequent \ncontacts with family members there, and his wife and daughters maintaining and using \ntheir Taiwanese passports and exercising their Taiwanese citizenship privileges. \nApplicant used his Taiwanese passport to travel to Taiwan after he was issued his U.S. \npassport in 2007, and he visited a Taiwanese government office in the United States to \nrenew it in 2011.  \n \nI considered Applicant\u2019s father\u2019s high-ranking officer position in the Taiwanese \nmilitary. I also evaluated his father\u2019s age and that he retired many years ago. \nNotwithstanding, Applicant\u2019s lack of answers about his father\u2019s position in the military, \nhis father\u2019s possible contacts with Taiwanese military or government personnel, his \nwife\u2019s maintaining a Taiwanese passport, and his testimony denying any knowledge of \nhis wife\u2019s contacts with her mother, or whether his wife belongs to a foreign organization \nor association, create doubts on his favorable evidence. \n \nConsidering the evidence as a whole, I find that Applicant\u2019s connections to the \nUnited States are outweighed by his connections to Taiwan in the security analysis. \nForeign influence security concerns under Guideline B are not mitigated.    \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, and under the whole-person \nconcept. (AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and 2(c)) I have incorporated my comments under Guideline B in \nmy whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG were addressed under that \nguideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant entered the United States in 1990, and was naturalized as a U.S. \ncitizen in 2007 along with his wife. His wife and U.S.-born daughters are dual U.S.-\nTaiwanese citizens. He has worked for several federal contractors over the years, and \nfor his current employer and clearance sponsor since 2014. This is his first SCA. \nA Guideline B decision concerning a foreign country must take into consideration \nthe geopolitical situation and dangers in that country including from intelligence agents. \nNotwithstanding the U.S. \u2013 Taiwanese long-standing positive relations and strong trade \n\n \n11 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \nrelationship, the danger of coercion from the Taiwanese or Chinese governments or \ntheir intelligence agents is possible. Applicant\u2019s favorable evidence is insufficient to \nmitigate the foreign influence security concerns. The weight of the evidence does not \nsupport granting Applicant\u2019s clearance.  \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:    \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.c:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.d \u2013 1.i:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

The Department of Defense (DOD) could not make \nthe affirmative findings necessary to grant a security clearance. DOD issued Applicant a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR), dated September 7, 2017, detailing security concerns \nraised by financial considerations (Guideline F). The action was taken under Executive \nOrder (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, \n1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the Director \nof National Intelligence issued Security Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for access to \nClassified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs). The guidelines \nare applicable to all individuals who require initial or continued eligibility for access to \n\n \n  2 \n \nclassified information or eligibility to hold a sensitive position. The AGs were made \neffective on or after June 8, 2017.  \n \nApplicant provided her notarized answer on November 27, 2017, and requested \na hearing. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of \nhearing on August 20, 2018, for a hearing on September 21 2018. The hearing was \nheld as scheduled. The Government\u2019s seven exhibits (GE) 1-7 and Applicant\u2019s 10 \nexhibits (AE) A-J were admitted without objection. Applicant\u2019s post-hearing exhibits (AE \nK-AE M) were entered into evidence on October 25, 2018, without objection. DOHA \nreceived the transcript on October 3, 2018. The record closed on October 25, 2018.   \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nThe SOR alleges a Chapter bankruptcy discharge in 2001, and a Chapter 13 \ndischarge in February 2010. The SOR also alleges 21 delinquent debts totaling \napproximately $67,472, of which $58,700 is student loan debt. Applicant admitted the \nbankruptcies under the financial considerations guideline. She admitted SOR 1.c \nthrough 1.i; she denied the medical accounts at SOR 1.j through 1n; and she admitted \nSOR 1.o through 1.w, with explanations. The delinquent debts include a rental \njudgment, a car insurance judgment, two department of education loans, two cable \ndebts, two phone debts, five medical debts, a utility debt, four parking tickets, and a pest \ncontrol debt.  \n \nApplicant is 44 years old and divorced. She has two adult-aged daughters, 25 \nand 24 years old. After high school, she received several computer certifications. She \nhas worked for defense contractors from 2008 to 2018. Since March 2018, she has \nbeen employed by a contractor in the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) office of a \nFederal agency. In her job, she processes document requests for time sensitive delivery \nto the requestor. Applicant has had three period of unemployment: February to July \n2011; October to December 2011; and August to November 2012. Applicant believed \nher Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2001 was caused periods of unemployment resulting in \nbills before 2001. She also recalled that she had a car repossessed before the \nbankruptcy. The Chapter 13 bankruptcy that she successfully discharged in February \n2010, was caused by working on contracts that expired and looking for new \nemployment. (G1 at 12-18; Tr. 9-10, 45-46) \n \n \nSOR 1.c \u2013 The Government documentation shows that the judgment was filed in \nApril 2011, after Applicant\u2019s February 2010 Chapter 13 bankruptcy discharge. In her \nNovember 2017 answer to the SOR, Applicant claimed that she disputed the judgment. \nDuring her testimony, she indicated she spoke with the landlord and paid the debt in \n2010. Upon further questioning about the reason for the debt, she indicated that she \nhad medical surgery and had to take short-term disability and did not get paid. She \nintended to check her paperwork to determine when she paid the judgment. (GE 4 at 5; \nTr. 34, 48) The debt is unresolved.  \n \n\n \n  3 \n \n \nSOR 1.d \u2013 Government documentation indicates that a judgment was filed \nagainst Applicant in 2015. In her answer, Applicant claimed that she paid the judgment \nand submitted AE B and AE G to establish that the judgment was paid. Even though the \ninsurer\u2019s name does not appear in either exhibit. In October 2017, the author of AE B \ninstructed her to pay the $628 balance and the judgment and suspension and judgment \nwould be removed. In February 2018, the state motor vehicle agency advised her that \njudgment and suspension was removed based on the agencies receipt of an order of \nsatisfaction. (AE B, AE G; Tr. 51-53) The allegation is resolved for Applicant.  \n \n \nSOR 1.e, 1.f \u2013 the two allegations represent student loans for Applicant\u2019s two \ndaughters. Government documentation shows that the loans became delinquent in April \n2015 and were no longer in forbearance as on June and July 2018. Applicant cosigned \nfor both loans, but did not realize that she was liable as cosigner if her daughters \ndefaulted on the loans. Applicant\u2019s post-hearing documentation reflects that the loans \nhave been restored to forbearance, are in grace, or in repayment. (GE 2; AE C, AE D, \nAE K, AE L; Tr. 34-36, 53-6) \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines, which \nare not inflexible rules of law, should be applied with common sense and the general \nfactors of the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. The protection of the national security is the \nparamount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(d) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel \nbeing considered for national security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security decision. \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nThe security concerns of the guideline for financial considerations are set forth in \nAG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \n\n \n  4 \n \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \n \nAG \u00b619 describes conditions that may be disqualifying: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \n \n \nAG \u00b620 describes conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \nThe SOR lists eight delinquent student loan debts and five medical debts. The \ntotal amount of debt is $51,311. The Government credit reports substantiate that the \ndebts became delinquent between July 2010 and December 2016. The large amount of \ndebt accumulated over a six-year period supports the application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and \n19(c).  \n \n\n \n  5 \n \nWhile AE A shows that Applicant has paid a portion of his delinquent debt \nbetween 2013 and 2018, a substantial but unknown portion of his student loan debt \nremains unpaid. Applicant stated in his May 2017 PSI that he intended to contact the \ncreditors and pay the debts. At the hearing, however, he stated that his work-related \ntravel schedule was hindering his ability to address the delinquent debts. During the \nhearing, he restated his intention to contact the creditors and negotiate payment plans \nor resume payments. Applicant\u2019s failure to show in his post-hearing submission (AE A) \nthat he has a defined plan to repay any of his creditors continues to cast doubt on his \njudgment. AE \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \n \n \nThe record indicates that Applicant\u2019s debts started to become delinquent in July \n2010, when he was working at one of his low-paying jobs. In 2013, Applicant began \nproviding money and food to his father who had lost his job, resulting in Applicant falling \nbehind in his financial obligations. In 2015, his father resumed working. The low paying \njobs and his father\u2019s two-year period of unemployment warrant some mitigation under \nthe first prong of AG \u00b6 20(b).  \n \nHowever, to receive full credit under AG \u00b6 20(b), an applicant must produce \nevidence that shows he acted responsibly under the circumstances. Applicant has been \nworking for his current employer since February 2015. When his father returned to work \nin 2015, Applicant no longer had to support him. Assuming that the payment amounts \nposted and corresponding dates in AE A were in fact payments, Applicant made only \nfour payments to the servicer in 2015, only six payments in 2016, only four  payments in \n2017, and only one payment in January 2018, although it is highly unlikely the payment \nwas $32,176 as is posted in AE A. Applicant does not receive full mitigation under AG \u00b6 \n20(b) because his evidence fails to show consistent payment documentation on his \nstudent loans since 2013.  \n \n \nApplicant has never had financial counseling. Though AE A reflects that he has \nbeen in contact with the student loan servicer identified at SOR 1.a, there is no \nevidence to support a conclusion that his delinquent student loans and medical \naccounts are under control. With scant documentation of payments or payment plans, I \nam unable to conclude that Applicant has made a good-faith effort to repay his debts. \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts are not mitigated or excused by his work-related travel \nschedule or his uncorroborated claims of having the student loan debts consolidated. \nAG\u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) do not apply.  \n \nPersonal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concerns related to personal conduct: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \n\n \n  6 \n \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result \nin an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security \nclearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national security \neligibility: \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 16, the applicable disqualifying conditions are:  \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 17, conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur.  \n \n \nConcerning SOR 2.a and 2.b, Applicant denied in his October 2016 e-QIP that he \nhad federal debt and that any of his debts had been turned over to a collection agency \nin the past seven (7) years. Those two negative answers were false. Applicant informed \nthe OPM investigator in May 2017 that his omissions were inadvertent. In his February \n2018 answer to SOR 2.a and 2.b, he admitted both allegations. During the hearing, he \nexplained that he provided a negative answer to SOR 2.a because he thought that SOR \n1.a and 1.g through 1.l student loan accounts were consolidated and current. He \nprovided no evidence to support that claim. He defended his negative response to SOR \n2.b by claiming that his review of a December 2015 credit report showed no collection \naccounts. That claim is not credible as the Government credit reports show that 11 of \nthe 13 accounts listed in the SOR had become delinquent by December 2015. \nConsidering Applicant\u2019s inconsistent explanations for his negative responses, and the \nabsence of supporting documentation for either response, I conclude that Applicant \ndeliberately falsified his October 2016 e-QIP. AG \u00b6 16(a) applies. \n \n\n \n  7 \n \n \nApplicant did not make prompt, good-faith efforts to the falsification before being \nconfronted with the information that the OPM investigator presented to him in May 2017. \nAt the September 2018 hearing, Applicant advanced two claims for the October 2016 \nomissions that are not credible. AG \u00b6 17(a) does not apply. Even though almost three \nyears have passed since the falsifications, Applicant has provided insufficient evidence \nto establish that his conduct is unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6 17(c) does not apply. AG \u00b617(d) \ndoes not apply because Applicant has not acknowledged that he falsified the \nGovernment security application.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nI have examined the evidence under the guidelines for financial considerations \nand personal conduct in the context of the nine general factors of the whole-person \nconcept listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \naccess to classified information must be an overall common-sense judgment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nApplicant is 31 years old and single. In September 2008, he earned an \nassociate\u2019s degree in business and collision refinishing. After working several low-\npaying jobs between 2006 and 2014, Applicant began working as a service technician \nfor his current employer in February 2015. From 2013 to 2015, Applicant discovered he \nwas having problems paying his bills because he was providing monetary assistance \nand food to his unemployed father. His father resumed working in 2015.  \n \nIn his October 2016 e-QIP, Applicant deliberately falsified the e-QIP by denying \nhe had federal delinquent debt and that he had debts turned over to collection agencies \nin the last seven years. He stated in his May 2017 PSI that the omissions were \ninadvertent and he intended to contact the creditors and repay the debts. He provided \nsome evidence of occasional payments to a student loan servicer. But, he provided no \nevidence of payments on the student loans since January 2018.  \n \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has noted under the financial considerations guideline \nthat an applicant should demonstrate a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d of payments that \nshows overall debt reduction. Though Applicant is not required to demonstrate he has \n\n \n  8 \n \npaid off all debts listed in the SOR, he should show that he has a plan to repay the \ndelinquent debts and has taken consistent steps to implement the plan. See ISCR Case \nNo. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) \n  \n \nWhile AE A shows sporadic payments on Applicant\u2019s student loans between \n2013 and January 2018, the exhibit provides no information showing to which listed \nstudent loan debts the payments apply. The exhibit does not show whether any of the \nstudent loan debts have been returned to a current status or placed in forbearance or \nrehabilitation. The record contains no evidence that Applicant has taken any action to \npay off the medical accounts, even though he has discretionary income of $400 to $500 \nevery month. Judging by the totality of the evidence, Applicant has not overcome the \nsecurity concerns based on the guidelines for financial considerations and personal \nconduct.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.m: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a, 2.b:   \n \n \nAgainst Applicant  \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security interests of the United States to grant \nApplicant eligibility for access to classified information. Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied.  \n \n \n \n_________________ \nPaul J. Mason \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Crowley, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nKILMARTIN, Robert J., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant mitigated the security concerns under Guideline G (alcohol \nconsumption). Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n     Statement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on November 21, 2016. \nOn September 13, 2017, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued Applicant a Statement \nof Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline G. The DOD CAF acted \nunder Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AGs) implemented by DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on October 5, 2017, admitting the allegations in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.c. He also requested a hearing before an administrative judge. The case \nwas assigned to me on October 16, 2018. On November 20, 2018, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was scheduled for \nDecember 5, 2018. I convened the hearing as scheduled.  \n12/27/2018\n\n2 \n \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4 were admitted into evidence without \nobjection. At the hearing, Applicant testified on his own behalf and provided four character \nreference letters that were marked as Appellant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A - D. DOHA received the \ntranscript (Tr.) on December 14, 2018.  \n \n  Findings of Fact1 \n \nApplicant is 39 years old. He graduated from high school in 2003 and he completed \nsome college.  He enlisted in the Air National Guard (ANG) in 2003 and served honorably \nfor 13\u00bd years until late 2016.  Applicant was married in February 2018 and he reports no \nchildren. (Tr. 40-46) He deployed three times overseas  Qatar (2005), Kyrgyzstan (2009), \nand Qatar again (2011). (Tr. 42) He attained the rank of staff sergeant (E-5) and served \nas a warehouse supervisor and logistician. Applicant earned numerous military awards \nincluding two Air Force Achievement Medals. (Tr. 44) In February 2018, he moved with \nhis wife from state A to state B  for a pending job offer with a federal contractor in state \nB, which is why he needs a security clearance. (Tr. 24, 56)  \n \nOn November 21, 2016, Applicant signed a Security Clearance Application \n(SCA),2 and in section 22 (Police Record) he disclosed an arrest for driving under the \ninfluence (DUI) of alcohol in state A in July 2009. In his Answer to the SOR \u00b6 1.a, Applicant \nstated that he was drinking to celebrate a friend\u2019s birthday, after a military trip. Applicant \nmade a mistake in driving his friend to various bars while consuming alcohol. Applicant \ndrove into a DUI checkpoint one mile from his home, where he was arrested and charged \nwith DUI, first offense. He obtained an attorney and pled guilty to a reduced charge of \nreckless driving. Nonetheless, he was required to have an interlock device installed on \nhis vehicle for nine months, to insure no recurrences.  \n \n Applicant disclosed his arrest for DUI, second offense, in September 2010, as \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b. He was out partying with friends in a bar, but he had pre-established \nhis girlfriend as his designated driver for that evening. (Tr. 49-50) However, after several \nrounds of drinks, Applicant noticed that she was also drinking and unable to drive them \nall home in her van. Applicant ingested several beers and shots of whiskey. (Answer) \nThey tried to call a taxi cab, but it was 4 a.m. After trying unsuccessfully for several hours, \nApplicant decided he could drive his girlfriend\u2019s van (sans interlock device) himself. (Tr.  \n50) He was stopped and arrested for DUI. He pled guilty to DUI, first offense, since the \nearlier charge was reduced to reckless driving. (Tr. 50) He disclosed that he was ordered \nto seek alcohol counseling, which he completed, and pay court costs and a fine. \n \nApplicant\u2019s third alcohol-related incident occurred in October 2015 when he was \narrested and charged with DUI and driving on a revoked license. The latter charge was \n                                                          \n1 Unless stated otherwise, the source of the information in this section is Applicant\u2019s November 21, 2016 \nSecurity Clearance Application (SCA) (GE 1) and his summary of clearance interview by a background \ninvestigator. (GE 4).  \n \n2 GE 1.  \n \n\n3 \n \ndismissed as a mistake since Applicant\u2019s license had merely expired. (Answer) Applicant \nhad recently lost his best friend to addiction and he was grieving. He went to a local bar \nwithin two miles of his home to watch football and play in a fantasy football league. (Tr. \n51) He was there for seven hours and ingested five beers and two shots of whiskey. He \nhad eaten lunch, and an appetizer later. When he left, he was pulled over by a police \ncruiser while turning into his housing development. Applicant testified that he respectfully \ndeclined the field sobriety test because he had recently had knee surgery. (Tr. 77) This \nwas immediately reported to Applicant\u2019s chain of command at the ANG, and he was \nforced to resign his full-time position while being discharged after 13 \u00bd years of service \nwith a general under honorable conditions discharge. Applicant was in the process of \nhaving a home built with his fiance\u2019 (now wife) and he did not have the funds available to \nvigorously contest the DUI charge.  \n \nAlthough he was adamant that he was not intoxicated in the October 2015 incident, \nApplicant pled guilty to DUI. Applicant was sentenced to five days in jail. He also paid \ncourt costs and fines, was ordered to install an interlock device until 2019, and attend a \nstate A DUI safety and treatment program. He started the education component of that \nprogram in January 2016 and completed six weeks of three-hour lectures. Then, he \ncompleted six weeks of the intervention portion, completing the entire program in June \n2016. He was diagnosed as alcohol use disorder (AUD) moderate during his treatment. \n(records attached to Answer) Applicant also voluntarily attended Alcoholic\u2019s Anonymous \n(AA) meetings, and he intends to continue to attend AA meetings in his newly adopted \nhome state. (Tr. 58)  \n \nApplicant testified credibly that he had his last drink in November 2016 and he is \na changed man since getting married and moving. (Tr. 82) He is no longer exposed to a \nculture of profligate alcohol consumption. It broke his heart to get discharged and lose his \nchosen career. (Tr. 85) He is coaching baseball and football and hopes to start a family \nsoon in his recently purchased home in state B.  He self-reported all of his offenses, and \nhe has cooperated fully in the background investigation. Applicant provided four favorable \ncharacter reference letters, which all attest to his integrity, work ethic, and trustworthiness. \n(AE A-D) He fully disclosed his offenses to his new federal contractor employer. (Tr. 85)  \n \n  \n                                         Policies \n \n \nDOD took action in this case under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AGs) implemented by \nDOD on September 1, 2006. \n \nOn December 10, 2016, the Director of National Intelligence signed Security \nExecutive Agent Directive 4 (SEAD 4), implementing new AGs effective within the DOD \non June 8, 2017. Accordingly, I have applied the June 8, 2017 AGs in this decision.  \n \n\n4 \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period and a careful weighing \nof a number of variables of an individual\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that \nthe individual is an acceptable security risk. This is known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \n \n \n \n\n5 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  Analysis \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n \nThe security concern for alcohol consumption is set out in AG \u00b6 21:   \n \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 22. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under  \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder; \nand \n \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional (e.g., \nphysician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical social \nworker) of alcohol use disorder. \n \n \nApplicant had three alcohol-related incidents in a six-year period from 2009 \u2013 2015.  \nIn 2015, he was diagnosed with alcohol use disorder (AUD), moderate, based on his \nvoluntary disclosures. He complied with all recommendations for treatment.  AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a) \nand (d) are applicable.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 23 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations; and \n \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations.  \n \n\n6 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s last alcohol-related arrest was in October 2015. He had recently lost \nhis best friend and was grieving. He has been sober for more than two years. Although \nhe was diagnosed with AUD, moderate, during his treatment program, he has complied \nwith all treatment recommendations and continues to attend AA meetings. He has \ncompleted all recommended lifestyle adjustments. He recently married and moved to \nstate B where he purchased a new home. He is committed to his new wife and job and \nleads a life of abstinence. An inference can be drawn that Applicant has confronted his \nproclivity for alcohol, and he is appropriately coping with his diagnosed disorder. He has \nmet his burden in establishing that his excessive drinking occurred under unusual \ncircumstances, and that it is unlikely to recur. It does not cast doubt on his trustworthiness, \nreliability,  or judgement. The above-mentioned mitigating conditions apply with respect \nto SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.c.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline G in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines. Notably, Applicant served in the Air National Guard \nfor 13 1/2 years. He paid a high price for his mistakes in losing his chosen career. He has \ncompleted counseling and all other requirements. He purchased a new home in a different \nstate and recently married. He has matured and is committed to his sober lifestyle. Most \nimportantly, Applicant resolved the specific violations alleged in the SOR and he no longer   \nconsumes alcohol.  \n \n \n \n \n\n7 \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a -1.c:                          For Applicant \n \n \n \n                       \n       Conclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n                                \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \n                                                    Robert J.

The case was assigned to me on May 17, 2018. The \n                                                     \n1 The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) effective on June 8, 2017. \n \n  12/13/2018\n\n \n2 \n \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued a notice of hearing on June 12, 2018, \nand the hearing was convened on July 11, 2018. Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 15 \nwere admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant and a witness testified. The \nrecord was held open for Applicant to submit documentary evidence. He submitted \nApplicant Exhibit (AE) A, consisting of letters regarding debt resolution efforts and two \ncharacter letters. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on July 24, 2018. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 52-year-old aircraft mechanic for a defense contractor, employed \nsince 2009. He was laid off in March 2018 pending security eligibility. He previously \nworked for another company from 1999 to 2009, until he was terminated for his \ninvolvement in an embezzlement scheme. Applicant graduated from high school in 1983, \nand honorably served in the U.S. Army from 1983 to 1998, including a deployment to \nSaudi Arabia during Operation Desert Storm. He was married in 1986 and divorced in \n2003. He reconciled with his spouse in 2013, but remains unmarried. He has two children \nand three step children; all but one is an adult. He does not currently hold a security \nclearance. \n \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline E, that Applicant was a defendant in a civil suit \nfor embezzlement of $627,000 from his former employer. Applicant was terminated from \nemployment as a result of his involvement in the theft. This incident was cross-alleged \nunder Guideline J, for criminal conduct. Also, under Guideline E, the SOR alleges \nApplicant falsified his 2014 SCA by failing to disclose his arrests in 2002 and 2011 for \ndriving while intoxicated (DWI), and the civil lawsuit described above. In addition, the SOR \nalleges Applicant deliberately falsified his 2010 and 2015 personal subject interviews by \ndeliberately concealing the reason he was terminated from his job in 2009, claiming he \nwas fired because of his connection to his co-defendant and that he was not involved in \ntheft from the company. Under Guideline F, the SOR alleges the embezzlement incident, \nand three delinquent credit accounts that have been charged-off or are in collections, \ntotaling approximately $20,000. \n \nApplicant worked for his previous employer from 1999 to 2009. In about 2000, he \nbecame friendly with a co-worker (B), who was the company comptroller. They eventually \nbecame romantically involved. Eventually B became pregnant with Applicant\u2019s child, who \nwas born in 2002. From about 2002 to 2008, B used company funds to pay for her \npersonal expenses, credit cards, mortgage, utilities, and other items, and used company \nfunds to buy items for Applicant, including an all-terrain vehicle (ATV) and two rifles. B \nprovided a credit card to Applicant in furtherance of the crime. Applicant stated that B \nusually paid the credit card for him, but that he also contributed money to her on occasion, \nbut was not sure how it was spent. Among other uses of the credit card, B instructed \nApplicant to use his card to purchase $27,800 in gift cards, and turn them over to another \nemployee at the company. Applicant suspected B was stealing from the company and \nsuspected his supervisor was involved.2 At one point, B took Applicant\u2019s credit card from \n                                                     \n2 Applicant also implicated the company president in a separate scheme to overcharge on aircraft parts, \nbut the allegations were not supported nor are they relevant to Applicant\u2019s case. \n\n \n3 \n \nhim during a dispute, but it was later returned to Applicant by his supervisor. Applicant \ndid not question why his supervisor would have his credit card, nor did he question B\u2019s \nextravagant purchases and credit card use even though he suspected she did not earn \nenough to afford them. At least a year before the company discovered the theft, Applicant \nacknowledged that he knew about the scheme, and maintained his involvement. When \nApplicant was confronted by the company president in 2009, Applicant admitted to the \ntheft scheme, but maintained that he only received the property purchased with stolen \nfunds. Applicant continues to assert that although he knew of the theft and purchases \nwith stolen funds, he did not directly steal from the company. He stated that he never \ndirectly asked B about the origins of her money or questioned B about purchases and \nunusual credit card use. He suspected B and his supervisor in the theft scheme, but never \nreported his suspicions to company officials or law enforcement for fear of losing his job. \nOn March 30, 2009, when confronted by the company president, Applicant acknowledged \nthe theft scheme. He was fired. In October 2009, B moved into Applicant\u2019s home with him \nand Applicant considered her his \u201ccommon law wife.\u201d (GE 4) \n \nApplicant and B were sued by the company in May 2009, for embezzlement, \nbreach of fiduciary duty, fraud, conversion, theft, and falsification of records. In 2010, the \ncourt granted the company a partial summary judgment as to liability only. B was \nconvicted and imprisoned for theft of approximately $627,000 from the company. \nApplicant\u2019s attorney requested the company agree to allow Applicant to return property \npurchased with company funds in lieu of prosecuting him. This was considered a partial \nreimbursement. Although Applicant\u2019s attorney told him that he was likely to be sued, \nApplicant claimed that he was never served with the complaint or appeared in court, nor \nwas he aware of the lawsuit and summary judgment until he received the SOR in 2018. \nFor these reasons, he asserted that he did not report the lawsuit on his 2014 SCA. \n \nIn his 2014 SCA, Applicant listed that he was fired in 2009 \u201cbecause of conflict of \ninterest.\u201d Applicant was interviewed several times by Office of Personnel Management \n(OPM) investigators, including in 2010 and 2015. In those interviews, he claimed that he \nwas fired for his personal connection to B, but that he was not involved in any theft of \nmoney from the company. In a 2012 OPM interview, Applicant became uncomfortable \nduring questioning regarding the theft scheme. Applicant refused to answer questions \nrelated to B\u2019s involvement, and he abruptly left the interview before it was complete. (GE \n4) In testimony, Applicant admitted that he was not fully truthful in the answers he provided \nthe investigators with respect to his involvement in the company theft scheme, stating \nthat he was only 50% honest. \n \nIn 2002, Applicant was arrested and charged with driving while intoxicated (DWI). \nHe was placed on probation and the charge was dismissed at its conclusion. In 2011, he \nwas arrested for DWI while driving on a military installation. He was administratively \nbarred from driving on base for one year. Applicant did not report these arrests or charges \non his 2014 SCA. Despite discussing them in his 2012 interview, he again failed to report \nthe charges on his 2014 SCA. He testified that he did not fully understand the SCA \nquestions related to criminal charges involving alcohol. \n \n\n \n4 \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant is indebted to a credit card company on an account \nthat has been charged-off for about $14,943. Applicant noted after the hearing, that he \ncontacted the creditor and they were unable to find the account. Applicant\u2019s credit report \nof November 2014 (GE 14) shows the account was opened in 2001 and the last activity \nwas in 2012. Applicant is listed as an authorized user on the account and disputed his \nresponsibility for it. Two other delinquent accounts placed in collection were resolved after \nthe hearing. (AE A) \n \nDuring testimony, Applicant was less than forthcoming, guarded, often unclear and \ndisjointed when answering direct questions related to his involvement in the theft scheme \nand his knowledge at the time. He asserted that he was trying to answer questions \ntruthfully and did not want to give deceptive answers. Applicant\u2019s current human \nresources and assistant facility security officer testified to Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness and \nhonesty. The witness also provided a positive character letter, claiming that Applicant has \novercome his past behavior, and it is no longer a concern. Likewise, Applicant\u2019s current \nsite manager also attested to Applicant\u2019s good standing with the company, and stated \nthat Applicant has not acted in a way to raise questions about his judgment. Both \nreferences claimed in similar language, that Applicant misunderstood SCA security \nquestions or answered in a manner unique to him when he felt that questions were \n\u201cmisleading, misinformed or accusatory.\u201d They also claimed that Applicant \u201creached out\u201d \nto all of his creditors to resolve his delinquencies. \n \nPolicies \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \n \nNational security eligibility is predicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria \ncontained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. \nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies \nthese guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider a person\u2019s stability, trustworthiness, reliability, \ndiscretion, character, honesty, and judgment. AG \u00b6 1(b). \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \n\n \n5 \n \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 at 3, \n1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993). \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02- \n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 1(d). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline E; Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the personal conduct security concern: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case. The following disqualifying condition are potentially applicable: \n \n\n \n6 \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, \nsecurity official, competent medical or mental health professional involved \nin making a recommendation relevant to a national security eligibility \ndetermination, or other official government representative; \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may \nnot properly safeguard protected information. This includes but is not limited \nto consideration of: \n \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client \nconfidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized \nrelease of sensitive corporate or other government protected \ninformation . . .  \n \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations;  \n \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other employer\u2019s \ntime or resources;  \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes:  \n \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing; and  \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case. The personal conduct alleged is generally sufficient to implicate \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 16 (a), (b), (d), (e), and (g). \n \n\n \n7 \n \nGuideline E includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising from \npersonal conduct. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 and \nfound the following relevant: \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur;  \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activities was unwitting, \nhas ceased, or occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations. \nApplicant\u2019s participation in the theft scheme over a period of years is not mitigated \nby time, circumstance, or other actions he asserts mitigates his behavior. Applicant has \nnot fully acknowledged the full extent of his involvement, but claimed he was only a \npassive and mostly unwitting participation as a receiver of stolen property. The evidence \ndoes not support his assertions. Applicant\u2019s suspicions of B\u2019s criminal conduct were \nraised long before he was confronted by the company president. Based on his romantic \ninvolvement and fear of losing his job, he chose to bury his head in the sand and did not \nask obvious questions about the source of B\u2019s money. After eventually acknowledging \nthat B was stealing from the company, he should have known that his involvement in \nreceiving property bought with stolen funds and the unusual use of a credit card, \nimplicated him in the scheme. I find that Applicant willingly participated in the theft \nscheme, and in another error in judgment, allowed B to live with him after the crime was \ndiscovered and he was fired. He has not offered evidence of counseling nor taken full \nresponsibility for his actions. Based on his guarded answers to direct questions during \nthe hearing, he has not shown sufficient evidence of acknowledgment of his behavior and \nefforts in rehabilitation. I am not convinced that this incident is behind him or that similar \nirresponsible behavior will not recur. No mitigation fully applies to SOR \u00b6 1.a. \nApplicant deliberately failed to provide truthful answers regarding his DWI arrests \nin his 2014 SCA. He has not shown sufficient evidence of misunderstanding the SCA \nquestions or his inability to recall previous arrests and charges. No mitigation is fully \napplicable to SOR \u00b6 1.b. Applicant was unaware of the lawsuit filed against him as it was \napparently resolved with his return of property purchased with stolen funds as a partial \n\n \n8 \n \nreimbursement, and he was not criminally charged. I am convinced that, based on \nApplicant\u2019s testimony that he did not knowingly fail to report the lawsuit in his 2014 SCA. \nHowever, the record evidence is sufficient to show that Applicant was intentionally \nuntruthful when he failed to fully describe his involvement with B, the theft scheme, and \nreason for his firing, during his 2010 and 2015 OPM interviews. No mitigation fully applies \nto SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e. \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . .  \n \nThe relevant disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19 include: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(d) deceptive or illegal financial practices such as embezzlement, employee \ntheft, check fraud, expense account fraud, mortgage fraud, filing deceptive \nloan statements and other intentional financial breaches of trust. \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, testimony, and the documentary evidence in the record \nare sufficient to establish the disqualifying conditions above. \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially relevant: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant\u2019s involvement in a financial theft scheme from his company was fully \ndetailed above, and has not been mitigated by his partial reimbursement of property \npurchased with stolen funds. He has failed to fully acknowledge his involvement and \ninstead chose to bury his head in the sand. Rather than cutting off his relationship once \nthe theft scheme came to light and he was fired, he instead chose to live with B. He \ncontinues to assert his minimal participation, and has not shown rehabilitative actions. \nSOR \u00b6 2.a has not been mitigated. The debts remaining under SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b-2.d, were \naddressed post-hearing and have been resolved. Mitigation credit for these allegations is \nappropriate. \n \nOverall, Applicant\u2019s involvement in the theft scheme and debts that remained \nunresolved until after his hearing, reflect poorly on his overall financial management \ndecisions and raise significant concerns about his personal financial responsibility. I am \nnot convinced Applicant is financially responsible or makes good financial decisions. \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for criminal conduct is set out in AG \n\u00b6 30: \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case. The following is potentially applicable:  \n \n(d) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the person was formally charged, prosecuted or convicted. \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, testimony, and the documentary evidence in the record \nare sufficient to establish the disqualifying condition above. \n\n \n10 \n \nConditions that could mitigate criminal conduct security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 32. The following are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s involvement in the theft scheme spanned a considerable period of time. \nDuring that time, he chose to ignore the scheme and participated in its commission. At no \ntime did he raise his suspicions with company officials or law enforcement for fear of his \nown job and relationship with B. Despite the discovery of the scheme and his firing, he \npermitted B to move in with him and considered her his \u201ccommon law wife.\u201d Applicant\u2019s \ncriminal behavior has not been mitigated by time, circumstance, or personal actions \nshowing responsibility or rehabilitation. Despite the support of his current co-workers, he \nhas not taken full responsibility for his actions and I am not convinced that his criminal \nbehavior is behind him. No mitigation fully applies. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a), 2(c), and 2(d), the ultimate determination of whether to grant \nnational security eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Under the whole-person \nconcept, the administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d). \n \nI considered all of the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my findings of fact \nand comments under Guidelines E, F, and J, in my whole-person analysis. I also \nconsidered his military service and partial reimbursement to the company by turning over \nproperty purchased with stolen money. However, his knowing involvement in the theft \nscheme and efforts to protect himself and B have not been overcome by evidence of \nmitigation. I remain unconvinced of his financial responsibility, good judgment, and ability \nto resist further criminal activity.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s reprehensible track record and continued efforts to minimize his \ninvolvement in the criminal scheme are expressly contrary to the behavior expected of \nclearance eligible personnel. Accordingly, I conclude Applicant has not carried his burden \n\n \n11 \n \nof showing that it is clearly consistent with the national security interests of the United \nStates to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n  Subparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n  Subparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n  Subparagraphs 1.d and 1.e: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n  Subparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n  Subparagraphs 2.b \u2013 2.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline J:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n  Subparagraph 3.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.

Sykstus, Esq.   \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nLEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to revoke his eligibility for \naccess to classified information. He did not provide sufficient evidence to mitigate the \nsecurity concerns stemming from his intentional destruction of a company-owned \nexternal hard drive to which he had transferred or moved approximately 1,600 files, \nwhich included company propriety information, in advance of beginning another job in \nthe defense industry. Accordingly, this case is decided against Applicant.    \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant completed and submitted a Standard Form (SF) 86, Questionnaire for \nNational Security Positions, the official form used for personnel security investigations, \non January 22, 2016.1 This document is commonly known as a security clearance \napplication. Thereafter, on October 9, 2017, after reviewing the application and the \ninformation gathered during a background investigation, the Department of Defense \n1 Exhibit 1. \n04/12/2019\n\n \n2 \n \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility, Fort Meade, Maryland, sent Applicant a statement \nof reasons (SOR), explaining it was unable to find that it was clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. The SOR is \nsimilar to a complaint. It detailed the factual reasons for the action under the security \nguidelines known as Guideline K for handling protected information, Guideline M for use \nof information technology, and Guideline E for personal conduct. Although the SOR \nalleged three security guidelines, the factual allegations at issue are set forth in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a and 1.b and then simply cross-alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 3.a.2  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on October 26, 2017, in a four-page memorandum. \nHis answers were mixed and included detailed explanations. He also requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge.  \n \nThe case was assigned to me on November 17, 2017. The hearing did not take \nplace as scheduled on January 25, 2018, due to a government shutdown. The hearing \ntook place as rescheduled on April 20, 2018. Applicant appeared with counsel. \nDepartment Counsel offered documentary exhibits, which were admitted as Exhibits 1 \nand 2, and called no witnesses. Applicant offered documentary exhibits, which were \nadmitted as Exhibits A - LL, and called eight witnesses in addition to his own testimony. \nThe hearing transcript (Tr.) was received on May 8, 2018.  \n \nRuling on Evidence \n \nBoth of Department Counsel\u2019s exhibits, Exhibits 1 and 2, were admitted without \nobjections.3 Nevertheless, some commentary on Exhibit 2 is appropriate.  \n \nExhibit 2 contains records from Applicant\u2019s former employer and consists of two \nparts. The first part is three pages of human resources information reflecting dated \nentries (e.g., new hire, merit increase, change in reports, etc.) concerning Applicant\u2019s \nemployment with the company, which ended on December 18, 2015, with a \ndetermination that Applicant was ineligible for rehire due to the reasons of \n\u201cethics/HR/legal/security inv.\u201d By all appearances, the three pages constitute a business \nrecord made at or near the time of the events described and kept in the course of \nregularly conducted business activity, which would normally be admissible under the \nrules that govern these cases.4  \n \n                                                          \n2 At the start of the hearing, the parties were informed that the factual allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.c did not \nallege any independent disqualifying matters, but instead alleged a consequence or result of the conduct \nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b. Therefore, the parties were informed that I would not consider the \nallegation for disqualification purposes, but would consider it as a relevant fact in terms of assessing the \nseriousness of the underlying behavior. Neither Department Counsel nor Applicant raised an objection. \nTr. 11-12. Accordingly, SOR \u00b6 1.c is decided for Applicant on that basis.  \n \n3 Tr. 14-15.   \n \n4 See Federal Rule of Evidence 803(6). \n \n\n \n3 \n \nThe second part of Exhibit 2 is a two-page memorandum prepared by a company \nofficial located in a distant state from where Applicant lived and worked when employed \nby the company.5 The memorandum is dated January 23, 2018. It describes the \nemployer\u2019s investigation of events that occurred more than two years earlier in \nDecember 2015. In other words, it was not made at or near the time of the events \ndescribed. Given the date of the document, it is obvious that the memorandum was \nprepared for the purpose of litigation in this case, which was initially scheduled to be \nheard on January 25, 2018, two days after the date of the memorandum. The \nmemorandum is not self-authenticating, and it was not authenticated by a witness at the \nhearing.6 In addition, Applicant did not have an opportunity to cross-examine the person \nwho prepared the memorandum. Although the exhibit was admitted without objections, I \nwill weigh the January 23, 2018 memorandum in light of the matters discussed above.  \n \n  Findings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 57-year-old employee who is seeking to retain a security clearance \nin the defense industry. He also held a security clearance during previous military \nservice. He is employed as a facility clearance officer (FSO) for a company doing \nbusiness in the defense industry. He also has two part-time jobs that are not at issue in \nthis case.7 His formal education includes two associate\u2019s degrees, a bachelor\u2019s degree \nawarded in 2008, and a master\u2019s degree in business administration in 2011. His first \nmarriage ended in divorce in 1990, and he has been married to his second spouse \nsince 1990. He has eight adult children, none of whom live in his household.  \n \n Applicant comes from a military family. His father retired after 30 years of military \nservice. His wife is a retired servicemember too. Applicant served on active military duty \nfrom 1982 until he retired in 2005. He worked in the fields of law enforcement and \nsecurity services. He spent the last five years working in industrial information and \npersonnel security where he was also responsible for protecting classified information \nand equipment.8 He has a 20% disability rating from the Department of Veterans Affairs. \nHe next worked as an FSO for a company during 2005-2011. He also had about eight \nmonths as a self-employed security consultant in 2011. He began his employment as an \nFSO and the contract program security office (CPSO) for his previous employer in July \n2011. His employment ended in December 2015, the circumstances of which form the \nbasis for the SOR allegations.  \n \n                                                          \n5 Applicant testified that he was unfamiliar with the person who prepared Exhibit 2. Tr. 63-64.  \n \n6 Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.20 requires authenticating witnesses under certain circumstances, such \nas when the documentary exhibit in question was not furnished by an investigative agency pursuant to its \nresponsibilities in connection with assisting the Secretary of Defense to safeguard classified information \nwithin industry. \n \n7 Tr. 67-68.  \n \n8 Tr. 22-23.  \n \n\n \n4 \n \nApplicant has an excellent employment record and a good reputation in his line \nof work. He presented substantial documentary evidence establishing his honorable \nmilitary service, his past job performance, and training in occupational specialty.9 In \naddition, he called eight witnesses all of whom vouched for his overall professionalism, \nknowledge of the job, reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. In particular, I was \nespecially impressed by the testimony of a witness who is employed as a special agent \nworking in the field of industrial security for the Defense Security Services. The witness \ndescribed Applicant\u2019s work as a FSO as \u201cvery exceptional\u201d with a lot of knowledge and \nexpertise.10 \n \nTurning to the SOR allegations, two matters are at issue stemming from his \nemployment as an FSO, which ended in December 2015. First, the SOR alleges \nApplicant mishandled company proprietary information in 2015 when he transferred \nover 1,600 files, including company proprietary information, to a company-approved \nexternal hard drive without authorization. Second, the SOR alleges that during the \ncourse of the 2015 investigation into the above matter, he was asked to return the \nexternal hard drive in question, but intentionally returned another external hard drive, \nand he then intentionally and without authorization destroyed the external hard drive \ncontaining company proprietary information. \n \nApplicant has provided varying accounts of his involvement in the 2015 incident. \nIn his January 2016 security clearance application, he said he left his job as an FSO in \nDecember 2015 because he received notice on November 30, 2015, that the contract \nwas ending and he resigned on December 18, 2015.11 That is consistent with the layoff \nnotice his employer provided with a last day of work scheduled for February 5, 2016, \nand Applicant\u2019s December 3, 2015 letter of resignation with an effective date of \nDecember 18, 2015.12 He denied leaving the job under adverse circumstances.  \n \nBut in response to Question 27 of the application, concerning use of information \ntechnology systems, he admitted in the last seven years illegally or without \nauthorization, modifying, destroying, manipulating, or denying others access to \ninformation residing on an information technology system or attempted to do the \nsame.13 He then provided the following comments and explanation concerning his \naffirmative answer to Question 27: \n \nI will attempt to explain my answer to the question in more detail. I had \ngiven [employer] my two week notice for two reasons, one was [the] \ncontract was ending in February 2016, and two because I was offered \n                                                          \n9 Exhibits A \u2013 FF.  \n \n10 Tr. 136.  \n \n11 Exhibit 1 at 14-15.  \n \n12 Exhibits GG and HH. \n \n13 Exhibit 1 at 56.  \n \n\n \n5 \n \nanother position with another company. During that two week period, I \nwas cleaning out my files and paperwork, and also transferring some of \nmy accounts to other [company] employees who was taking over my \npositions. On Dec. 16, 2015, I was asked by [employer] to turn over the \n[external] hard drive I was downloading stuff to. I explained that the hard \ndrive had personal[ly] identifiable information (PII) on it. I turned a different \n[external] hard drive that I had in my possession and destroyed the hard \ndrive that had PII on it. I destroyed the hard drive that contained my \npersonal information because I did not want to provide my personal \ninformation to unknown personnel such as my [SF 86], a few \n\u201cprescreening questionnaires\u201d for another program, and other PII data. \nWhen asked, I explained that I knowingly provided my [employer] a \n[external hard] drive that did not have personal data and that I destroyed \n[the external hard] drive that contained PII. I was then informed that I \ndestroyed the hard drive without authorization.14 \n \nHe offered additional details about the incident in response to another question as \nfollows: \n \n[I] destroyed a company [external] hard drive [known as a] Passport that \nwas issued to me sometime in 2012. I had personal information on the \nhard drive including my social security number on documents and other \npersonal items that I did not want to leave behind at the company.15 \n \nHe further stated that he was relieved of duty with pay on December 16, 2015, and his \nlast day of work with the company was December 18, 2015.  \n \n \nApplicant addressed both SOR allegations in his written answer. He formally \ndenied the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.a. He explained that he transferred files from a \ncompany-approved laptop to a company-approved external hard drive, the purpose of \nwhich was to \u201csanitize\u201d the laptop of PII and other files he had compiled over the course \nof four years of employment with the company.16 He further explained that his actions \nwere driven by the unusual circumstance of the company layoff notice he received on \nDecember 15, 2015.   \n \n \nConcerning the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.b, Applicant admitted providing an incorrect \nexternal hard drive and intentionally destroyed the external hard drive in question. He \nexplained that he was acting in good faith to ensure that he did not improperly or \ninadvertently release PII, such as social security numbers, addresses, identifications, \netc. He denied knowing if any company proprietary information was on the destroyed \n                                                          \n14 Exhibit 1 at 56-57.  \n \n15 Exhibit 1 at 57. The parties sometimes referred to the external hard drive as a Passport during the \nhearing. I refer to Passport #1 and Passport #2 to distinguish between the two external hard drives.  \n \n16 Applicant explained that his definition of sanitize meant extracting information. Tr. 74.    \n \n\n \n6 \n \nhard drive, but said any such information was certainly backed-up on the shared drive at \nwork and easily accessible in that way.   \n \nIn his hearing testimony, Applicant described the events leading up to his \ndecision to accept a new job and give two weeks\u2019 notice to his then employer. He then \nexplained that he was confronted by a company official about downloading information \nduring a telephone call setup as a debriefing.17 He denied downloading information to a \npersonal hard drive or personal USB drives.18 He also denied downloading any \nproprietary information.19 The call ended that day on December 16, and Applicant went \nto another location to assist the work there. While there he received another call from \nthe company to inform him that he was relieved from duty, and he was instructed to turn \nover his company-owned property (e.g., badge, keys, laptop, etc.).20 He did as \ninstructed and then got into his car and went home.  \n \nApplicant destroyed a company-owned external hard drive (Passport #1) after \narriving home.21 He explained that he dismantled it with tools, put the parts in his grill, \nand burned the parts with the assistance of lighter fluid. He explained that Passport #1 \nended up at his home because he routinely carried it in a bag due to its sensitivity, and \nthe bag was in his car when he went home that day. He agreed that Passport #1 \ncontained sensitive but unclassified information. He stated that as far as he knew \nPassport #1 did not contain any company proprietary information. He stated that it did \nnot occur to him to turn in Passport #1 with the other equipment at the worksite because \nhe was surprised and in shock about being relieved from duty. Upon arriving home, he \nrealized he had Passport #1 and was concerned about it. Knowing Passport #1 \ncontained PII associated with other people, he decided to destroy the device. It did not \noccur to him at the time to call his supervisor at work and inform them about his \npossession of Passport #1. He thinks he may have called someone at work \nsubsequently and was unable to talk with anyone, but he does not remember with \ncertainty.  \n \nThe investigation by Applicant\u2019s former employer substantiated the allegations of \ndamage to the company\u2019s assets and unauthorized downloads.22 Applicant along with \nthe other employees who received layoff notices at the end of November 2015 were \nplaced on elevated computer and e-mail monitoring. In addition, a 90-day retroactive \ndownload report was generated that showed Applicant had conducted multiple \ndownloads to a \u201cpossible personal external device,\u201d since September 2015, with more \n                                                          \n17 Tr. 33-34.   \n \n18 Tr. 34.   \n \n19 Tr. 34.   \n \n20 Tr. 34-35.   \n \n21 Tr. 55-56, 68-71.   \n \n22 Exhibit 2 at 4-5 (the following five paragraphs rely on the January 23, 2018 memorandum prepared by \nApplicant\u2019s former employer).  \n \n\n \n7 \n \nthan 1,600 files being moved, to include presumed personal files and company files that \nlikely contained company proprietary information (e.g., security-related forms, \npresentations, templates, and letters). \n \nCompany investigators interviewed Applicant on Wednesday, December 16, \n2015, which was a couple of days before Applicant\u2019s final day of work on December 18. \nApplicant admitted using the external hard drive for work-related matters but not for \npersonal use. When confronted that computer data showed that personal information \nwas on the device, Applicant stated he did not know what they were talking about. \nApplicant stated that it was a company-purchased device that was given to him by \nanother employee. He also stated that he used the device for work-related tasks while \nat the site or on business travel and had done so for the last three years. Applicant \nindicated that he would turn over the device to his manager before his departure from \nthe company. He further stated that he did not have any classified or proprietary \ninformation in his possession. \n \nAfter the interview, Applicant was placed on paid administrative leave for the \nremaining two days of his two-week-notice period. Applicant turned over all assigned \ncompany assets to security, and Passport #2 was turned over to the site manager for \nreview. \n \nThe company determined that the external hard drive was only used with \nApplicant\u2019s company-issued laptop. They also determined that the contents of Passport \n#2 were different from the files displayed in the screenshots and it was not the device \nApplicant used for downloads and during the monitoring period. \n \nApplicant was contacted again concerning Passport #1. He stated that he had \ntwo Passports while at work, but he withheld this information, although he knew the \ncompany investigator wanted to obtain Passport #1. Applicant stated that he did not \nwant anyone having access to his personal information on Passport #1. He further \nstated that he brought Passport #1 to his home and destroyed it even though he knew \nthe device was company property and should have been returned to the company for \nreview. He described how he destroyed the device by dismantling it and burning the \nparts in his grill. He further stated that he did not have any classified or property \ninformation in his possession, and he apologized for deceiving the company investigator \nduring the interview. The memorandum ends by noting that Applicant resigned in lieu of \ntermination on December 18, 2015.  \n \nBased on the matters set forth above, I hereby make the specific findings of fact: \n \n1. Applicant mishandled company proprietary information in 2015 by \ntransferring or downloading more than 1,600 files, including company \npropriety information, to a company-approved external hard drive \n(Passport #1) without authorization. \n \n2. Applicant was asked to return the external hard drive (Passport #1) \ncontaining the company proprietary information during the 2015 \n\n \n8 \n \ncompany investigation, but he instead returned another external hard \ndrive (Passport #2) while at the same time retaining and destroying the \nsought-after device (Passport #1). Destruction of the device was \nintentional and without authorization from his then employer. \n \nLaw and Policies \n \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017.23 \n \nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.24 As \nnoted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent \nstandard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the \nside of denials.\u201d25 Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt \nabout whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be \nresolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that \nthe burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.26 The Appeal Board has \nfollowed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed under the \nsubstantial-evidence standard.27 \n \n \nA favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted \na security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.28 An \nunfavorable clearance decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing \nsecurity clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.29 \n \n \nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for \naccess to classified information.30 The Government has the burden of presenting \n                                                          \n23 The 2017 AG are available at http://ogc.osd.mil/doha.  \n \n24 Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \n\u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10th Cir. 2002) (no \nright to a security clearance).  \n \n25 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n26 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n27 ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).  \n \n28 Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n \n29 Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n \n30 ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004). \n\n \n9 \n \nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.31 An \napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate \nfacts that have been admitted or proven.32 In addition, an applicant has the ultimate \nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.33 \n \nDiscussion \n \n \nAlthough the SOR alleges three different security guidelines, Guidelines K, M, \nand E, they rely on the same set of facts and circumstances as set forth in the initial \nparagraphs of the SOR at \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b. Given these circumstances, these matters will \nbe addressed together, because the overall decision is an evaluation of Applicant\u2019s \ntrustworthiness, judgment, reliability, and willingness and ability to safeguard protect \nclassified or sensitive information, which are central matters for consideration under all \nthree security guidelines. \n \n \nUnder Guidelines K, M, and E, I have considered the following disqualifying \nconditions as most pertinent to the facts and circumstances of this case: AG \u00b6\u00b6 34(b) \nand (g), AG \u00b6\u00b6 40(b) and (d), and AG \u00b6 17(c). Likewise, under Guidelines K, M, and E, I \nhave considered the following mitigating conditions as most pertinent to the facts and \ncircumstances of this case: AG \u00b6 35(a), AG \u00b6 41(a), and AG \u00b6 17(c). Having considered \nthe totality of facts and circumstances in light of the pertinent disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions, I conclude that Applicant did not provide sufficient evidence to \nmitigate the security concerns stemming from his intentional destruction of a company-\nowned external hard drive to which he had transferred or moved approximately 1,600 \nfiles, which included company propriety information, from his company-owned laptop in \nadvance of beginning another job in the defense industry. The sheer number of \ndownloaded files, reported to be more than 1,600, supports a conclusion Applicant was \ntransferring more than personal files. \n \n \nMy main concerns and doubts in this case are twofold. First, Applicant gave \nvarying accounts of his involvement in the 2015 incident. Taken as a whole, his \naccounts are at variance in important respects with his former employer\u2019s account of the \n2015 investigation as set forth in the January 2018 memorandum. For example, \naccording to the January 2018 memorandum, Applicant admitted that he purposely \nprovided Passport #2 instead of Passport #1 to company officials. He said essentially \nthe same thing in his January 2016 security clearance application, as quoted in the \nfindings of fact. But in his hearing testimony he attributed his retention of Passport #1 to \noversight during the unexpected circumstance of being relieved from duty on December \n                                                          \n31 Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14. \n \n32 Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15. \n \n33 Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.  \n \n\n \n10 \n \n16. Given the varying accounts, I am uncertain if Applicant is giving full, frank, and \ntruthful answers about his involvement in this matter.34  \n \n \nSecond, Applicant did not conduct himself as an honest person on December 16 \nknowing that he still had Passport #1. An honest person would have made a reasonable \neffort to return Passport #1 to his employer. Return of the device could have been \naccomplished by a telephone call or e-mail to his supervisor or some other company \nofficial; getting in the car and returning the device to his employer\u2019s worksite; or by \nmailing or delivery of the device to the employer along with an explanatory note. \nApplicant thinks he may have made a phone call without success, but his recollection is \nuncertain. Further, an honest person would not have rushed to destroy Passport #1 on \nthe same day he was placed on administrative leave, knowing that it was likely the \ncompany would be looking for it. Other than a single phone call, he did none of things \nan honest person would have done if they had inadvertently or mistakenly retained \nPassport #1. Instead, Applicant destroyed Passport #1 by dismantling it with tools and \nburning the parts in his grill. Such conduct is suspicious and suggests he was trying to \nhide or conceal adverse information. Given these circumstances, I view Applicant\u2019s \ntransgressions as reflected herein to be serious misconduct.  \n \n \nFollowing Egan and the clearly consistent standard, I have doubts and concerns \nabout Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence \nas a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable \nevidence or vice versa. I also considered the whole-person concept. In doing so, I \nconsidered Applicant\u2019s 23-plus years of honorable military service, his years of holding \na security clearance in the military and while working in the defense industry, his \nexcellent employment record, his formal education, his wealth of training in his \noccupational speciality, and the highly favorable testimony of the eight witnesses. \nNevertheless, his favorable evidence does not outweigh the seriousness of his \nmisconduct. Accordingly, I conclude that he did not meet his ultimate burden of \npersuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him \neligibility for access to classified information.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline K:  \n \nAgainst Applicant  \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline M:  \n \nAgainst Applicant  \n \n                                                          \n34 Directive, \u00b6 6.2 (\u201cAn applicant is required to give . . . full, frank, and truthful answers to relevant and \nmaterial questions needed by DOHA to reach a clearance decision and to otherwise comply with the \nprocedures authorized by this Directive.\u201d).   \n\n \n11 \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:  \n \nAgainst Applicant  \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant access to \nclassified information.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted to the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, and 1.d,~1.f. He denied SOR allegation \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, 1.g, and 1.h After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 50-year-old employee of a defense contractor. (GX 1 at pages 5 and 9.) He has been employed with the defense contractor since April of 2016. (GX 1 at page 9.) He is \u201cseparated\u201d from his spouse; and has three son\u2019s ages \u201c20, 12 and 10,\u201d The two youngest live with Applicant. (TR at page 18 line 16 to page 24 line 3, and GX 1 at page 14.) Applicant served in the U.S. Navy for \u201c16 or 17 years,\u201d but family concerns and a personnel \u201cdraw down\u201d caused Applicant to leave active duty. (TR at page 18 line 16 to page 24 line 3.) Guideline F \u2013 Financial Considerations 1.a. Applicant admits that he is indebted to Creditor A for a past-due debt of about $544. He has engaged the services of a debt counseling service; and through that service, he is making monthly payments of $197 towards this and his other past- due debts. (TR at page 24 line 8 to page 25 line 11, at page 33 line 3 to page 35 line 16, AppX C, and AppX D at page 1.) 1.b. Applicant denies that he is indebted to Creditor B for a past-due debt of about $250.

The SOR further informed \nApplicant that, based on information available to the government, DoD adjudicators \ncould not make the preliminary affirmative finding it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on October 17, 2017, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. (Answer.) The case was assigned to me on January 22, \n2018. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing \non January 24, 2018, scheduling the hearing for February 15, 2018. The hearing was \nconvened as scheduled. The Government offered Exhibits (GXs) 1 through 5, which \nwere admitted into evidence. Applicant testified on his own behalf. Applicant presented \nthree sets of documents; which I marked Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AppXs) A through C, and \nadmitted into evidence. The record was left open until April 16, 2018, for receipt of \n\n \n2 \n \nadditional documentation. On April 15, 2018, Applicant presented another set of \ndocuments; which I marked AppX D, and admitted into evidence. DOHA received the \ntranscript of the hearing (TR) on February 26, 2018. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted to the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, and 1.d,~1.f. He denied \nSOR allegation \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, 1.g, and 1.h After a thorough and careful review of the \npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 50-year-old employee of a defense contractor. (GX 1 at pages 5 \nand 9.) He has been employed with the defense contractor since April of 2016. (GX 1 at \npage 9.) He is \u201cseparated\u201d from his spouse; and has three son\u2019s ages \u201c20, 12 and 10,\u201d \nThe two youngest live with Applicant. (TR at page 18 line 16 to page 24 line 3, and GX \n1 at page 14.) Applicant served in the U.S. Navy for \u201c16 or 17 years,\u201d but family \nconcerns and a personnel \u201cdraw down\u201d caused Applicant to leave active duty. (TR at \npage 18 line 16 to page 24 line 3.) \n \nGuideline F \u2013 Financial Considerations \n \n \n1.a. Applicant admits that he is indebted to Creditor A for a past-due debt of \nabout $544. He has engaged the services of a debt counseling service; and through \nthat service, he is making monthly payments of $197 towards this and his other past-\ndue debts. (TR at page 24 line 8 to page 25 line 11, at page 33 line 3 to page 35 line 16,  \nAppX C, and AppX D at page 1.) \n \n \n1.b. Applicant denies that he is indebted to Creditor B for a past-due debt of \nabout $250. He believes this debt is actually owed by his eldest son; but in an \nabundance of caution, he is making monthly payments of $197 towards this debt and \nhis other past-due debts. (TR at page 25 line 13 to page 26 line 18, at page 35 line 17 \nto page 36 line 10, and AppX D at page 1.) \n \n \n1.c. Applicant denies that he is indebted to Creditor C for a past-due debt of \nabout $60. He has \u201cno idea what this is\u201d; but in an abundance of caution, he is making \nmonthly payments of $197 towards this debt and his other past-due debts. (TR at page \n26 line 20 to page 27 line 3, at page 36 lines 11~15, and AppX D at page 1.) \n \n \n1.d. Applicant admits that he owed the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) a past-\ndue tax lien in the amended amount of $290. (TR at page 27 line 24 to page 32 line 18, \nat page 36 line 17 to page 37 line 12, and AppX D at pages 2~3.) He has been in \ncontact with the IRS (AppX B); and has \u201cPAID\u201d the amended amount, as evidenced by \ndocumentation from the IRS (AppX D at pages 2~3). \n \n \n1.e. Applicant admits that he owed the IRS a second past-due tax lien in the \noriginal amount of $16,928. (TR at page 27 line 24 to page 32 line 18, at page 36 line \n17 to page 37 line 12, and AppX D at pages 2~3.) He has been in contact with the IRS \n\n \n3 \n \n(AppX B); and the amount owed has yet to be determined, as evidenced by \ndocumentation from the IRS (AppX D at pages 2~3). \n \n \n1.f. Applicant admits that he owed IRS a third past-due tax lien in the amended \namount of $364. (TR at page 27 line 24 to page 32 line 18, at page 36 line 17 to page \n37 line 12, and AppX D at pages 2~3.) He has been in contact with the IRS (AppX B); \nand has \u201cPAID\u201d the amended amount, as evidenced by documentation from the IRS \n(AppX D at pages 2~3). \n \n \n1.g. Applicant denies that he is indebted to Creditor G for a past-due debt of \nabout $53. He does not \u201crecall owing them anything\u201d; but in an abundance of caution, \nhe is making monthly payments of $197 towards this debt and his other past-due debts. \n(TR at page 27 lines 4~20, at page 37 lines 15~24, and AppX D at page 1.) \n \n \n1.h. Applicant denies that he is indebted to Creditor H for a past-due debt of \nabout $270. He does not recall owing them anything; but in an abundance of caution, he \nis making monthly payments of $197 towards this debt and his other past-due debts. \n(TR at page 27 lines 21~23, at page 37 lines 15~24, and AppX D at page 1.) \n \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative \njudge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \nnational security eligibility. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n\n \n4 \n \n \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall \nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n  \nApplicant has significant past-due debt, and owes back Federal taxes. The \nevidence is sufficient to raise these disqualifying conditions.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 including: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nThrough a debt counseling service, Applicant is addressing his past-due debts. \nHe is also in contact with the IRS; has paid two of the tax delinquencies, and is \naddressing the third.  Guideline F is found for Applicant. \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n\n \n6 \n \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Overall, the record evidence leaves me \nwithout questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the Financial \nConsiderations security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a~h: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \nRichard A. Cefola \nAdministrative Judge \n",

She requires access to sensitive personal information in connection with her employment. (Government Exhibit 1 at Sections 12, 13A, and 17.) The SOR contained 12 allegations under Guideline F, Financial Considerations. The allegations relate to unfiled tax returns (1.a), delinquent student loans (1.b) and consumer debts (1.c through 1.l). Applicant admitted all the allegations in the SOR under this paragraph. Evidence for the existence of the debts set forth in the SOR is found in credit reports of Applicant dated November 21, 2015; August 24, 2017; and November 13, 2017.

Applicant graduated from college in 2009. About that time she developed severe and continuing health problems that affected her ability to work and make a livable wage. Due to her medical issues Applicant was either unemployed or underemployed for several years.

On September 15, 2017, the Department of Defense \n(DoD) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing trustworthiness \nconcerns under Guidelines F, Financial Considerations and E, Personal Conduct. The \naction was taken under DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DoD on June 18, 2017.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing (Answer) on October 16, 2017, and \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel was prepared \nto proceed on November 13, 2017. The case was assigned to another administrative \njudge on July 10, 2018. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nNotice of Hearing on July 11, 2018. The case was re-assigned to me on July 12, 2018. I \nconvened the hearing as scheduled on August 21, 2018. The Government offered \nGovernment Exhibits 1 through 5, which were admitted without objection. Applicant \ntestified on her own behalf, called two additional witnesses, and submitted Applicant \n\n \n2 \n \n \nExhibits A and B, which were also admitted without objection. DOHA received the \ntranscript of the hearing (Tr.) on August 31, 2018. The record was left open at the \nrequest of Applicant until September 17, 2018, for the receipt of additional \ndocumentation. Applicant submitted additional information that was marked as Applicant \nExhibits C through I and admitted without objection. The record then closed.     \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is 66 years old and married. She has a Bachelor\u2019s degree. Applicant \nbegan work with her current employer in December 2015. She requires access to \nsensitive personal information in connection with her employment. (Government Exhibit \n1 at Sections 12, 13A, and 17.) \n \n \nThe SOR contained 12 allegations under Guideline F, Financial Considerations. \nThe allegations relate to unfiled tax returns (1.a), delinquent student loans (1.b) and \nconsumer debts (1.c through 1.l). Applicant admitted all the allegations in the SOR \nunder this paragraph. \n \n \nEvidence for the existence of the debts set forth in the SOR is found in credit \nreports of Applicant dated November 21, 2015; August 24, 2017; and November 13, \n2017. (Government Exhibits 3, 4, and 5.) The total amount of past-due indebtedness \nowed by Applicant is alleged to be approximately $11,895. Past-due student loans \naccount for $3,470 of the delinquencies. \n \n \nApplicant graduated from college in 2009. About that time she developed severe \nand continuing health problems that affected her ability to work and make a livable \nwage.  Due to her medical issues Applicant was either unemployed or underemployed \nfor several years.  \n \n \nApplicant was not making a livable wage until she obtained employment with a \ndefense contractor beginning in December 2015. Between 2009 and 2015 Applicant\u2019s \nannual income ranged from a low of $4,427 to a high $18,245 as shown on her tax \nreturns. Only after Applicant began current employment did she begin to make sufficient \nmoney to live, earning $36,378 in 2017. (Applicant Exhibits H and I; Tr. 19-21, 23.) \n \n \nBecause Applicant was disabled she became a client of her state\u2019s Department \nof Rehabilitation (DOR) starting in 2009. Her counselor from that time until about 2016 \ntestified, \u201cWe are a state agency that works with people with disabilities to help them \nbecome successfully employed and reach a more independent life.\u201d It was after several \nyears of work with her counselor that Applicant was hired by a defense contractor that \nplaces people with disabilities with a Department of Defense entity. (Tr. 39-41.)  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nParagraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations) \n \n \n1.a. Due to Applicant\u2019s disability affecting her memory, and the financial issues \nbrought about by her unemployment and underemployment, she was unable to file her \ntax returns for several years. Because she was working with the Defense Department \nApplicant became eligible to use her employing agency\u2019s Volunteer Income Tax \nAssistance (VITA) coordinator. Working with the coordinator Applicant was able to \nprepare and submit all of her past-due tax returns. She is now current with her tax \nfilings. Since filing her tax returns, Applicant has been in continual communication with \nthe IRS and has entered into a payment arrangement for her past-due taxes. She made \nthe first payment required under the agreement, as shown by documentation she \nprovided. Given her current financial situation, Applicant intends to continue to pay off \nthe IRS through installment payments before moving on to her delinquent consumer \ndebts. (Applicant Exhibits C, H, and I; Tr. 22-23, 32-33, 45-46, 49.) \n \n \n1.b. Applicant admitted owing past-due student loans. She has been in continual \ncontact with the creditor on her student loans. Applicant has been in forbearance for \nseveral years because of her lack of income. Applicant made a payment arrangement \nwith the student loan creditor and has been making consistent payments in accordance \nwith that arrangement since February 2018. She has the payments for this creditor \ntaken directly out of her bank account. (Applicant Exhibits B and F; Tr. 23, 28-29, 33-34, \n50-51.)  \n \n \n1.c through 1.l. Applicant admitted that she owed these past-due debts and did \nnot have the ability to pay them at the time of the hearing, given her current payments \nfor back taxes and student loans. These debts are from the time before she obtained a \njob with the Defense Department. They consist mainly of medical debts and everyday \nexpenses. Two members of the DOR who worked with Applicant testified that these \nkind of debt problems are often seen in people they work with, due to the nature of the \nperson\u2019s disability and inability to obtain and retain a job. Applicant has entered \ndiscussions with her credit union to find ways to pay these debts off in a measured way. \nHer DOR counselors are assisting Applicant in these endeavors as part of their duties, \nwhich is to make sure their clients remain employed. (Applicant Exhibit G; Tr. 29-30, 42-\n44, 47-48, 51.) \n \nParagraph 2 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct) \n \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for \nclearance because she has engaged in conduct that shows poor judgment, \nuntrustworthiness or unreliability. Applicant denied the single allegation under this \nguideline.  \n \n \nApplicant filled out her e-QIP on October 15, 2015. Section 26 of that \nquestionnaire concerns Applicant\u2019s financial situation. Two subsections ask whether, \nwithin seven years of filling out the questionnaire, Applicant had debts turned over to a \ncollection agency; or had an account suspended, charged off, or cancelled for failing to \n\n \n4 \n \n \npay as agreed. Applicant answered both questions, \u201cNo.\u201d As stated, Applicant had past-\ndue debts, so this was a false answer to a relevant question about her financial \nsituation. (Government Exhibit 1.) \n \n \nAnother subsection of Section 26 concerns Applicant\u2019s taxes. In that subsection \nApplicant fully informed the government of the situation concerning her unfiled and \nunpaid taxes from 2009 through 2014, as of the date of the questionnaire. (Government \nExhibit 1.) \n \n \nApplicant has consistently stated that she did not list her debts because she did \nnot remember them. In her Answer she stated, \u201cAt the time, I did not realize the \naccumulation of debts. Otherwise, I would have said yes.\u201d In addition, when questioned \nby an investigator with the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) in 2017, she fully \ndiscussed her taxes and debts. However, her memory was bad on the extent of her \ndebt situation. She testified that the memory issues she had been suffering for several \nyears also had an impact on her ability to remember her debts when filling out the \nquestionnaire. Applicant\u2019s testimony was credible. (Government Exhibit 2; Tr. 30-32, 52-\n55.) \n \nMitigation \n \n \nA coworker of Applicant, who is also the VITA coordinator, submitted a statement \non Applicant\u2019s behalf. She stated that Applicant has shown \u201cexemplary professional \ncharacter in the work she performs with her peer government staff.\u201d (Applicant Exhibit \nD.) \n \n \nAs stated, two staff members of DOR, who have worked with Applicant, also \ntestified. These people, who have known Applicant for some time, find her to be \nbelievable, truthful, honest, and trustworthy. (Applicant Exhibit E; Tr. 37-49.) \n \n \nPolicies \n \nPositions designated as ADP I/II/III are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d The \nDeputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence and Security) Memorandum, \ndated November 19, 2004, indicates trustworthiness adjudications will apply to cases \nforwarded to the DoD and DOHA by the Defense Security Service and Office of \nPersonnel Management. DoD contractor personnel are afforded the right to the \nprocedures contained in the Directive before any final unfavorable access determination \nmay be made.  \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility for a \npublic trust position, the administrative judge must consider the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions in the AGs. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. \nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied \nin conjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(d), describing the adjudicative process. \n\n \n5 \n \n \nThe administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable national \nsecurity eligibility decision. \n \n \nA person who applies for access to sensitive information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nsensitive information.  \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nParagraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations) \n \n \nThe trustworthiness concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations \nare set out in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part:  \n    \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personal security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \n\n \n6 \n \n \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19 describes three conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns and \nmay be disqualifying in this case:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \n \nApplicant has a history of being unable to fully satisfy all of her debts, ten of \nwhich remain unresolved and delinquent. She also did not file her tax returns for several \nyears. The evidence raises all three trustworthiness concerns, thereby shifting the \nburden to Applicant to rebut, extenuate, or mitigate those concerns.  \n \n \nThe guideline includes five conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate \ntrustworthiness concerns arising from Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \nThe evidence supports application of all of these mitigating conditions in this \ncase. All of the financial issues in this case, including Applicant\u2019s unfiled taxes, were \nprimarily due to her physical and mental health issues. These issues resulted in her \nbecoming a client of her state\u2019s DOR, which worked diligently with a defense contractor \nwho deals with people with disabilities, to place Applicant with a Defense agency. \nApplicant has been employed full-time since December 2015, and for the first time in \nmany years she is making a livable wage. Applicant has begun resolving her student \nloans. She has also filed all her tax returns and made a workable payment arrangement \nwith the IRS. She still has past-due debts, but credibly stated that she intends to pay \nthem as she has funds available. The DOR continues to work with Applicant to assure \nthat these financial issues are resolved. The DOHA Appeal Board has stated, \u201cAn \napplicant is not required to show that she has completely paid off her indebtedness, \nonly that she has established a reasonable plan to resolve her debts and has taken \nsignificant actions to implement that plan.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 06-12930 at 2 (App. Bd. \nMar. 17, 2008) (quoting ISCR Case No. 04-09684 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jul. 6, 2006)). AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n(a), (b), (c), and (d) apply. \n \n \nTurning to her tax returns, I find that AG \u00b6 20(g) applies to this case as well. \nFailure to file or pay taxes can be viewed as a serious problem that strongly favors \ndenial of national security eligibility. However, the mitigating condition exists for \nsituations such as this. The evidence clearly shows that Applicant\u2019s failure to file her tax \nreturns was not willful. In other words, she did not intentionally fail to file them. Rather, \nas became obvious during the hearing, she was incapable of filing those returns due to \nher disabilities. It was only after working for the Defense Department, and having \naccess to VITA, that she was able to get the help she needed to file them. Under the \nparticular circumstances of this case, and viewing the evidence as a whole, I find \nApplicant has mitigated this allegation as well. Paragraph 1 is found for Applicant.  \n \nParagraph 2 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct) \n \nThe security concerns pertaining to the personal conduct guideline are set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \n \nThe Government alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.a that Applicant falsified the e-QIP that she \nfilled out on October 15, 2015, by not admitting that she had delinquent debts. I find that \nApplicant did not intend to falsify this questionnaire. I make this finding based on three \nfactors. First, Applicant was fully forthcoming in the questionnaire about her tax status. \nFreely admitting other adverse information shows that Applicant lacked the requisite \nintent to falsify this financial information on the questionnaire. \n\n \n8 \n \n \nSecond, Applicant freely and openly discussed her debt situation with an \ninvestigator from OPM. In fact, it is telling and supports the statements about her \nmemory situation that Applicant needed to be reminded by the investigator of her debts. \n \nThird and finally, Applicant\u2019s testimony was subject to cross-examination by \nDepartment Counsel. Her testimony was credible on this point, particularly the memory \nissues and inability to recall the debts at the time she completed her e-QIP. \n \n \nBased on my finding that Applicant did not falsify her questionnaire, none of the \ndisqualifying or general Personal Conduct guideline concerns apply to Applicant\u2019s \nconduct. Paragraph 2 is found for Applicant. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national \nsecurity eligibility for a trustworthiness determination must be an overall commonsense \njudgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person \nconcept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant submitted sufficient \ninformation from which to conclude that her financial obligations are being responsibly \nmanaged and that similar problems are unlikely to recur. She has overcome her \ndisabilities with the help of her state DOR. She is now gainfully employed by the \nDefense contractor and in a position to continue resolving her debts. She did not \ndeliberately falsify her questionnaire. Overall, the record evidence leaves me without \nquestions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a public trust position. \nFor these reasons, I conclude Applicant met her burden to mitigate the trustworthiness \nconcerns arising from her financial problems and alleged personal conduct. \n \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n            \nSubparagraph 1.a through 1.l: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant  \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a public trust position. Eligibility for access to sensitive ADP information is granted. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nWILFORD H.

(See Stein, Administrative Law, Section 25.01 (Bender & Co. 2006) (listing \nfifteen types of facts for administrative notice)) \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, she admitted one of the allegations, with \nexplanations (SOR 2.a). She denied the remaining two allegations (SOR 1.a and 2.b). \nHer admission is incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful \nreview of the evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 61 years old. She has worked for her current federal contractor-\nemployer for approximately 20 years, on and off. She is a software development project \nmanager. She holds bachelor\u2019s and MBA degrees. She is a native-born U.S. citizen and \nhas always resided in this country. She has lived in her current location for over 30 \nyears. She has been married over 30 years and has two adult sons. She previously held \na public trust position when she worked for another government agency. (Tr. at 26-27, \n30-31, 33; GE 1.) \n \n \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant\u2019s former employment as the vice president of \ngovernment sector systems engineering with Company 1 (C1), a company with ties to \nRussian intelligence and the Russian government, created a conflict of interest and a \nheightened risk of exploitation (SOR 1.a); the SOR also alleged that Applicant \nmaintained her employment with C1 from March 2014 through January 2015 despite \nknowing that C1 may be affiliated with the Russian government or Russian intelligence, \nand that her former employment with C1 creates an ongoing potential for a conflict of \ninterest and could create an increased security risk (SOR 2.a-2.b).  \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nSometime before March 2014, a former coworker of Applicant\u2019s reached out to \nher to see if she would be interested in a position with a new company (C1) for which he \nwas the general manager. Applicant understood C1 to be a services company, which \n\u201csold\u201d its customers consulting support. C1 was a registered U.S. company. Its parent \ncompany was C2 and was also a U.S. registered company. C2\u2019s parent company was \nC3, which was identified as a Russian company. C2 and C3 were software sales \ncompanies. C1 did not sell software. Applicant accepted the position and was hired in \nMarch 2014 as the Vice President, Government Sector Systems Engineering. Her \nsalary was approximately $165,000 per year, up from approximately $135,000 that she \nearned from her last employer. Since C1 was a brand new company with no existing \nclientele, the first several months of the job entailed Applicant setting up and organizing \nthe office. At the time, C1 had a total of four employees: the general manager, \nApplicant, another vice president who served as the general manager\u2019s deputy, and an \noffice manager who had the title of operations manager. (Tr. at 37-40, 42; Ans.; GE 2; \nAE A) \n \n \nApplicant credibly testified that while she worked for C1 it was unable to secure \nany contracts. She believed that C1 was funded by C2 or C3 during this time, although \nshe had no personal involvement with C2 or C3. Her general manager required \nApplicant to attend C3\u2019s annual meeting in June 2014, which was held in Russia. \nApplicant was there to attend events, she was not a presenter or speaker. Her general \nmanager made presentations at some seminars. She did not make any acquaintances \nat this meeting. Applicant became concerned about working for C1 when her general \nmanager told her of an encounter he had during the Russia meeting. The general \nmanager stated that he was invited into the office of someone and noticed a uniform on \ndisplay. He recognized it as a possible former KGB (former Soviet secret intelligence \nservice) uniform. In July 2014 when Applicant got back to the United States and thought \nabout this disclosure by her general manager, she decided to quit working for C1. She \ndid not actually quit the job until December 2014 and stopped being paid in January \n2015. She explained this delay was because she was also teaching as an adjunct \nprofessor at a local university at the time, which did not allow her time to search for a \nnew job. She was advised early on in her working career to never quit a job until she \nhad another job lined up. Her family circumstances at the time were that she was paying \nfor her two son\u2019s college tuitions and her health insurance was through C1. She was \nable to secure follow-on employment in February 2015. Shortly after she left the \ncompany, the general manager was let go from his position and C1 stopped doing \nbusiness. (Tr. at 43-49, 56-59, 73-74; Ans.; GE 2)    \n \n \nIn October 2014, while still employed by C1, Applicant attended a government \ncybersecurity forum in the United States. She participated as a panelist. The founder \nand CEO of C3 authored the written welcome page to the forum\u2019s written materials, but \nhe was not in attendance. The forum was attended by current and former U.S. \ngovernment officials. (Tr. at 69-70; GE 3)  \n \n \n \nIn September 2017, The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) issued a \nbinding operational directive (BOD), applicable to all federal agencies, to remove and \n\n \n4 \n \n \ndiscontinue use of any products associated with C1, C2, and C3 because of the risk \nthose products create to federal information and information systems. (See 44 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n3552(b)) This BOD became a final decision in December 2017. Applicant quit working \nfor C1 approximately two and a half years before the issuance of the BOD. Except when \nthe operations manager called Applicant in February 2015 to tell her she was leaving \nC1, Applicant has had no contact with C1, C2, or C3, or its former employees since she \nquit. She has no family or friends in Russia. She has never had any contacts with any \nmember of the Russian government. Her only trip to Russia was in June 2014 while \nworking for C1. (Tr. at 63, 72, 74, 79; GE 6-10; AE K)  \n \n \nApplicant admitted her employment with C1 when completing her trustworthiness \napplication and during her interview with a defense investigator. She lists this \nemployment on her resume and on her employment-related social media page. She has \nnever attempted to conceal her employment with C1 from the government. (Tr. at 29, \n83; AE 1-2, 4) \n \n \nApplicant documented her financial and community ties to the United States. Her \nhome value is approximately $385,000, with approximately $102,000 worth of equity. \nHer U.S. investments and insurance total approximately $583,000. She is an active \nmember in her local church, sings in a community choir, participates in Habitat for \nHumanity events, donates blood to the Red Cross, and volunteered to help at a local \nshelter. She is a registered voter in her home state and has exercised her right to vote \non a regular basis. (Tr. at 76-78, 80-81; AE E-J, S-Y) \n \nCharacter Evidence. \n \n \nApplicant presented the testimony of three character witnesses. Witness one \n(W1) is Applicant\u2019s sister-in-law and has known her for 40 years. W1 also worked for a \ngovernment agency for 39 years as a senior executive and held a top secret clearance \nwith sensitive access. Her background and experience has given her specialized insight \nto foreign companies trying to exploit U.S. companies for sensitive information. She is \nalso aware of the allegations in Applicant\u2019s SOR. She was aware of Applicant\u2019s \nemployed with C1 in 2014 and became aware of Applicant\u2019s disillusionment with her \nemployment after returning from Russia. Applicant\u2019s values were not the same as those \nheld by C1. W1 has not witnessed or been apprised of any follow-on contacts between \nApplicant and C1, C2, or C3. W1 believes Applicant has strong loyalties to the United \nStates and would trust her with sensitive or classified information. W1 also provided a \nsworn affidavit (Tr. at 116-125; AE BB) \n \n \nWitness two (W2) currently works with Applicant. He is the lead security person \non the DOD contract for his employer and has worked industrial security issues for 15 \nyears. He has also served as the facilities security officer (FSO). Part of his duties \nincluded overseeing the company\u2019s insider threat program. He has held a security \nclearance for 17 years. He also worked for the U.S. Secret Service for two years. \nApplicant has always completed her security training on time. Applicant \u201ccomplies with \nour security program and company security rules and has never been the cause of any \n\n \n5 \n \n \nsecurity problems.\u201d Applicant has never demonstrated any behavior that would lead W2 \nto question her personal integrity or loyalty to this country. W2 also supplied a sworn \naffidavit. (Tr. at 128-134; AE AA) \n \n \nWitness three (W3) has known Applicant for 30 years and is a close personal \nfriend. W3 is an in-house legal counsel to a defense contractor and holds a security \nclearance. She is aware of the allegations in Applicant\u2019s SOR. Applicant has never \nshared any work-related sensitive information with W3. Applicant is unquestionably \ntrustworthy and does what is right. W3 also supplied a sworn affidavit. (Tr. at 136-143; \nAE R)  \n \n \nApplicant also provided the sworn affidavits of 19 other persons who are (or \nwere) coworkers and friends. All universally opined that she is reliable, responsible, and \ntrustworthy. (AE N-Q, CC-QQ) \n \nAdministrative Notice-Russia. \n \n \nRussia has a highly centralized, weak multi-party political system dominated by \nthe president. Russia has significant human-rights problems, marked by restrictions on \ncivil liberties, discrimination, denial of due process, forced confessions, torture, other \nprisoner mistreatment, and the government\u2019s failure to prosecute officials who commit \nserious violations. Government officials also engage in electronic surveillance without \nproper authorization. \n \n \nRussia is one of the most aggressive countries conducting espionage against the \nUnited States, focusing on obtaining proprietary information and advance weapons \ntechnologies beneficial to Russia\u2019s military modernization and economic development. \nRussia\u2019s intelligence services as well as private companies and other entities frequently \nseek to exploit Russian citizens or persons with family ties to Russia who can use their \ninsider access to corporate networks to steal secrets. They also have offered financial \ninducements to U.S. government officials and citizens to encourage them to \ncompromise classified information. Russia\u2019s attempts to collect U.S. technological and \neconomic information represent a growing and persistent threat to U.S. security. (HE II) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial and commonsense decision. According to AG 2(a), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable trustworthiness \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nsensitive information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n  \nAG 6 explains the trustworthiness concern about \u201cforeign contacts and interests\u201d \nas follows:  \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \n\n \n7 \n \n \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nAG 7 indicates conditions that could raise a trustworthiness concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology.  \nApplicant was hired by C1 in 2014 and worked for it for approximately 11 months. \nShe quit in January 2015. In September 2017, C1 (along with its parent companies C2 \nand C3) was a subject of BOD 17-01, which required all U.S. government agencies to \nrid themselves of any products or services rendered by these companies. The BOD was \nissued because of the companies\u2019 possible affiliation with Russia and Russian \nintelligence services. Applicant has no further ties to C1 (and never had any direct ties \nto C2, or C3), has no family, friends, or other contacts with Russia or the Russian \ngovernment. The Government failed to establish an existing connection between \nApplicant and any Russian interest. AG 7(a) and 7(b) have not been established by \nsubstantial evidence.  \n \nAlthough my findings lead to the conclusion that the foreign influence concerns \nwere not established, I also find that the evidence would support the application of \nmitigating conditions to Applicant\u2019s case.  \n \nAG 8 lists conditions that could mitigate foreign influence trustworthiness \nconcerns, including:  \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.; and \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \n\n \n8 \n \n \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest.  \n \nApplicant credibly testified that she had no contact with any Russian entity and \nquit working for C1 in 2015, long before the BOD was even issued. She presented \nsufficient evidence to establish that it is unlikely that she would be placed in a position to \nchoose between the interest of Russia and those of the United States. She has no \nconnection to Russia or the Russian government. AG \u00b6 8(a) applies. \n \nApplicant has met his burden to establish her \u201cdeep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S.\u201d She is a native-born citizen, has resided her \nwhole life in the United States, and has family, community and financial interests only in \nthe United States. There is no evidence on any interests in Russia. Friends and co-\nworkers attest to her loyalty, dedication, and overall trustworthiness. The evidence \nsupports that Applicant has longstanding ties to the United States and would resolve \nany conflict of interest in favor of the United States. AG \u00b6 8(b) applies. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG 15 expresses the personal conduct trustworthiness concern: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . . \n \nAG 16 describes conditions that could raise a trustworthiness concern and may \nbe disqualifying in this case. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially \napplicable: \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information; and  \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \n\n \n9 \n \n \nperson may not properly safeguard protected information. This includes \nbut is not limited to consideration of: \n \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client \nconfidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized release of \nsensitive corporate or other government protected information: \n \n(2) disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior in the \nworkplace;  \n \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and \n \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other \nemployer's time or resources. \n \nApplicant\u2019s employment by C1, and subsequent quitting the company, nearly \nthree years before the U.S. Government determined that C1 posed a security problem \ndoes not establish a trustworthiness concern under AG 16(c) or 16(d). Applicant has \nbeen forthcoming about her employment relationship with C1, which ended in January \n2015. Applicant has no further connection to the company. The Government suggests \nthat Applicant should have reacted quicker in leaving C1 when she became concerned \nafter her trip to Moscow and that she should have reported her suspicions to someone \nin authority. The time she took to leave the company was reasonable since she needed \nto secure other employment to maintain her lifestyle. She had no duty to report the \ninformation that came to her by hearsay about whether a possible former KGB agent \nworked for C2 or C3. Finally, the U.S. Government apparently contracted with C2 and \nC3 and did not become concerned about that vulnerability until September 2017, long \nafter Applicant had divested herself of employment with C1.  \n \nAlthough my findings lead to the conclusion that the personal conduct concerns \nwere not established, I also find that the evidence would support the application of \nmitigating conditions to Applicant\u2019s case. \n \nI have also considered all of the mitigating conditions for personal conduct under \nAG 17 and considered the following relevant:  \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment.  \n \nSince Appellant is no longer employed or affiliated with C1, C2, or C3 it is \nunlikely that she will have any future contact with any of the companies. Applicant\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment were not impacted by her brief \nemployment with C1, which was before it was a known concern to the U.S. \nGovernment. AG 17(c) applies. \n\n \n10 \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a trustworthiness determination by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider \nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for access to \nsensitive information must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. The circumstances tending to \nsupport granting Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to sensitive information are more \nsignificant than the factors weighing towards denying her eligibility for access to \nsensitive information. I considered the recommendations of her co-workers and \nsupervisors, \nwho \nresoundingly \nrecommend \nthat \nApplicant \nbe \ngranted \nher \ntrustworthiness determination. I also considered her strong ties to this country. She has \ndemonstrated her longstanding loyalty to the United States, as well as her reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment.  Even though the Government failed to establish \nany trustworthiness concerns, she also provided sufficient evidence to mitigate any of \nthose concerns.  \n \nOverall the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for access to sensitive information. For all these \nreasons, I conclude that the trustworthiness concerns arising under Guideline B, foreign \ninfluence, and Guideline E, personal conduct, were either not established or were \nmitigated. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph       1.a: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n\n \n11 \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs     2.a - 2.b: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for access to \nsensitive information. Eligibility for access to sensitive information is granted. \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nRobert E.

Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on December 8, \n2015. On March 12, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns \nunder Guidelines F and G. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated in Security Executive Agent Directive 4, National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines (December 10, 2016). \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on May 4, 2018, and requested a decision on the \nwritten record without a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s \n\n \n2 \n \nwritten case on March 8, 2019. On March 12, 2019, a complete copy of the file of \nrelevant material (FORM) was sent to Applicant, who was given an opportunity to file \nobjections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government\u2019s \nevidence. He received the FORM on March 13, 2019. He requested an extension of \ntime to respond to the FORM, and it was granted. He responded on May 10, 2019. His \nresponse was admitted in evidence as Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AX) A, without objection. The \ncase was assigned to me on June 6, 2019.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.d-\n1.f, 2.a, and 2.b. He denied the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c. His admissions are \nincorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 45-year-old mechanic employed by a defense contractor since \nFebruary 2008. He has held a security clearance since September 2008. He worked at \nan automobile dealership from December 1998 to October 2007, when the dealership \nwent out of business. He was unemployed from October 2007 until he began his current \njob. \n \nApplicant married in October 2000 and divorced in February 2007. He has two \nchildren, ages 18 and 15, and he shares custody with his ex-wife. He was paying child \nsupport for both children until recently. He is no longer paying child support or his \ndaughter, now that she is 18 years old. (AX A.) His child support payments are current. \n \n \nApplicant filed a petition for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in June 2002 and received a \ndischarge in September 2002. (FORM Item 7.) The record does not reflect the \ncircumstances of this bankruptcy, and it is not alleged in the SOR. \n \n \nApplicant filed another petition for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in January 2017 and \nreceived a discharge in April 2017. (FORM Item 8.) In his answer to the SOR, he \nattributed this bankruptcy to a back injury in November 2013, back surgery in January \n2014, uninsured medical expenses, and unspecified legal issues in 2015. \n \nWhen Applicant submitted his SCA in December 2015, he disclosed that he had \nfailed to file municipal income tax returns and pay the taxes due for 2013 and 2014, \nestimated at about $400 for each year. In response to DOHA interrogatories, he \nexplained that his delinquent municipal taxes were incurred because he moved from a \nmunicipality without taxes and was unaware that his new place of residence was subject \nto municipal taxes. He submitted a statement reflecting that he owed $740 in municipal \nincome taxes for 2013 and 2014. (FORM Item 6 at 40.) The taxes have not been paid. \n \nIRS tax transcripts reflect that Applicant\u2019s 2013 return was filed late on May 12, \n2014, and there is no indication that an extension of time was granted for this return. A \nsix-month extension of time to file was granted for the 2014 return, and it was filed in \nNovember 2015, about a month after the due date. A six-month extension of time to file \n\n \n3 \n \nwas granted for the 2015 return, and it was filed on December 5, 2016, about two \nmonths after the due date. The 2016 return was filed late on May 29, 2017, and there is \nno indication that an extension was granted for this return. (FORM Item 6 at 34-39.)  \n \nIRS income tax transcripts reflect that Applicant owed $452 for 2013, $797 for \n2015, and $502 for 2016. IRS transcripts reflect that his refund for 2014 was applied to \nhis tax debt. The transcripts also reflect that he made a payment agreement in \nSeptember 2014 and made 11 payments of $25 between March 2015 and October \n2016. (FORM Item 6 at 31-39.). He submitted a copy of his federal income tax return for \n2017 reflecting an anticipated refund of $904. (FORM Item 3.) Applicant has filed his \nfederal income tax return for 2018 and expects a refund, which he will use to pay debts. \n(AX A.) \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM, he stated that during the recent federal \ngovernment five-week shutdown, he used all his savings to stay current on his living \nexpenses, and he is just now starting to recover from his loss of pay. He is living \npaycheck to paycheck. (AX A.) I have taken administrative notice, without objection by \nDepartment Counsel, that the federal government was shut down from December 22, \n2018 to January 26, 2019, during which time many employees of federal contractors \nwere furloughed without pay. \n \n \nApplicant disclosed in his SCA that he was charged with driving under the \ninfluence (DUI) in July 1996. He was convicted, fined, lost his driver\u2019s license for a year, \nand was required to take a three-day alcohol education class. (FORM Item 4 at 31.) \nThis incident was not alleged in the SOR. \n \n \nIn February 2013, Applicant was cited for public intoxication and disorderly \nconduct. (FORM Item 15.) In his SCA, Applicant stated that this incident occurred when \nhe was leaving a bar, knocked over a free-standing sign, and was confronted by a \nsecurity guard who swore at him and ordered him to pick up the sign. Applicant stated \nthat he responded to the security guard in the same hostile and profane manner. He \nadmitted the incident in his answer to the SOR. He paid a fine online. (FORM Item 3 at \n2.) \n \n \nIn April 2015, Applicant and his children were visiting at a friend\u2019s home. \nApplicant and his friend were both drinking heavily. Applicant and his then 14-year-old \ndaughter began arguing. He slipped and fell, and his daughter ridiculed him. He slapped \nhis daughter and grabbed her after she continued to make disrespectful comments and \nkicked him. Someone not identified in the record called the police. Applicant was \nsleeping on a sofa when the police arrived. According to the police report, Applicant was \nso intoxicated that the police needed to hold him upright to handcuff him. He was held in \njail on an \u201cintoxication watch\u201d for six hours. (FORM Item 14 at 4.) He was charged with \ndomestic violence and endangering a child. He self-reported the incident to his security \nmanager. (FORM Item 3 at 2; FORM Item 4 at 29; FORM Item 5.) He hired an attorney \nand demanded a jury trial. A few days before the trial, he accepted a plea bargain and \npleaded guilty to unlawful restraint. He was sentenced in August 2015 to a $200 fine \n\n \n4 \n \nplus court costs. He was placed on probation for two years, required to complete a \ndomestic-violence-awareness class, abstain from alcohol, attend Alcoholics Anonymous \n(AA) meetings, and meet with a probation officer once a month. (FORM Item 5.) \n \nApplicant underwent an alcohol assessment in June 2016 as part of his \nprobation. The results of the assessment were reported to the court, but Applicant was \nnot informed of them He did not receive any alcohol-related treatment or receive a \ndiagnosis or prognosis. (FORM Item 6 at 15.) He was released from probation early, \nafter completing one year.  \n \nWhen Applicant was interviewed by a security investigator in January 2017, he \ntold the investigator that his alcohol use had never affected his work performance, but \nthat it had adversely affected his professional and personal relationships. He abstained \nfrom alcohol from April 2015 to September 2016, because it was a requirement of his \nprobation. He described himself as a social drinker who has two or three glasses of \nwine in the evening on weekends. (FORM Item 6 at 15-16.) \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \n\n \n5 \n \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-\n01253 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr.20, 2016).   \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. \n01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations  \n \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant filed a petition for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in \nJanuary 2017 and received a discharge (SOR \u00b6 1.a). It alleges that he failed to timely \nfile his federal income tax returns for 2013-2016 (SOR \u00b6 1.b); that he failed to timely pay \nthe federal income taxes due for 2013, 2015, and 2016 (SOR \u00b6 1.c); and that he owes \ndelinquent taxes of $452 for 2013, $797 for 2015, and $502 for 2016 (SOR \u00b6 1.f). It \nalleges that he failed to file regional income tax returns for 2014 through 2016 (SOR \u00b6 \n1.d) and that he owes regional income taxes of $740 for 2013 (SOR \u00b6 1.e). The \n\u201cregional\u201d taxes alleged in the SOR were municipal taxes levied by the city in which he \nwas residing. \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is \n\n \n6 \n \nfinancially overextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or \notherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \n \n \nThe allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c, 1.e, and 1.f are established by Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions and the IRS transcripts in the FORM. They reflect that the 2013 return was \nfiled late, in May 2014, and the 2016 return was filed late, in December 2016, with no \nevidence of an extensions being granted. The transcripts also show that the extensions \nwere granted for the 2014 and 2015 returns, but that the returns were not filed by the \nextended due date. Applicant\u2019s explanation that he was unaware of his obligation to file \nmunicipal tax returns, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d, was plausible and reasonable, but he \nhas not taken any steps to resolve the delinquent municipal taxes after learning of his \nobligation to pay them. \n \n \nThe allegations in SOR \u00b6 1.c and 1.f are duplicative, because the delinquent \ntaxes alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f are the result of the failure to timely file alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c. \nWhen the same conduct is alleged twice in the SOR under the same guideline, one of \nthe duplicative allegations should be resolved in Applicant=s favor. See ISCR Case No. \n03-04704 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2005) (same debt alleged twice). Accordingly, I have \nresolved SOR 1.c in Applicant\u2019s favor. \n \n \nThe evidence supporting the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.f is sufficient to raise \nthe following disqualifying conditions under this guideline: \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; \n \nAG \u00b6 19(b): unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \nAG \u00b6 19(f): failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax as required. \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n\n \n7 \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate \ntax authority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with \nthose arrangements. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are numerous, recent, \nand were not incurred under circumstances making recurrence unlikely. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not fully established. Applicant has encountered several conditions \nbeyond his control: a marital break-up in February 2007, unemployment from October \n2007 to February 2008, inability to work due to a back injury in November 2013, and \nuninsured medical expenses in January 2014. The five-week unpaid furlough as a result \nof the government shutdown in December 2018-January 2019 was also a condition \nbeyond his control, which hindered any recent efforts to resolve his debts. However, \nApplicant\u2019s tax delinquencies occurred before the government shutdown. Furthermore, \nhe has not acted responsibly. He made a payment agreement and 11 payments of \ndelinquent federal income taxes, but he took no affirmative actions after October 2016 \nto resolve his federal tax debt. Instead, he has passively waited for the IRS to apply his \nrefunds to unpaid taxes. He has offered no reasonable explanation for his repeated \nfailures to file his federal income tax returns on time. He submitted no evidence of \naffirmative action to resolve his delinquent municipal taxes.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is not established. Applicant has not received financial counseling \nand his tax problems are not resolved. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is not established. Applicant has no payment plans in effect for his \ndelinquent taxes. Relying on involuntary collection of a delinquent debt does not \nconstitute \u201cgood faith\u201d within the meaning of this mitigating condition. See ISCR Case \nNo. 09-5700 (App. Bd. Feb. 24, 2011). \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e) is not established. Applicant has not disputed his federal and \nmunicipal tax debts. \n \n\n \n8 \n \nAG \u00b6 20(g) is not fully established. Applicant has filed all his past-due federal \nreturns, but he has not filed his municipal tax returns, and he has not fully paid the past-\ndue taxes. Furthermore, the fact that Applicant has filed his past-due federal returns \ndoes not end the inquiry. A security clearance adjudication is not a tax-enforcement \nprocedure. It is an evaluation of an individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. \nThe fact that Applicant has filed his past-due returns \u201cdoes not preclude careful \nconsideration of his security worthiness based on longstanding prior behavior \nevidencing irresponsibility.\u201d ISCR Case No. 12-05053 (App. Bd. Oct. 30, 2014). A \nperson who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations does not demonstrate \nthe high degree of good judgment and reliability required of those granted access to \nclassified information. ISCR Case No. 15-00216 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 24, 2016), citing \nCafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 183 (D.C. \nCir. 1960), aff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961) \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n \n \nThe SOR alleges an alcohol-related arrest for domestic abuse in April 2015 \n(SOR \u00b6 2.a) and a citation for public intoxication and disorderly conduct in April 2013 \n(SOR \u00b6 2.b). The concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 21: \u201cExcessive alcohol \nconsumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure to \ncontrol impulses, and can raise questions about an individual's reliability and \ntrustworthiness.\u201d \n \n \nThe following disqualifying conditions under this guideline are potentially \napplicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 22(a): alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving \nwhile under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the \npeace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the \nindividual's alcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with \nalcohol use disorder;  \n \nAG \u00b6 22(c): habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of \nimpaired judgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with \nalcohol use disorder; \n \nAG \u00b6 22(d): diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional \n(e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical social \nworker) of alcohol use disorder; \n \nAG \u00b6 22(e): the failure to follow treatment advice once diagnosed; \n \nAG \u00b6 22(f): alcohol consumption, which is not in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations, after a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder; and \n \n\n \n9 \n \nAG \u00b6 22(g): failure to follow any court order regarding alcohol education, \nevaluation, treatment, or abstinence. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence in the FORM are sufficient \nto establish the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b and raise the disqualifying conditions \nin AG \u00b6 22(a) and 22(c). There is no evidence that Applicant has been diagnosed with \nan \nalcohol \nuse \ndisorder; \nreceived \nany \ncounseling, \ntreatment \nadvice, \nor \nrecommendations regarding his alcohol use; or failed to follow any court orders \nregarding his alcohol use. Thus, the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(d), 22(e), 22(f), \nand 22(g) are not established. \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 23(a): so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does \nnot cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment; \nand \n \nAG \u00b6 23(b): the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations. \n \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 23(a) and 23(b) are established. Applicant\u2019s last alcohol-related incident \nwas more than four years ago. He acknowledged his maladaptive alcohol use, \nsuccessfully completed his probation, abstained from alcohol during his probation, and \nhas moderated his alcohol use. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n\n \n10 \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines F and G in my whole-person \nanalysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d).Because Applicant requested \na determination on the record without a hearing, I had no opportunity to evaluate his \ncredibility and sincerity based on demeanor. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. \nBd. Jul. 23, 2003). After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under \nGuideline F and G, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I \nconclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns raised by his alcohol \nconsumption, but he has not mitigated the security concerns raised by his repeated \nfailures to timely file his tax returns and pay the taxes due. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1.b, 1.e, and 1.f: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.c and 1.d: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption): \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a and 2.b; \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

Applicant has mitigated the security \nconcerns raised by his alcohol consumption, but he has not mitigated the security \nconcerns raised by his financial problems. Eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on December 8, 2015. \nOn March 12, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD \nCAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under \nGuidelines F and G. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated in Security Executive Agent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines (December 10, 2016). \n \n\n \n2 \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on May 4, 2018, and requested a decision on the \nwritten record without a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written \ncase on March 8, 2019. On March 12, 2019, a complete copy of the file of relevant \nmaterial (FORM) was sent to Applicant, who was given an opportunity to file objections \nand submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government\u2019s evidence. He \nreceived the FORM on March 13, 2019. He requested an extension of time to respond to \nthe FORM, and it was granted. He responded on May 10, 2019. His response was \nadmitted in evidence as Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AX) A, without objection. The case was \nassigned to me on June 6, 2019.  \n \n \nOn June 26, 2019, I denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. Applicant \nappealed my decision. On September 6, 2019, the Appeal Board remanded the case, \ndirecting me to reopen the record and provide the parties an opportunity to present \nevidence and argument addressing the apparently conflicting information in the tax \ntranscripts submitted by Applicant. (Appeal Board decision at page 2.)  \n \n \nIn accordance with the Appeal Board decision, I invited Department Counsel and \nApplicant to submit additional evidence and written argument regarding the meaning of \nthe transcripts submitted by Applicant for tax years 2013 through 2016. (Remand Exhibit \nI.) Both parties received the invitation. (Remand Exhibit II.) Department Counsel elected \nto not submit anything further. (Remand Exhibit III.) Applicant submitted a two-page cover \nletter, two pages of bank statements, and two pages of informational materials from the \nIRS. (Remand Exhibit IV.) \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nThe Appeal Board noted that the 2013 Federal tax transcript submitted by \nApplicant contained the following entries near the top of the page: \n \nRETURN DUE DATE OR RETURN RECEIVED DATE (WHICHEVER IS LATER) Apr. 15, 2014 \nPROCESSING DATE \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMay 12, 2014 \n \nHowever, the transcript also contained the following entries further down on the page: \n \n \nCODE EXPLANATION OF TRANSACTION \nCYCLE  \nDATE  \nAMOUNT \n \n150 \nTax return filed  \n \n \n2014705 \n5-12-2014 \n$5,798 \n \nThe apparent conflict between the first line, reflecting that the return was received on or \nbefore April 15, 2014, and the last line, reflecting that the return was filed on May 12, \n2014, was the basis for the Appeal Board\u2019s decision to remand the case. \n \n \nWithout objection from either party, I have taken administrative notice of the portion \nof Section 8A of the IRS Master File Codes pertaining to Transaction Code 150, which \nwas cited in footnote 2 of the Appeal Board decision. The relevant portion of the Master \nFile Codes is attached to the record. (Remand Exhibit V.)  \n \n\n \n3 \n \nIn my original decision, I interpreted the second \u201ctax return filed\u201d entry near the \nbottom of the page, below the reference to Code 150, as the actual date of filing. However, \nmy review of the Master File Codes has convinced me that the entry on the first line is the \ndate on which the return was due or received, whichever is later, and the second entry \nunder Code 150 is the date on which the tax return was processed and the amount of tax \ndue was determined. Accordingly, I have reconsidered and revised my findings of fact \npertaining to the dates on which Applicant filed his federal tax returns for 2013 through \n2016.  \n \n \nMy original findings of fact regarding Applicant\u2019s tax filings are set out below:  \n \nIRS tax transcripts reflect that Applicant\u2019s 2013 return was filed late on May \n12, 2014, and there is no indication that an extension of time was granted \nfor this return. A six-month extension of time to file was granted for the 2014 \nreturn, and it was filed in November 2015, about a month after the due date. \nA six-month extension of time to file was granted for the 2015 return, and it \nwas filed on December 5, 2016, about two months after the due date. The \n2016 return was filed late on May 29, 2017, and there is no indication that \nan extension was granted for this return. (FORM Item 6 at 34-39.)  \n \nI have reconsidered the above findings of fact after reviewing the IRS Master File \nCodes pertaining to Transaction Code 150. My revised findings of fact on reconsideration, \nin place of the above paragraph, are as follows: \n \nThe tax transcripts for 2013 reflect that Applicant timely filed his return on \nApril 15, 2014; that he had a six-month extension for 2014 and filed his \nreturn on October 19, 2015, four days late; that he had a six-month \nextension for 2015 and filed his return on October 17, 2016, two days late; \nand that he timely filed his 2016 return on April 15, 2017. \n \n \nI adhere to and incorporate by reference the remaining findings of fact in my \noriginal decision, including the findings regarding Applicant\u2019s two Chapter 7 bankruptcies, \nhis tax debts, and the findings of fact regarding the allegations under Guideline G.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \n \nI adhere to and incorporate by reference the statement of policies in my original \ndecision.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant filed a petition for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in January \n2017 and received a discharge (SOR \u00b6 1.a). It alleges that he failed to timely file his \nfederal income tax returns for 2013-2016 (SOR \u00b6 1.b); that he failed to timely pay the \nfederal income taxes due for 2013, 2015, and 2016 (SOR \u00b6 1.c); and that he owes \ndelinquent taxes of $452 for 2013, $797 for 2015, and $502 for 2016 (SOR \u00b6 1.f). It alleges \n\n \n4 \n \nthat he failed to file regional income tax returns for 2014 through 2016 (SOR \u00b6 1.d) and \nthat he owes regional income taxes of $740 for 2013 (SOR \u00b6 1.e). The \u201cregional\u201d taxes \nalleged in the SOR were municipal taxes levied by the city in which he was residing. \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \n \n \nThe allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c, 1.e, and 1.f are established by Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions and the IRS transcripts in the FORM. The IRS transcripts reflect that the 2013 \nfederal tax return was timely filed, the 2014 return was filed four days late, the 2015 return \nwas filed two days late, and the 2016 return was timely filed. They also reflect that \nApplicant owed federal taxes for 2013, 2015, and 2016; that Applicant made a payment \nagreement in September 2014; and that he made 11 payments of $26 between March \n2015 and October 2016. The evidence also shows that Applicant timely filed his 2017 \nreturn, reflecting an anticipated refund of $904, and that he timely filed his 2018 return \nand expected a refund. \n \n \nThe allegations in SOR \u00b6 1.c and 1.f are duplicative, because the delinquent taxes \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f are the result of the failure to timely pay the taxes alleged in SOR \u00b6 \n1.c. When the same conduct is alleged twice in the SOR under the same guideline, one \nof the duplicative allegations should be resolved in Applicant=s favor. See ISCR Case No. \n03-04704 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2005) (same debt alleged twice). Accordingly, I have \nresolved SOR 1.c in Applicant\u2019s favor. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s explanation that he was unaware of his obligation to file municipal tax \nreturns, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d, was plausible and reasonable. However, as of the date \nthe record closed, he had not taken any steps to file the past-due returns or resolve the \ndelinquent municipal taxes after learning of his obligation to file the returns and pay the \ntaxes due. \n \n \nThe evidence supporting the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.d-1.f is sufficient to \nraise the following disqualifying conditions under this guideline: \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; \n \nAG \u00b6 19(b): unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n\n \n5 \n \nAG \u00b6 19(f): failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax as required. \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s 2017 bankruptcy was recent, having \noccurred after he submitted his SCA and at about the same time as the tax delinquencies, \nand did not occur under circumstances making recurrence unlikely. His delinquent tax \ndebts are numerous, recent, and were not incurred under circumstances making \nrecurrence unlikely. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not fully established. Applicant has encountered several conditions \nbeyond his control: a marital break-up in February 2007, unemployment from October \n2007 to February 2008, inability to work due to a back injury in November 2013, and \nuninsured medical expenses in January 2014. He has not provided sufficient information \nto determine if his legal expenses were a condition beyond his control. The five-week \nunpaid furlough as a result of the government shutdown in December 2018-January 2019 \n\n \n6 \n \nwas a condition beyond his control, which hindered any recent efforts to resolve his debts. \nHowever, Applicant\u2019s tax debts occurred before the government shutdown. Furthermore, \nhe has not acted responsibly. He made a payment agreement and 11 payments of \ndelinquent federal income taxes, but he has not explained why he stopped making \npayments on his taxes, and he took no affirmative actions after October 2016 to resolve \nhis federal tax debt. Instead, he passively waited for the IRS to apply his refunds to unpaid \ntaxes. He submitted no evidence of affirmative actions to resolve his delinquent municipal \ntaxes.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is not established. Applicant has not received financial counseling and \nhis tax problems are not resolved. He has not provided sufficient information about his \ncurrent income and expenses to determine if his overall financial situation is under control. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is not established. Applicant\u2019s Chapter 7 discharge does not constitute \na good-faith effort to resolve delinquent debts. See ISCR Case No. 11-08274 (App. Bd. \nMay 2, 2013) .When the record closed, Applicant had no payment plans in effect for his \ndelinquent federal taxes. Instead, he relied on the IRS capture of his refunds to pay the \ndelinquent taxes. Relying on involuntary collection of a delinquent debt does not \nconstitute \u201cgood faith\u201d within the meaning of this mitigating condition. See ISCR Case No. \n09-5700 (App. Bd. Feb. 24, 2011). He submitted no evidence of efforts to resolve his \nmunicipal tax debt. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e) is not established. Applicant has not disputed his federal and municipal \ntax debts. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(g) is not fully established. Applicant has filed all his past-due federal \nreturns, but he has not filed his municipal tax returns or paid the municipal taxes, and he \nhad not fully paid the past-due federal taxes as of the date the record closed. The fact \nthat Applicant filed his federal tax returns for 2015 and 2016 a few days late does not \nraise significant security concerns. However, the fact that Applicant has filed his past-due \nfederal returns does not end the inquiry. A security clearance adjudication is not a tax-\nenforcement procedure. It is an evaluation of an individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. The fact that Applicant has filed his past-due returns \u201cdoes not preclude \ncareful consideration of his security worthiness based on longstanding prior behavior \nevidencing irresponsibility.\u201d ISCR Case No. 12-05053 (App. Bd. Oct. 30, 2014). A person \nwho fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations does not demonstrate the high \ndegree of good judgment and reliability required of those granted access to classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 15-00216 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 24, 2016), citing Cafeteria & \nRestaurant Workers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), \naff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). \n \n \nThe amounts of the federal and municipal tax debts are not overwhelming. \nApplicant\u2019s federal tax refunds may have covered all or most of his federal tax debts for \n2015 and 2016. However, the modest amount of Applicant\u2019s federal and municipal tax \ndebts raises the question, unanswered by Applicant, why he did not pay the debts sooner, \n\n \n7 \n \nafter being relieved of significant indebtedness when he received a Chapter 7 discharge \nin April 2017. \n \n \nThe Appeal Board decision noted that Applicant claimed in his appeal brief that he \npaid the federal tax debt before I issued my original decision, but that he submitted no \nevidence to support his claim. He repeated his claim in his submission on remand. My \noriginal decision was based on the evidence in the record as of the date the record closed. \nIf Applicant subsequently paid his delinquent taxes, he may request reconsideration in \naccordance with Directive \u00b6 E3.1.37 through E3.1.39. \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n \n \nI adhere to and incorporate by reference the findings of fact, analysis, and \nconclusions in my original decision. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nI adhere to and incorporate by reference my whole-person analysis in my original \ndecision.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI have reconsidered my findings in accordance with the Appeal Board remand. I \nmake the following findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.d-1.f: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.b and 1.c: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption): \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a and 2.b: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n\n \n8 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nUpon reconsideration, I adhere to my conclusion that it is not clearly consistent \nwith the national security interests of the United States to grant Applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information.

Appel, Esq. \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nLOUGHRAN, Edward W., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant did not mitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn December 21, 2017, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement \nof Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guidelines E (personal \nconduct) and F (financial considerations). Department Counsel subsequently amended \nthe SOR to withdraw the personal conduct allegations and SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e of the \nfinancial considerations allegations. Applicant responded to the SOR on February 1, \n2018, and requested a hearing before an administrative judge.  \nThe case was assigned to another administrative judge on July 20, 2018, and \nreassigned to me on October 10, 2018. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on September 5, 2018, scheduling the hearing for \nOctober 11, 2018. The hearing was convened as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GE) \n1 through 7 were admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified and \nsubmitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through R, which were admitted without objection.  \n01/02/2019\n\n \n2 \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 47-year-old chairman and chief executive officer of a Subchapter S \ncorporation1 doing business as a defense contractor. He has been the primary owner of \nthe company since 2002. He served in the U.S. military from 1989 until he was \nhonorably discharged in 1991. He seeks to retain a security clearance, which he has \nheld for many years. He has a bachelor\u2019s degree, which was awarded in 1994, and a \nmaster\u2019s degree, which he earned in 1995. He is married, but separated. He has four \nadult children.2 \n \n \nApplicant sold a division of his company in 2011. With the profit from the sale and \nhis other income, his adjusted gross income for federal tax purposes was $5,942,002. \nHis tax liability was $1,013,836. The IRS reported that $36,068 was withheld from his \npay; $72,836 was credited from a previous tax period; $200,000 was paid in October \n2012; and the federal income tax return was filed in December 2012. Applicant paid \nanother $200,000 in April 2013; $480 in October 2014; and $8,882 in October 2015. His \ntax refunds for 2013 and 2014 were withheld, and $1,021 and $26,542 were transferred \nto his 2011 tax debt in April 2015. The IRS issued a notice of intent to levy in November \n2014. As of June 2017, with penalties and interest, his tax liability for 2011 was \n$705,014. As of July 2018, it had increased to $724,332.3  \n \n \nApplicant also owes the IRS for tax year 2012, when he received the final \npayment for the sale of the division of his company. His adjusted gross income was \n$267,151. The IRS reported that he was credited with $2,000 and $862 in April 2013, \nbut the IRS records do not indicate any other payments. His federal income tax return \nwas filed in February 2015. As of June 2017, with penalties and interest, his tax liability \nfor 2012 was $58,728. As of July 2018, it had increased to $60,757.4  \n \n \nApplicant stated that he had little choice but to sell the division of his company to \na large company in 2011, as the large company would have taken their business away if \nhe had not sold. The loss of the profitable division adversely affected Applicant\u2019s \ncompany financially. He stated that his accountant advised him to pay the IRS \n$200,000, and that he would be able to receive credits from losses that would permit \nhim to offset the taxes.5 \n                                                          \n1 S corporations are corporations that elect to pass corporate income, losses, deductions, and credits \nthrough to their shareholders for federal tax purposes. Shareholders of S corporations report the flow-\nthrough of income and losses on their personal tax returns and are assessed tax at their individual \nincome tax rates. This allows S corporations to avoid double taxation on the corporate income.

He stated that he put \nmuch of the money that he received from the sale of the division back into the company. \nHe used about $1.6 million from the sale to pay the mortgage loan on his house. He \nalso paid credit cards and car loans, and he put about $200,000 away for his children\u2019s \ncollege education.6  \n \n \nWhen he submitted a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) in \nSeptember 2015, Applicant wrote that he was \u201c[i]n process of putting payment plan in \nplace with IRS.\u201d In July 2017, he responded to DOD interrogatories and wrote that his \naccountants contacted the IRS to establish an installment agreement, but his case was \nawaiting assignment to a local IRS collection office. He wrote that \u201c[o]nce the accounts \nare assigned, we will continue working with the IRS to establish an installment \nagreement.\u201d He testified that his tax experts worked with the IRS for a payment plan, \nbut one was never reached. He stated that he was unaware that he could pay the IRS \noutside of an established payment plan. Applicant stated that his company is doing \nbetter financially and has been awarded several contracts. He plans to pay his back \ntaxes from the additional profits generated by his company.7  \n \n \nWhile his company was struggling, Applicant took on personal debt, and he \npersonally guaranteed debt in order for his company to receive credit. A past-due credit \ncard with a $38,688 balance was closed by the creditor and transferred to a collection \ncompany (SOR \u00b6 1.c). A creditor obtained a judgment of $685,000 against Applicant\u2019s \ncompany and Applicant personally in July 2017 (SOR \u00b6 1.f). Another creditor obtained a \njudgment of $399,363 against Applicant and his company in July 2017 (SOR \u00b6 1.g).8 \n \n \nApplicant entered into a payment agreement with the collection company \nhandling the $38,688 debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c. He agreed to pay $403 per month for 96 \nmonths. He made the first payment under the plan on October 1, 2018.9 \n \n \nApplicant and his company entered into a confidential settlement agreement with \nthe creditor holding the $685,000 judgment in SOR \u00b6 1.f, and the judgment was \nvacated. Applicant\u2019s company agreed to pay $20,000 per week until $479,000 was paid \nto the creditor. Applicant documented that from July 2018 to September 2018, the \ncompany made the ten $20,000 payments required under the settlement agreement.10 \n \n \nApplicant and his company settled the $399,363 judgment in SOR \u00b6 1.g. They \npaid $109,898 to complete the settlement in June 2018.11 \n                                                          \n6 Tr. at 40-45, 63-64, 74-75; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2, 7; AE A, C, D. \n \n7 Tr. at 65-71, 77-80; GE 1, 2, 7; AE B-D, I-K. \n \n8 Tr. at 33, 49-51, 57-59; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 3-6. \n \n9 Tr. at 49-50; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 3, 4; AE E. \n \n10 Tr. at 50-56, 59. 75-76; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 3-5; AE F, R. \n \n11 Tr. at 57-59, 76; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 3, 4, 6; AE G, H. \n\n \n4 \n \nApplicant submitted letters attesting to his honesty, trustworthiness, leadership, \npatriotism, and integrity. He regularly volunteers in his community.12 \n \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n                                                          \n12 AE L-O. \n\n \n5 \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \nApplicant\u2019s adjusted gross income was more than $6 million in 2011 and 2012, \nbut he did not pay all his income taxes. His additional financial problems include \njudgments and a delinquent debt. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above \ndisqualifying conditions.  \n \n  \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n\n \n6 \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \n \nApplicant settled the two judgments and has a payment plan to resolve his credit \ncard debt. While he only documented one payment, and he still has more than seven \nyears of payments, I believe he will continue with the plan. His non-tax debts are \nmitigated. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s tax issues are another matter. He sold a division of his company in \n2011. His adjusted gross income was $5,942,002 in 2011 and $267,151 in 2012. He \nused about $1.6 million from the sale to pay the mortgage loan on his house. He also \npaid credit cards and car loans, and he put about $200,000 away for his children\u2019s \ncollege education. Yet he did not pay all of his federal income taxes. As of July 2018, he \nowed $724,332 for 2011 and $60,757 for 2012. Applicant stated that he intends to pay \nhis taxes. Intentions to pay debts in the future are not a substitute for a track record of \ndebt repayment or other responsible approaches. See ISCR Case No. 11-14570 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Oct. 23, 2013). \n \n \nFailure to comply with tax laws suggests that an applicant has a problem with \nabiding by well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary compliance with \nrules and systems is essential for protecting classified information. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 16-01726 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 28, 2018). A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill \nhis or her legal obligations, such as paying taxes when due, does not demonstrate the \nhigh degree of good judgment and reliability required of those granted access to \nclassified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01382 at 4 (App. Bd. May 16, \n2018).  \n \nThere is insufficient evidence for a determination that Applicant\u2019s tax problems \nwill be resolved within a reasonable period. I am unable to find that he acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances or made a good-faith effort to pay his federal taxes. His tax \nissues are recent and ongoing. They continue to cast doubt on his current reliability, \n\n \n7 \n \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. I find that the security concerns arising out of \nApplicant\u2019s unpaid taxes are not mitigated. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s excellent \ncharacter evidence. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.d-1.e: \n \n \nWithdrawn \nSubparagraphs 1.f-1.g: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nWithdrawn \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.c: \n \n \nWithdrawn \n \n\n \n8 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

Kuhn, Esq. \n______________ \nDecision on Remand \n______________ \nFOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guidelines B (Foreign \nInfluence) and C (Foreign Preference). Eligibility for access to classified information is \ngranted. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on May 16, 2016. On \nDecember 20, 2017, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under \nGuidelines B and C. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines \n(AG) promulgated in Security Executive Agent Directive 4, National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines (December 10, 2016), for all adjudicative decisions on or after \nJune 8, 2017. \n03/04/2019\n\n \n2 \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on February 19, 2018, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on May 2, \n2018, and the case was assigned to an administrative judge on August 7, 2018. On \nAugust 13, 2018, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified \nApplicant that the hearing was scheduled for September 13, 2018. The case was \nreassigned to me on September 4, 2018, due to the unavailability of the previously \nassigned administrative judge. I convened the hearing as scheduled. Department \nCounsel submitted Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 4, which were admitted without \nobjection. Applicant testified, presented the testimony of one witness, and submitted \nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through T, which were admitted without objection. On \nOctober 12, 2018, I granted Applicant\u2019s application for a security clearance.  \n \n \nAt the hearing, Department Counsel refused to submit any official government \ndocuments to support a request for administrative notice about the United Kingdom. He \nstated, \u201cDepartment Counsel does not provide administrative notice where there\u2019s no \ncountry conditions that are relevant to the larger, heightened-risk analysis . . . . [we] do \nnot have administrative notice that is going to provide country conditions for countries \nwe consider the neutral or friendly nations.\u201d (Tr. 13.) He further explained, \u201c[T]he Chief \nDepartment Counsel has determined that we\u2019re not arguing country conditions and . . . \nadministrative notice is not a requirement in every Guideline B case and should only be \nmade when the Government believes it\u2019s relevant to its case.\u201d His final comment in \nresponse to my question whether he was \u201cwilling to leave this in a vacuum\u201d was, \u201cYes, \nYour Honor. We\u2019re not providing the administrative notice for friendly countries. It \nwouldn\u2019t be \u2013 amount to anything more than a travelogue of what it is.\u201d (Tr. 15.) \n \nI concluded that Department Counsel had not submitted sufficient evidence to \nestablish a \u201cheightened risk\u201d of foreign influence or a \u201cpotential conflict of interest.\u201d I \ngranted Applicant\u2019s application for a security clearance. \n \n \nDepartment Counsel appealed my favorable decision, and the Appeal Board \nremanded my decision on January 16, 2018. The Appeal Board held that it was error to \ngrant Applicant a security clearance without evidence in the record of the nature of the \ncountry involved and to appropriately consider the nature of the foreign contacts \ninvolved in the case. The Appeal Board authorized me to reopen the record on the \nmotion of either party. \n \n \nOn January 30, 2019, Department Counsel requested that the record be \nreopened and submitted a request for administrative notice of relevant facts concerning \nthe United Kingdom. (Remand Exhibit I.) I reopened the record and granted the request \nfor administrative notice without objection from Applicant. The facts administratively \nnoticed are set out in my findings of fact. On February 18, 2019, Applicant \nsupplemented the record with Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AX) U. Neither party requested that \nadditional testimony be presented. The record closed on February 21, 2019. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nThe Appeal Board decision and the remand order addressed only the Guideline \nB issues. I adhere to my previous findings of fact, analysis, and conclusions regarding \nthe allegations in the SOR under Guideline C. \n \nFindings of Fact1 \n \n \nUnder Guideline B, the SOR alleges that that Applicant served as an officer in \nthe British Army from 1980 to 2001 (SOR \u00b6 2.a); that he expected to inherit a share of \nhis mother\u2019s property and assets located in the United Kingdom (UK) (SOR \u00b6 2.b); that \nhe maintained contact with \u201cmany foreign nationals\u201d due to his UK citizenship and \nservice in the British Army (SOR \u00b6 2.c); that he has friends and acquaintances who are \nserving in the British Military (SOR \u00b6 2.d); and that he possessed a security clearance \nfrom the UK Ministry of Defense (SOR \u00b6 2.e). \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted SOR \u00b6 2.a, and 2.e. He denied \nSOR \u00b6 2.b, denied \u00b6 2.c in part, and denied \u00b6 2.d. His admissions in his answer and at \nthe hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 56-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He was born in the \nUnited Kingdom, graduated from the UK military academy at Sandhurst, and served as \nan officer in the British Army and held a UK security clearance from 1980 to 2001, when \nhe retired as a lieutenant colonel. While in the British Army, he served as an exchange \nofficer with the US Army from 1997 to 1999. He held a limited DOD security clearance \nwhile serving as an exchange officer. (Tr. 31.) He received two evaluation reports from \nUS Army officers while he was an exchange officer. His rater was a US Army colonel \nand his senior rater was a US Army brigadier general. Both reports gave him the \nhighest possible rating. One report commented, \u201cEvery day he turns in an outstanding \nperformance,\u201d and he \u201chas made it hard for anyone else to be the best.\u201d The other \nreport commented that he had \u201cfar exceeded all other majors and the vast majority of \nlieutenant colonels.\u201d (AX R.) \n \nApplicant testified that he started thinking about \u201cretirement and the next things in \nlife\u201d when he completed his exchange tour and returned to the British Army. When a US \ndefense contractor offered him a job in the United States, he and his family decided to \n\u201ccompletely move.\u201d He submitted his application for early retirement at some time \nbefore March 2001 and retired in August 2001. Applicant and his wife sold their \nresidence in the United Kingdom, and the entire family came to the United States in \nAugust 2001. Applicant has been employed continuously by federal contractors in the \nUnited States as a senior systems engineer from September 2001 to the present. (GX 2 \nat 16; AX S.)  \n \nApplicant and his family became permanent US resident aliens, applied for US \ncitizenship as soon as they were eligible, and became naturalized US citizens. \n                                                          \n1 Applicant\u2019s personal information is extracted from his security clearance application (GX 1) unless \notherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. \n\n \n4 \n \nApplicant, his wife, and one son became US citizens in October 2013. His other two \nsons became US citizens in July and December 2014. His daughter became a US \ncitizen in June 2014. His daughter lives in the United States and is a recruiting manager \nfor a major security company. One of his sons lives with his daughter. His oldest son is \nan investment banker working in the United States. His youngest son also works and \nlives in the United States. (GX 3 at 9-10; AX P; AX Q; Tr. 49-50.) \n \n \nApplicant has a UK passport that was issued in January 2010 and will expire in \nJanuary 2020. He has not used it for foreign travel since he became a US citizen and \nobtained a US passport. (GX 2 at 8-9; GX 3 at 8.) \n \n \nApplicant receives a pension from the United Kingdom for his military service. \nWhen he and his wife reach age 67, they will qualify for retirement pensions from the \nUnited Kingdom, similar to US Social Security.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s father is deceased. His mother is a citizen and resident of the United \nKingdom. She is in failing health, suffers from dementia, and lives in an assisted living \nfacility. Applicant and his brothers expected at one time to inherit his mother\u2019s home and \nassets, but the home has been sold. His mother\u2019s medical expenses are covered by the \nNational Health Service in the United Kingdom, but the cost of living in an assisted living \nfacility is not covered. (Tr. 61.) Applicant anticipates that his mother\u2019s estate will have \nsome cash when she passes away, and it will be split among Applicant and his two \nbrothers. (Tr. 41-42.) \n \n \nBoth of Applicant\u2019s brothers are citizens and residents of the United Kingdom. \nOne is a security officer employed by an educational institution. The other is self-\nemployed as a used-car salesman. (GX 2 at 35-38; GX 3 at 10.) \n \n \nApplicant and his wife purchased a plot of undeveloped property on a remote \nisland in the Bahamas in 2001 for the equivalent of about $8,000. They purchased the \nproperty as an investment. They have never visited the property and it remains \nundeveloped. (Tr. 39-40.) \n \n \nApplicant maintains a bank account with a small balance in the United Kingdom, \nwhich he uses for convenience when he visits and to pay the expenses incurred for his \nmother\u2019s care. His British Army pension, which is about $2,000 per month, is deposited \ndirectly into a bank account in the United States. (Tr. 35.) It was previously deposited in \na UK bank, but he changed it to the US bank in January or February 2018 after learning \nthat a foreign bank account might cause a problem with his application for a security \nclearance. (Tr. 52.) He contributes the maximum allowable amount into a 401(k) \nretirement plan with his current employer. (Tr. 38.) \n \n \nApplicant and his wife own their home in the United States. The market value of \ntheir home is about $400,000, and they have equity in the home of about $220,000 (Tr. \n41; AX K.) \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nWhile Applicant was on active duty and an exchange officer with the US Army, \nhe worked on a system of computer networks for combat vehicles. (Tr. 30.) After he \nretired and was hired by his current employer, he continued to work on basically the \nsame program, which had been adopted by the US Army. (Tr. 29-30.) \n \n \nApplicant testified, \u201cI retain friendship with probably about ten, if that, people.\u201d2 \n(Tr. 43.) All have retired, except for one, a lieutenant general who is still on active duty. \nApplicant testified that a few of his retired colleagues were employed in the defense \nindustry, but he did not know the identity of their employers. He believed that one of his \nretired colleagues may be employed by the military. (Tr. 57.) Applicant and the \nlieutenant general knew each other on active duty and were neighbors when they both \nattended a military school, but Applicant has not maintained contact with him. (Tr. 44.) \nApplicant\u2019s relationship with the lieutenant general was a subject of concern in the \nAppeal Board\u2019s decision.  \n \nThe lieutenant general was present at joint US-British Army staff talks on \ninteroperability between their military units in February 2017. During the staff talks, \nApplicant made a presentation on behalf of the US Government and his program office. \nHis presentation was designed to convince the British Army to buy and adopt the \ncomputer system for combat vehicles developed by his employer and adopted by the \nUS Army, because it would promote interoperability between US and British military \nforces. (Tr. 58.) After his presentation, he \u201cbumped into\u201d the lieutenant general, not \nexpecting him to be there, and they talked briefly. (Tr. 44-45, 58.) Neither Department \nCounsel nor Applicant\u2019s attorney questioned Applicant about the substance of their brief \nconversation.3 \n \nApplicant maintains regular contact with a retired British brigadier,4 who was a \nclassmate at Sandhurst. (Tr. 56.) They served in the same regiment, and they have \ncontact about six times a year. (GX 2 at 19.) The record does not reflect whether the \nbrigadier is currently employed or has any connection, other than his retired status, with \nthe UK Government. \n \nApplicant has quarterly contact with another retired British officer with whom he \nserved. (GX 2 at 42.) This officer lives in India and is self-employed. (GX 4 at 3.) \n                                                          \n2 In Applicant\u2019s submission on remand, he argues that his contacts from his former service in the British \nArmy are \u201cacquaintances\u201d rather than \u201cfriends.\u201d Some of the information in Applicant\u2019s submission is \ntestimonial, providing additional descriptions of the nature of his contacts with present and former British \nofficers. Since neither party requested that the record be opened for additional testimony, I have treated \nApplicant\u2019s submission as argument based on the testimony reflected in the hearing transcript and not as \nadditional testimony.  \n \n3 In Applicant\u2019s submission on remand, he proffered testimony that his conversation with the lieutenant \ngeneral was limited to niceties and questions about family. I have not considered his proffer, because \nneither side requested that the record be reopened for additional testimony. \n \n4 The Appeal Board decision refers to this officer\u2019s rank as \u201cbrigadier general.\u201d The officer\u2019s rank is \nbrigadier, which is the British rank equivalent to a US brigadier general. \n\n \n6 \n \nApplicant has quarterly contact with another retired British officer, with whom he \nattended high school and with whom he served in the same regiment. Applicant is \ngodfather to this retired officer\u2019s son. This retired officer is not currently employed or \naffiliated with the UK Government. (GX 2 at 40-41; GX 4 at 3; AX T at 32.) \n \nApplicant also maintains occasional contact with a retired British Army officer in \nNepal, who was his second in command of a squadron in a British Gurkha brigade and \nhis son\u2019s godfather. They have \u201coccasional, yearly\u201d email contact and see each other on \nFacebook. (Tr. 54-55.) This officer has no current connection with the UK Government. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s facility security officer (FSO) is also a part owner and vice-president \nof the company by whom Applicant is employed. He has worked closely with Applicant \nand has socialized with his family. He testified that Applicant has ties to his past military \nservice and is proud of it, but he is also very proud of being a US citizen. The FSO \nstrongly supports Applicant\u2019s application for a security clearance. (Tr. 18-22.) \n \n \nA retired US Army colonel who worked with Applicant from 2001 to 2017 \nconsiders him a lifelong friend. He admires Applicant for his commitment to the success \nof the US military. He considers Applicant to be honest, dependable, and sincere in his \ndevotion to the United States. (AX H.)  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s performance evaluation for the period ending in January 2018 rated \nhim as exceeding expectations. He was commended for defining and developing \nsystems-engineering processes and his \u201cdogged determination to do the right thing,\u201d \nwhether it was for a customer, the company, or another employee. (AX G.) \n \n \nI have taken administrative notice of the facts recited in the Department of State \nFact Sheet, US Relations with United Kingdom (Feb. 26, 2018), which states in \npertinent part: \n \nThe United States has no closer ally than the United Kingdom, and British \nforeign policy emphasizes close coordination with the United States. \nBilateral cooperation reflects the common language, ideals, and \ndemocratic practices of the two nations. Relations were strengthened by \nthe United Kingdom\u2019s alliance with the United States during both World \nWars, in the Korean conflict, in the Persian Gulf War, in Operation Iraqi \nFreedom, and in Afghanistan, as well as through its role as a founding \nmember of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO. The United \nKingdom and the United States continually consult on foreign policy issues \nand global problems and share major foreign and security policy \nobjectives. \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 US 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\n \n7 \n \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 US at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-\n01253 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr.20, 2016).   \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. \n\n \n8 \n \n01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 US at 531.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 6:  \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual maybe manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with US interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target US citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \n \nThe following potentially disqualifying conditions under this guideline are \nrelevant:   \n \nAG \u00b6 7(a): contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, \nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen \nof or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk \nof foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n \nAG \u00b6 7(b): connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country \nthat create a potential conflict of interest between the individual's \nobligation to protect classified or sensitive information or technology and \nthe individual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by \nproviding that information or technology;  \n \nAG \u00b6 7(c): failure to report or fully disclose, when required, association \nwith a foreign person, group, government, or country; and \n \nAG \u00b6 7(f): substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign \ncountry, or in any foreign owned or foreign-operated business that could \nsubject the individual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or \nexploitation or personal conflict of interest. \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR and at the hearing, he denied that his \nconnections to the United Kingdom made him vulnerable to manipulation, exploitation, \n\n \n9 \n \nor coercion; and he denied that they created a potential conflict of interest. Department \nCounsel set out the Government\u2019s position in this case as follows: \n \n[T]he Government\u2019s heightened risk concern is based primarily upon \nApplicant\u2019s status as a retired senior British army officer receiving a \npension from the British Government, his ongoing relationships with other \nBritish military officers, including two Generals, and his various other ties \nto the United Kingdom, rather than specific country conditions in the \nUnited Kingdom. \n \n(Remand Exhibit I.) \n \n \nThe United States and the United Kingdom are close allies, and the armed forces \nof both countries have a history of bilateral exchanges and cooperation. However, \nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States. \u201cThe United States \nhas a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information from any \nperson, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, regardless of \nwhether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to those of the \nUnited States.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004).  \n \n \nFurthermore, \u201ceven friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the \nUnited States over matters they view as important to their vital interests or national \nsecurity.\u201d ISCR Case No. 00-0317 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2002). Finally, we know friendly \nnations have engaged in espionage against the United States, especially in the \neconomic, scientific, and technical fields. Nevertheless, the nature of a nation\u2019s \ngovernment, its relationship with the United States, and its human rights record are \nrelevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant or an applicant\u2019s family members \nare vulnerable to government coercion. The risk of direct or indirect coercion, \npersuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian \ngovernment, an applicant or an applicant\u2019s family members or friends are associated \nwith or dependent upon the government, or the country is known to conduct intelligence \noperations against the United States.  \n \n \n Applicant\u2019s mother and two brothers, with whom he has regular contact, are \ncitizens of the United Kingdom. However, his family members are not in positions likely \nto cause a conflict of interest. His mother has dementia and resides in an assisted living \nfacility, one brother works for an educational institution, and the other brother is a used-\ncar salesman.  \n \n \nI conclude that the \u201cheightened\u201d risk under AG 7(a) is not established. The \namicable and cooperative relationships between the United States and the United \nKingdom and their armed forces and their shared ideals and democratic practices are \ninconsistent with the coercive and manipulative measures contemplated by AG \u00b6 7(a). \n \n \nHowever, AG \u00b6 7(b) does not include an element of \u201cheightened risk.\u201d Instead, it \nrequires a lower standard of a \u201cpotential\u201d conflict of interest. Of the retired officers with \n\n \n10 \n \nwhom Applicant has continuing contact, three have no current connection to the United \nKingdom beyond their retired status. The record does not reflect whether the retired \nbrigadier, Applicant\u2019s closest friend, has any current governmental connection. \nHowever, the active-duty lieutenant general has a professional interest in the \ntechnology being developed by Applicant and his federal employer. Even though \nApplicant does not maintain social contact with the lieutenant general, Applicant\u2019s \nmilitary status and connections to former comrades in arms, including a retired brigadier \n(whose current employment, if any, is not reflected in the record) are sufficient to raise \nthe potential conflict of interest contemplated by AG \u00b6 7(b).  \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable:  \n \nAG \u00b6 8(a): the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country \nin which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; \n \nAG \u00b6 8(b): there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s \nsense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the \ngroup, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such \ndeep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, \nthat the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in \nfavor of the US interest;  \n \nAG \u00b6 8(c): contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; \n \nAG \u00b6 8(d): the foreign contacts and activities are on US Government \nbusiness or are approved by the agency head or designee; \n \nAG \u00b6 8(e): the individual has promptly complied with existing agency \nrequirements regarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from \npersons, groups, or organizations from a foreign country; and \n \nAG \u00b6 8(f): the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or \nproperty interests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and \ncould not be used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the \nindividual. \n \nAG \u00b6 8(a) is partially established. The United States and United Kingdom have a \nclose, amicable, and cooperative relationship with shared ideals. All but one of \nApplicant\u2019s military comrades in arms are retired. Three of the four with whom he \nmaintains regular contact have no current affiliation with the UK government beyond \n\n \n11 \n \ntheir retired status. He has had no contact with the active-duty lieutenant general except \nfor the unexpected meeting in February 2016. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 8(b) is established. Applicant served honorably in the British Army for 21 \nyears, including two years as an exchange officer with the US Army, during which he \nheld a limited clearance from the DOD and established a track record of protecting \nsensitive and classified information. While serving as an exchange officer, he developed \na strong affinity for the United States. Since Applicant\u2019s immigration to the United States \nin August 2001, he has developed deep and long-standing relationships and loyalties in \nthe United States. When presented with an opportunity to pursue a second career as a \nUS citizen, he and his family jumped at the opportunity, moved to the United States, and \nbecame US citizens as soon as possible. His children have established careers in the \nUnited States. He has substantial financial interests in the United States. He has been \nemployed by US defense contractors for more than 17 years. As a US citizen and the \nemployee of a defense contractor, he has earned a reputation as a talented, honest, \ndependable, and loyal member of the US defense establishment.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 8(c) is established for most of Applicant\u2019s former comrades in arms except \nfor the retired brigadier, the retired officer for whose son Applicant is a godfather, and \nthe retired officer who is the godfather for one of Applicant\u2019s sons. Applicant\u2019s only \ncontact with the active-duty lieutenant general was the one unexpected meeting in \nFebruary 2016. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 8(d) is established for the February 2016 meeting with the lieutenant \ngeneral, which was during official US business. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 8(e) is established for the retired brigadier and the four retired officers with \nwhom Applicant maintains contact. He disclosed those relationships in his two SCAs \nand during interviews with security investigators. There is no evidence in the record \nshowing a requirement for after-the-fact reporting of the unexpected meeting with the \nlieutenant general. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 8(f) is established. Whatever inheritance, if any, Applicant may receive after \nthe demise of his ailing mother is substantially outweighed by his financial interests in \nthe United States. Department Counsel conceded that its concern is based on \nApplicant\u2019s retired military status and his ongoing relationships with British officers. \nThus, there is no issue regarding the likelihood that that Applicant\u2019s military pension and \nentitlement to a retirement pension at age 67 would be leveraged by the UK \nGovernment to coerce him to disclose sensitive or classified information is not at issue. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \n\n \n12 \n \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d).5  \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline B and C (in my original \ndecision) in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. Applicant has \nbeen candid and open throughout the security-clearance process. He retains an affinity \nfor certain cultural aspects of the United Kingdom, but he has clearly demonstrated his \nloyalty to his adopted country. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions \nunder Guidelines B and C, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole \nperson, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns raised by his former \nlife as a British military officer, his continued affinity for his former friends and comrades \nin arms, his minimal foreign financial interests, and his family members residing in the \nUnited Kingdom. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline C (Foreign Preference): \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline B (Foreign Influence):  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.e: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information. Clearance \nis granted. \n \n \n \n \nLeRoy F. Foreman \nAdministrative Judge \n                                                          \n5 The factors are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the \nconduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n",

Williams, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n05/09/2019 \n \n__________ \n \nDecision \n__________ \n  \n \nRIVERA, Juan J., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems could be attributed, in part, to circumstances \nbeyond his control. He resolved one account and has been paying on the other. He filed \nboth of his overdue returns, and intends to establish a payment agreement with the IRS \nand his state if he owes taxes. He has been acting responsibly under the \ncircumstances. His financial problems are being resolved and are under control. \nClearance granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on April 5, 2016, \nseeking a clearance required for his position with a federal contractor. After reviewing \nthe information gathered during the background investigation, the Department of \nDefense (DOD) issued him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on October 27, 2017, \nalleging security concerns under Guideline F (financial considerations). Applicant \nanswered the SOR on December 16, 2017, and requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA).  \n \nDOHA assigned the case to me on July 19, 2018, and issued a notice of \nappearance on January 22, 2019, convening a hearing on February 13, 2019. At the \n\n \n2 \n \n \nhearing, the Government offered four exhibits (GE 1 through 4). Applicant testified, \npresented the testimony of his wife, and submitted two exhibits (AE 1 and 2). After the \nhearing, Applicant timely submitted a set of documents (AE 3), which included a letter \nfrom his wife\u2019s psychologist, and documents from his tax preparer indicating that \nApplicant filed and the IRS accepted his income tax returns for tax years 2016 through \n2018. All exhibits were admitted without objection. DOHA received the hearing \ntranscript (Tr.) on February 26, 2019. \n \nProcedural Issues \n \nAfter the hearing, I amended the SOR sua sponte by adding the following two \nparagraphs: \u201c1.c. You failed to file federal and state income tax returns for tax years \n2016 and 2017.\" and \"1.d. You failed to pay federal and state taxes for tax years 2016 \nand 2017.\u201d (See Tr. 60-63, and Hearing Exhibit (HE) 1 (email to Applicant with the \namended allegations.) The SOR was amended to conform it to the evidence admitted. \n(See Directive, Enclosure 3 (Additional Procedural Guidance), Paragraph E3.1.17.) \n \nApplicant was given the option to request a hearing to address the new SOR \nallegations or to submit documentary evidence to mitigate or explain the allegations. He \nelected to submit additional documentary evidence (AE 3) and did not request a hearing \n(AE 4). \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant was indebted to a bank in the amount of $19,982 \nfor an account that was charged-off (SOR \u00b6 1.a), and that he was indebted in the \namount of $7,012 on an account placed for collection (SOR \u00b6 1.b). Applicant denied \nboth allegations because he was making payments on both accounts. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c alleged that Applicant failed to timely file federal and state income tax \nreturns for tax years 2016 and 2017; and that he failed to pay federal and state income \ntaxes for the same tax years (SOR \u00b6 1.d). Applicant admitted both SOR tax allegations. \n(AE 4) His admissions to the SOR and at his hearing are incorporated herein as findings \nof fact. After a thorough review of the record evidence, including his testimony and all \nevidence admitted, I make the following additional findings of fact:  \n \nApplicant is a 60-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He did not complete \nhigh school and has no further formal education. He married his wife in 1990, and he \nhas two sons, ages 26 and 23. (Tr. 18) His wife has been managing the family finances, \nincluding the filing of their joint income tax returns. \n \nApplicant has worked for different federal contractors since 1997. His current \nemployer and security sponsor hired him in July 2017. This is his first clearance \napplication. Apparently, he held an interim secret clearance between July and October \n2017. \n \n\n3 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems started when his wife was laid off in 2012, and she \nwas unemployed or underemployed for two years. During that period, she held some \npart-time jobs as an independent contractor. Notwithstanding, their combined earnings \nwere insufficient to pay for their accumulated debts and living expenses and many of \ntheir accounts became delinquent. (Tr. 12-13) Applicant\u2019s sister-in-law and friends \nhelped them financially during this period of financial distress. \n \nApplicant and his wife\u2019s main concern during this period of financial difficulty was \nnot to lose their home, and paying their mortgage was their first priority. The remaining \nfinancial obligations were paid after the mortgage was paid based on their respective \npriorities. Applicant and his wife established payment agreements with their creditors to \npay their delinquent debts. I note that the July 2017 credit report (GE 2), shows other \ncharged-off or in collection accounts that were not alleged in the SOR. At least three of \nthose accounts were paid by Applicant after they were charged off. The accounts were \npaid well before the issuance of the SOR.  \n \nConcerning SOR \u00b6 1.a, the documentary evidence shows that Applicant and his \nwife had at least two accounts with the creditor. They established a payment agreement \nfor one account in August 2014, and made consecutive payments until the debt was \npaid off in 2015. For the second account, it appears they established a payment \nagreement on or about April 2016, and have been making consecutive payments since. \n(See documents attached to SOR answer.) \n \nRegarding SOR \u00b6 1.b, Applicant and his spouse entered into a payment \nagreement with the creditor in December 2017. (See documents attached to SOR \nanswer.) They credibly testified that they have been making $50 monthly payments, and \nanticipate increasing their payments when other debts are satisfied.  \n \nIn addition to his wife\u2019s unemployment period, Applicant identified other \ncircumstances that hindered their ability to pay their debts in a more timely fashion. In \nJanuary 2018, Applicant\u2019s wife withdrew $10,000 from her retirement account to pay \nemergency expenses cause by a burst water heater and a subsequently flooded \nbasement, and a burst sewage pipe that was also flooding the underneath of the house. \nAdditionally, they had several vehicle repairs, and had to purchase a new refrigerator \nand a microwave oven because the old ones stopped working. \n \nAt his hearing, Applicant testified that he and his wife had not filed his 2016 and \n2017 income tax returns (SOR \u00b6 1.c). They did not file their 2016 income tax return \nbecause his wife was in charge of the household finances, including completing and \nfiling their income tax returns, and she procrastinated. Applicant\u2019s wife struggles with a \ntrauma history and related anxiety symptoms that impede her ability to focus and cause \nher to use avoidance as a coping mechanism. Apparently, their financial problems \ncause anxiety to her, because they owed taxes and did not have the money to pay the \ntax owed. Applicant\u2019s wife has been participating in weekly counseling since 2013. In \nher psychologist\u2019s opinion, it is likely that her anxiety was a significant contributing factor \nto her not completing her taxes on time. (AE 3) Concerning their 2017 income tax \n \n\n4 \n \n \nreturn, they did not file it because they believed they needed to file his 2016 return first \nto avoid raising an IRS audit flag. \n \nThis being Applicant\u2019s first clearance application, he was not aware of the \nsecurity concerns raised by his financial problems and by not filing his tax returns on \ntime. After the hearing, Applicant submitted documentary evidence showing that he and \nhis wife filed their 2016, 2017, and 2018 income tax returns in March 2019. It is \nundetermined from the evidence submitted the extent of Applicant\u2019s past-due taxes \n(SOR \u00b6 1.d). However, he credibly promised to work with the IRS and establish a \npayment agreement. I gave Applicant\u2019s promise weight and credence because he and \nhis wife established payment agreements and paid off a number of accounts after they \nwere charged off. \n \nApplicant does not consider himself to be a risk to the U.S. Government. He \nbelieves himself to be honest, reliable, hardworking, and a good employee. He believes \nhe will be devastated if he was to lose his clearance eligibility because he would likely \nlose his job, and at his age, it would be difficult to get a new job. Applicant likes and \nvalues his job and loves the United States. He stated that he would never do anything to \nhurt his country or jeopardize his family. He tries to be a stand-up person, works hard, \nand his clearance eligibility means everything to him.  \n \nApplicant acknowledged that he made a mistake when he failed to timely file his \nfederal and state income tax returns. He acknowledged that he and his wife should \nhave been more diligent about filing their income tax returns. He believes that he has \nlearned a valuable lesson. As a result of his hearing and the clearance process, he now \nunderstands the seriousness of the concerns raised by his financial and tax problems.  \n \nApplicant highlighted his 22 years of employment with federal contractors. He \nbelieves that his financial situation is now stable because both he and his wife are \nworking full time. He promised to timely file and pay his taxes in the future. Applicant \nalso promised to be more proactive ensuring that his tax returns are timely filed and any \ntaxes owed paid. \n \nPolicies \n \nThe SOR was issued under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive) \n(January 2, 1992), as amended; and the  Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining \nEligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position \n(AG), implemented by the DOD on June 8, 2017.  \n \nEligibility for access to classified information may be granted \u201conly upon a finding \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, \u00a7 2. The \nU.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive Branch \nin regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing that \u201cno \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \none has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). \n \nThe AG list disqualifying and mitigating conditions for evaluating a person\u2019s \nsuitability for access to classified information. Any one disqualifying or mitigating \ncondition is not, by itself, conclusive. However, the AG should be followed where a case \ncan be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to \nclassified information. Each decision must reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense \nconsideration of the whole person and the factors listed in SEAD 4, App. A \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) and \n2(f). All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, must be considered.  \n \nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government \nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, \nthe burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. The \napplicant bears the heavy burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue his or her security clearance.  \n \nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interest as their own. \nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n\u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \nEgan, 484 U.S. at 531; SEAD 4, \u00b6 E(4); SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 1(d) and 2(b). Clearance \ndecisions are not a determination of the loyalty of the applicant concerned. They are \nmerely an indication that the applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines the \nGovernment has established for issuing a clearance. \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems:  \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. Financial distress can also be caused or \nexacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of \npersonnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental health \nconditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife was laid off in 2012 and was unemployed and underemployed \nfor a period of two years. During that period, some of their debts became delinquent and \nothers were charged-off. He also failed to timely file federal and state income tax returns \nfor tax years 2016 and 2017, and acquired an undetermined tax debt.  \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d; and \n\u201c(f) (failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns \nor failure to pay . . . . income tax as required.\u201d The record established the disqualifying \nconditions, requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating \nconditions.  \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n  \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem from \na legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling \nservice, and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved \nor is under control; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nThe Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the \napplicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance \nof a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \n\n \n7 \n \n \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for \naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  \n \n \nMost of the above financial considerations mitigating conditions are raised by the \nfacts in this case and mitigate the security concerns. Applicant\u2019s financial problems are \nongoing and recent because he is still paying one of the SOR debts and it is unknown \nwhether he owes taxes. Notwithstanding, his financial problems could be attributed to, \nor were aggravated by, circumstances beyond his control (his wife\u2019s unemployment and \nunderemployment period, and her medical condition). Also, his financial problems \noccurred under circumstances unlikely to recur and they do not cast doubt on his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment.  \n \n \nApplicant has filed his income tax returns for tax years 2016 and 2017, and \nintends to establish a payment arrangement with the IRS if he owes any back taxes. \nApplicant acknowledged he made a mistake by not timely filing his tax returns and \nbelieving his wife had taken care of filing the taxes. He now understands that he should \nhave been more diligent filing and paying his taxes. Applicant became aware of the \nsecurity concerns raised by his failure to file his income tax returns at his hearing. He \nthen quickly made arrangements with a tax preparer to help him resolve his tax \nproblems.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s efforts to timely file and pay his taxes are not ideal, but he has made \na good effort to resolve his tax problems. I note that Applicant has paid most of the \ndelinquent or charged-off debts resulting from his wife\u2019s period of unemployment. Taken \nas a whole, his actions show diligence and responsibility in the handling of his tax \nobligations. \n \n \nConsidering the evidence as a whole, and including his recent actions, Applicant \nhas demonstrated financial responsibility under the circumstances. His financial \nsituation is improving and there are clear indications that his financial problems are \nbeing resolved and under control.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, and under the whole-person \nconcept. SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and 2(d). I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of these factors were addressed under \nthat guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant is a 60-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He has worked for \ndifferent federal contractors since 1997. His current employer and security sponsor \n\n \n8 \n \n \nhired him in July 2017. This is his first clearance application. The record evidence is \nsufficient to establish that his financial problems were caused, in part, by circumstances \nbeyond his control. Moreover, Applicant is resolving his financial problems and they are \nunder control. He is fully aware of the security concerns raised by his failure to timely \nfile and pay his taxes. He promised to maintain financial responsibility to ensure that he \ncontinues to be eligible for a clearance. The financial considerations security concerns \nare mitigated. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \n  \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n  \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.d:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant  \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest of the United States to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance to Applicant. Clearance is granted. \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nJUAN J. RIVERA \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Eligibility to occupy a public trust position is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn May 31, 2016, Applicant applied for a public trust position and submitted an \nElectronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP). On an unspecified date, \nthe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued him a set of interrogatories. \nHe responded to those interrogatories on January 29, 2018. On February 6, 2018, the \nDepartment of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to him, under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and \nmodified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive); DOD Manual \n5200.02, Procedures for the DOD Personnel Security Program (PSP) (April 5, 2017) \n(Manual); and Directive 4 of the Security Executive Agent (SEAD 4), National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines (December 10, 2016) (AG), for all covered individuals who \n12/31/2018\n\n \n2 \n                                      \n \nrequire initial or continued eligibility for access to classified information or eligibility to hold \na sensitive position, effective June 8, 2017. \n \nThe SOR alleged trustworthiness concerns under Guidelines J (Criminal Conduct) \nand E (Personal Conduct), and detailed reasons why the DOD CAF was unable to make \nan affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for occupying a public trust position to support a \ncontract with the DOD. The SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to \ndetermine whether such eligibility should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  \n \n \nApplicant received the SOR on February 17, 2018. In a sworn statement, dated \nMarch 1, 2018, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge. Department Counsel indicated the Government was prepared to \nproceed on April 5, 2018. The case was assigned to me on June 18, 2018. A Notice of \nHearing was issued on June 29, 2018, scheduling the hearing for July 25, 2018. I \nconvened the hearing as scheduled. \n \n \nDuring the hearing, Government exhibits (GE) 1 through GE 7 and Applicant \nexhibit (AE) A were admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant and one witness \ntestified. The transcript (Tr.) was received on August 6, 2018. The record closed on July \n25, 2018. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with comments, all of the factual \nallegations pertaining to criminal conduct in the SOR (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.d.). \nApplicant did not admit or deny the allegations pertaining to personal conduct (SOR \u00b6 \n2.a.), so a denial was registered as to that allegation. Applicant\u2019s admissions and \ncomments are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough \nreview of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the \nfollowing additional findings of fact:  \n \nApplicant is a 49-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving \nas a solution-delivery designer with his current employer since April 2016. He completed \nhis high school education through the General Educational Development (GED) Program \nin 1987. He also earned some college credits, but no degree. Applicant enlisted in the \nArmy National Guard in February 1987, and he remained with the National Guard until he \nwas transferred to the U.S. Army Reserve in October 1987. In August 1988, after \nreceiving administrative disciplinary punishment by written counseling or under Article 15, \nUniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) on three separate occasions for (1) \u201cbouncing\u201d \nseveral checks, (2) having long hair, and (3) being under the influence of alcohol, he was \nadministratively discharged and issued an uncharacterized discharge while training. \nApplicant was granted a confidential clearance in 1988, and he held a secret clearance \nfrom 2007 until 2008. Applicant was married in 1993 and separated in 2011. He has been \ncohabiting since April 2013. He has two children, born in 1996 and 1999. \n \n \n \n\n \n3 \n                                      \n \nCriminal Conduct and Personal Conduct \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s relationship with his wife has been rather toxic and volatile. He noted \nthat his wife has mental-health issues, and that she has been hospitalized and \ninstitutionalized on several occasions. Because of a variety of issues created by his wife\u2019s \nerratic behavior, and her refusal to take her medication, Applicant and his wife have been \ninvolved in a series of incidents that have escalated to alleged mutual domestic violence, \nas well as police and court interventions: \n \n \n(SOR \u00b6.1.a.): In September 2006, Applicant sustained a head injury because of a \nmotorcycle accident, and the result was equilibrium problems and extreme dizziness that \nleft him temporarily unable to stand up. On November 26, 2006, he and his wife were \narguing about reasons he could not recall. Applicant\u2019s wife ordered him out of the house \nand started kicking and pushing him, and even attempted to push him down the stairs. \nHe did not strike her, but he did grab her as he was falling. She eventually went outside \nto talk on the telephone, and when she did, Applicant locked the door behind her and \ncalled the sheriff. The sheriff interviewed both parties, and issued citations for harassment \nto both Applicant and his wife. Applicant was permitted to remain in the house with his \nson that night, while his wife was persuaded to leave with her father and brother.1 The \nfollowing day, she returned home while he was packing for a job interview in another \nstate. Once again, an argument ensued, and again it involved her kicking and pushing \nApplicant. He did not strike her. When she went outside to talk on the telephone, Applicant \nagain locked the door and called the sheriff. The sheriff remained in the residence to \nenable Applicant to complete his packing and leave. Neither party was arrested.2 \n \nAs a result of the harassment citations, Applicant and his wife were offered \naccelerated rehabilitative disposition (ARD), a special pre-trial intervention program in the \nstate for non-violent offenders with no prior or limited record. The primary purpose of the \nprogram is the rehabilitation of the offender and secondarily the prompt disposition of \ncharges, eliminating the need for costly and time-consuming trials or other court \nproceedings. They both successfully completed the program on December 19, 2006.3 \n(SOR \u00b6.1.b.): On November 27, 2006, the date of the second incident, Applicant\u2019s \nwife filed an emergency protection from abuse order (PFA) - a civil order of the court \navailable to victims of domestic violence, sexual assault and stalking, that prohibits the \noffender from abusing, stalking, harassing, threatening or attempting to use physical force \nthat would reasonably cause bodily injury to the victim \u2013 following the advice of a woman\u2019s \nsupport group, claiming Applicant beat their children.4 Applicant offered two separate \n                                                          \n1 GE 2 (Personal Subject Interview, dated November 28, 2007), at 2; GE 2 (Personal Subject \nInterview, dated April 2, 2012), at 2-3; GE 3 (Non-Traffic Docket (Applicant), dated December 19, 2006); \nGE 4 (Non-Traffic Docket (Wife), dated December 19, 2006). \n \n2 GE 2 (2012), supra note 1, at 3; Tr. at 34-35. \n \n3 GE 3, supra note 1; GE 4, supra note 1. \n \n4 GE 2 (Personal Subject Interview, dated November 28, 2007), at 1; GE 2 (2012), supra note 1, at \n3; GE 2 (Personal Subject Interview, dated May 18, 2017), at 7; Tr. at 38. \n\n \n4 \n                                      \n \naccounts regarding the PFA, initially claiming that he was unaware of it, but later \nacknowledging that it was served on him. He was told not to have contact with his wife. \nSeveral months later, during a period of reconciliation, Applicant and his wife were seen \ntogether, and someone not identified reported the PFA violation to the sheriff. On March \n29, 2007, the sheriff came to the family residence and arrested Applicant for contempt for \nviolating the PFA. Unable to obtain $10,000 bail, Applicant remained in jail until April 5, \n2007.5 Applicant\u2019s wife made several attempts to have the PFA rescinded, and on that \ndate, the district attorney\u2019s motion to withdraw the violation was granted and the matter \nwas dismissed.6 \n \nIn April 2013, Applicant went to visit his sons for a week and work on the mediation \npapers for an amicable divorce. Somehow, Applicant\u2019s wife obtained control of his \ntelephone and found text messages from his at that point, future cohabitant. She became \nenraged and they got into an argument. She tore up the divorce paperwork. She also \nattempted to remove the clothing he had in his vehicle and tried to take the vehicle. They \nstruggled at the doorway to the vehicle. Applicant called the police who arrived and \nobserved her screaming and yelling, and attempting to throw his belongings out of the \nvehicle. No one was arrested, and Applicant returned home without further incident.7  \n \n(SOR \u00b6.1.c.): On June 24, 2013, Applicant\u2019s wife filed a criminal complaint against \nhim for grabbing her arm and pushing her. When the police arrived, they interviewed \nApplicant\u2019s wife and children. She claimed that Applicant grabbed her arm during a \nconfrontation identical to the one that occurred in April 2013. The two sons \u2013 then \napproximately 17 and 14 years of age \u2013 denied that Applicant touched her. She then \nrequested a person the police described as her \u201cfriend,\u201d but actually her brother, to \nconfirm that Applicant grabbed her arm while she was removing items from the vehicle \nthat her brother had \u201cdoctored\u201d so the engine would not start. A warrant of arrest was \nissued, and Applicant\u2019s wife obtained her own warrant. She also filed a request for an \nemergency protective order \u2013 family abuse (EPO).8 The following day, while attending a \n                                                          \n5 GE 2 (2012), supra note 1, at 4; GE 6 (Miscellaneous Docket \u2013 Indirect Criminal Contempt), dated \nApril 12, 2007). \n \n6 GE 2 (2012), supra note 1, at 4; GE 6, supra note 4, at 2; GE 5 (Miscellaneous Docket \u2013 PFA \nCost Collection, dated July 13, 2007). \n \n7 GE 2 (2017), supra note 4, at 6; Tr. at 44. \n \n8 AE A (Reporting Officer Narrative, dated June 24, 2013); AE A (Criminal Complaint, dated June \n24, 2013); AE A (Warrant of Arrest \u2013 Misdemeanor, dated June 24, 2013); AE A (EPO, dated June 24, \n2013); AE A (Summons, dated July 15, 2013); GE 7 (Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Identification \nRecord, dated June 23, 2016); Tr. at 46-47. Unalleged conduct can be considered for certain purposes, as \ndiscussed by the DOHA Appeal Board. (Conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered: (a) to assess \nan applicant's credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant's evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed \ncircumstances; (c) to consider whether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; (d) to \ndecide whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence \nfor whole-person analysis under Directive \u00a7 6.3.). See ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, \n2006); (citing ISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-0633 at 3 (App. \nBd. Oct. 24, 2003)). See also ISCR Case No. 12-09719 at 3 (App. Bd. April 6, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. \n14-00151 at 3, n. 1 (App. Bd. Sept. 12, 2014); ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006)). \nApplicant\u2019s unalleged EPO will be considered only for the five purposes listed above.  \n\n \n5 \n                                      \n \ncustody hearing at the family courthouse, Applicant was arrested for assault and battery \nagainst a family or household member, a class 1 misdemeanor. After spending several \nhours in jail, he was released and allowed to return to his out-of-state home until the \neventual hearing date.9 On September 26, 2013, after hearing the conflicting testimony \nfrom the police officers, Applicant\u2019s wife, and her brother, the charges were nolle prossed, \nand the EPO was dismissed, with the judge admonishing Applicant\u2019s wife for abusing the \nsystem.10 Applicant contends that his wife leverages the system, and that the charges \nand EPO were intended to prevent him from visiting his children and recovering his \npersonal property. \n \nApplicant\u2019s relationship with his cohabitant \u2013 now referred to as his fianc\u00e9e - has \nalso been at times somewhat volatile. She has had anger and psychiatric issues that \nrequired medication, and because of those issues, they have separated periodically. \nHowever, now that she is back on her medication, her issues have been successfully \nmodified.11  \n \n(SOR \u00b6.1.d.): Applicant and his fianc\u00e9e reunited in February 2017, after a three- \nmonth separation, and they were still having difficulties over their relationship. On April \n22, 2017, although Applicant tried holding her hand to stop her from doing more harm, \nshe pushed and struck him, and slammed his wrist in the door. Applicant pushed her \naway. At one point during their disagreement, she went outside and threw a hatchet at \nthe house, putting a hole in the house.12 Applicant called the police. When the police \narrived, Applicant\u2019s wrist was treated with an ice pack and wrap, and both Applicant and \nhis fianc\u00e9e were interviewed. Applicant\u2019s fianc\u00e9e acknowledged having anger issues, \nleading to violent outbursts, and denied that Applicant struck her. Nevertheless, both \nApplicant and his fianc\u00e9e were arrested and charged with domestic violence, 3rd degree.13 \nOn October 2, 2017, the court found Applicant not guilty of the charge and dismissed the \ncharge nolle prossed. All records pertaining to the charge were ordered expunged and \ndestroyed.14 \n                                                          \n \n9 GE 2 (2017), supra note 4, at 6-7; AE A (Recognizance, dated June 25, 2013_. \n \n10 GE 7, supra note 8, at 2; GE 2 (2017), supra note 4, at 7; Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, dated \nMarch 1, 2018. \n \n11 Tr. at 29, 50-51. \n \n12 Tr. 51-53, 64-65. \n13 GE 2 (Order for Destruction of Arrest Records, dated November 3, 2017); Applicant\u2019s Answer to \nthe SOR, supra note 10.

Although the statute was previously modified to allow the officer freedom to decide if an arrest \nshould in fact be made, most officers take the position that they must still make an arrest to remove one \nperson from the dispute to prevent or minimize potential or further injury. \n14 GE 2 (Order for Destruction of Arrest Records), supra note 13. \n\n \n6 \n                                      \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a [position of public trust].\u201d15 As Commander in Chief, the President \nhas the authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to \ndetermine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such \ninformation. DOD contractor personnel are afforded the right to the procedures contained \nin the Directive before any final unfavorable access determination may be made.16  \n \nPositions formerly designated as ADP I or ADP II are classified as noncritical-\nsensitive positions and include those personnel \u201c[w]ith access to automated systems that \ncontain military active duty, guard, or reservists\u2019 personally identifiable information or \ninformation pertaining to Service members that is otherwise protected from disclosure by \n[the DOD Privacy Program] where such access has the potential to cause serious \ndamage to the national security.\u201d17 \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor a public trust position. \n \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and common \nsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. \n \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d18 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish \n                                                          \n \n15 Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). \n \n16 It should be noted that a memorandum from the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for \nCounterintelligence and Security, Adjudication of Trustworthiness Cases, dated November 19, 2004, \ncovers the handling of trustworthiness cases under the Directive. The memorandum directed the Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) to continue to utilize the Directive in ADP contractor cases for \ntrustworthiness determinations. \n \n17 Manual, \u00b6 4.1a(3)(c). \n \n18 \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as \nadequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 \nat 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1).  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla \n\n \n7 \n                                      \n \na potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced \nsubstantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nhas the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation \nor mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.19  \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to sensitive \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information.  Furthermore, security clearance \ndeterminations, and by inference, public trust determinations, should err, if they must, on \nthe side of denials.20 In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set \nout in AG \u00b6 30: Criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to \ncomply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \nThe guideline notes two conditions under AG \u00b6 31 that could raise trustworthiness \nconcerns: \n \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted.  \n                                                          \nbut less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. \n1994). \n \n19 See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \n20 Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n\n \n8 \n                                      \n \nThere are allegations that Applicant was, on four occasions, between November \n2006 and April 2017, cited or arrested and charged with a variety of crimes, all essentially \nassociated with domestic violence. Applicant disputed the underlying bases of all of the \nincidents, and steadfastly denied that he was the aggressor during the three domestic \nviolence incidents, or that he knowingly violated the alleged PFA and the unalleged EPO. \nNevertheless, based on the actions described above, AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and 31(b) have been \nestablished. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions under AG \u00b6 32 that could \nmitigate security concerns arising from criminal conduct. They include: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the offense.  \n \nAG \u00b6 32(a) applies, but AG \u00b6 32(c) partially applies to all but SOR \u00b6 1.b. As noted \nabove, Applicant\u2019s toxic and volatile relationship with his wife was replete with incidents \nwhere, because of her mental-health issues, she became routinely enraged at him, \nattacked him, kicked him, pushed him, and lied to investigating sheriff and police \nauthorities, as well as to the courts. It is significant that during the two domestic violence \nincidents involving his wife, Applicant was the passive individual, not the aggressor, who \ncalled for police assistance. The responding sheriff and police authorities were, for the \nmost part, not convinced of her allegations against him, and on at least one occasion, the \ncourt admonished her for abusing the system. As for the PFA violation, it occurred during \na period of attempted reconciliation and did not appear to be an intentional violation by \nApplicant. With respect to the incidents involving his wife, Applicant denied her \nallegations, and he was supported on one occasion by witness statements by his two \nsons, and he was eventually absolved of all charges either by withdrawal of the charges, \nor dismissal of the charges. The PFA and the EPO were both withdrawn or cancelled.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s relationship with his fianc\u00e9e, while being at one time somewhat volatile, \nseems to have become calmer now that she is being treated medically. Her one outburst \nwas instigated by her, with Applicant essentially becoming the victim, notwithstanding the \ndecision of the arresting deputy sheriff who charged them both. The charge against \nApplicant was also dismissed and he was found not guilty. \n \nWith the exception of the most recent incident involving his fianc\u00e9e who testified \nat the hearing, because the police records and court records did not report more than \nsketchy, minimal information regarding those incidents, Applicant became the major \nsource of the information regarding them. His explanations have gone unrebutted. So \nmuch time has elapsed since that alleged criminal behavior happened \u2013 at least five years \nsince the last alleged incident with his wife \u2013 and they happened under such unusual \ncircumstances, it appears that it is unlikely to recur. As far as the more recent similar \n\n \n9 \n                                      \n \nbehavior of conduct, the one involving Applicant\u2019s fianc\u00e9e in 2017, that incident does not \nserve to revalidate the earlier conduct for there is no evidence that he was the aggressor.  \n \nA person should not be held forever accountable for alleged misconduct from the \npast, especially since he appears to be the victim, not the aggressor. While there may be \nsome questions as to Applicant\u2019s wisdom in choosing female companionship, there are \nno concerns about future criminal conduct. Applicant\u2019s past history of alleged criminal \nconduct, under the circumstances, no longer casts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set \nout in AG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \n \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or \ncooperate with security processing, including but not limited \nto meeting with a security investigator for subject interview, \ncompleting security forms or releases, cooperation with \nmedical \nor \npsychological \nevaluation, \nor \npolygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful \nquestions of investigators, security officials, or other official \nrepresentatives in connection with a personnel security or \ntrustworthiness determination. \n \nThe guideline also includes an example of conditions that could raise \ntrustworthiness concerns under AG \u00b6 16: \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information. \n \n\n \n10 \n                                      \n \nMy discussion related to Applicant\u2019s alleged criminal conduct is adopted herein. \nAs to the allegations regarding the alleged personal conduct consisting of the domestic-\nviolence incidents, because of my conclusions that he appears to be the victim, not the \naggressor, all charges against him have been dismissed, and at least one judge \nadmonished Applicant\u2019s wife for abusing the system, AG \u00b6 16(c) has not been \nestablished. The one exception is the violation of the PFA, for which AG \u00b6 16(c) has been \nestablished. Nevertheless, I consider it unlikely that Applicant\u2019s alleged personal conduct, \nespecially the conduct associated with his alleged domestic violence, will recur. \n \nThe guideline also includes one example of a condition under AG \u00b6 17 that could \nmitigate security concerns arising from personal conduct. It is: \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \n \nAs discussed above, the violation of the PFA occurred in March 2007 \u2013 over a \ndecade ago \u2013 during a period of attempted reconciliation with his wife, and that incident \nwas never repeated. In fact, the PFA was eventually withdrawn or cancelled. The \ncircumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s violation of the PFA were rather unique, and it is \nunlikely that such a situation will recur. Accordingly, AG \u00b6 17 (c) has been established. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a position of public trust by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider \nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant \neligibility for a position of public trust must be an overall commonsense judgment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I \nhave evaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record \nevidence and have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis.21  \n                                                          \n21 See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-\n3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006). \n \n\n \n11 \n                                      \n \n \nThere is some evidence against mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct. Because of several \ndisciplinary incidents while in the U.S. Army Reserve three decades ago, he was issued \nan uncharacterized discharge while training. On four occasions between November 2006 \nand April 2017, Applicant was cited or arrested and charged with a variety of crimes, all \nessentially associated with domestic violence. A PFA and an EPO were issued against \nhim. \n \nThe mitigating evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. \nApplicant is a 49-year-old employee of a defense contractor, and he has been serving as \na solution-delivery designer with his current employer since April 2016. He held a \nconfidential clearance in 1988, and he held a secret clearance from 2007 to 2008. During \nthose domestic-violence incidents involving his wife and his fianc\u00e9e, Applicant was the \npassive individual, not the aggressor. He called for police assistance. Applicant denied \nhe was the aggressor, and he was supported on one occasion by witness statements by \nhis two sons, and he was eventually absolved of all charges either by withdrawal of the \ncharges, or dismissal of the charges. The PFA and the EPO were both withdrawn or \ncancelled. On at least one occasion, the court admonished Applicant\u2019s wife for abusing \nthe system. His fianc\u00e9e acknowledged that she was the aggressor during her incident \nwith Applicant.  \n \nOverall, the evidence leaves me without questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a position of public trust. For all of these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant has successfully mitigated the trustworthiness concerns arising from his alleged \ncriminal conduct and personal conduct. See SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d)(1) through AG \n2(d)(9). \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.d.:  \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a.:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n\n \n12 \n                                      \n \nConclusion \n \n \n In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a position of public \ntrust to support a contract with the DOD.  Eligibility is granted. \n \n \n                                        \n         \n \n \n \n________________________ \nROBERT ROBINSON GALES \nAdministrative Judge \n",

On May 23, 2018, DOHA issued a notice of hearing, setting the hearing for June 13, \n2018. (HE 1) Applicant\u2019s hearing was held as scheduled. On June 21, 2018, DOHA \nreceived the hearing transcript. \n \nOn November 27, 2018, I issued a decision denying Applicant\u2019s access to \nclassified information.  On March 12, 2019, the DOHA Appeal Board remanded the case \nto me and directed collection of four documents that Applicant presented during the \nhearing. At the hearing, the content of the four documents was summarized on the record, \nand the documents were returned to Applicant. The Appeal Board did not ask me to take \nany action beyond collection of the four documents.    \n \nOn March 14, 2019, I asked Applicant to provide copies of the exhibits referenced \nin the transcript at pages 18-21, and I provided a copy of the Appeal Board decision. \n(Remand Exhibit 1 with two attachments).  Applicant provided the requested documents, \nand they are as follows: \n \n(1) February 8, 2018 letter from bank creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.d, indicating the balance \nowed is $1,141 and showing a payment of $315.79 (RE 2 (1 page)); \n \n(2) November 15, 2009 lease quote and two pages from an apartment lease for an \napartment, signed by Applicant on November 15, 2009, with handwritten notes on page \none (RE 3 (3 pages));  \n \n(3) Lease for a different property from December 3, 2010, to December 4, 2011 \n(RE 4 (14 pages)); and  \n \n(4) Letter dated April 3, 2018, for a debt being collected by a creditor for a \nmotorcycle, and the letter shows the non-SOR debt was paid in full or settled in full on \nMarch 21, 2018 (RE 4 (1 page)).  \n \nEmail correspondence indicates receipt of the four documents from Applicant. (RE \n6) The four documents were provided as directed by the Appeal Board. (RE 2-5) \n \nOn April 4, 2019, a copy of my \u201cRemand Order\u201d forwarding the requested \ndocuments to the Appeal Board was sent to Applicant; however, due to an administrative \nerror, the remand order was not date stamped. \n \nOn June 11, 2019, the Appeal Board remanded the case to me for the second time \nasking me to issue a new decision in accordance with Directive \u00b6 E3.1.35. ISCR Case \nNo. 17-03043 (App. Bd. June 11, 2019). A copy of appellate documents the Appeal Board \nconsidered were not provided to me. \n \n\n \n3 \n                                         \n \nSome details were excluded from this decision to protect Applicant\u2019s right to \nprivacy. Specific information is available in the cited exhibits. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s SOR response, she admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through \n1.f. (HE 3) She also provided mitigating information. Her admissions are accepted as \nfindings of fact.  \n \nAt the time of her hearing, Applicant was a 59-year-old specialist in conducting \ninventories who was employed by a government contractor. (Tr. 5-9) In 1976, she \ngraduated from high school. (Tr. 5) She has about two years of college. (Tr. 6) She \nmarried the same man twice, in 1977 and 1984, and they were divorced in 1983 and \n1993. (Tr. 6) She married in 2005 and divorced in 2010. (Tr. 6) Her children are ages 37 \nand 40. (Tr. 6) She adopted her three-year-old granddaughter in 2006, and Applicant had \ncustody of her granddaughter. (Tr. 26-27) She served in the Army from 1976 to 1984; she \nleft active duty as a Specialist 5 (E-5), and she received a general discharge under \nhonorable conditions. (Tr. 7-8) She has been employed by the federal government or a \ngovernment contractor for 41 years. (Tr. 8-9) There is no evidence of security violations.  \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nApplicant received federal civil service retirement pay after July 2014. (Tr. 23-24) \nShe had a period of unemployment from July 2015 to February 2016. (Tr. 22) In 2014, \nshe withdrew $64,000 from her Thrift Savings Account, which increased her tax liability \nin 2014. (Tr. 24) The status of the financial issues alleged in the SOR at the time of her \nhearing were as follows: \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges Applicant failed to timely file her federal income tax returns for \ntax years 2013 through 2015. For tax year 2013, Applicant said she thought that she filed \nher tax return about one week after her extension expired. (Tr. 30) The Internal Revenue \nService (IRS) advised her in 2017, that the IRS had not received her tax return for tax \nyear 2013. (Tr. 50) The IRS recalculated her tax return, and she did not owe any taxes \nfor tax year 2013. She was supposed to receive a refund; however, since her 2013 tax \nreturn was more than three years overdue, the IRS refused to credit her with the refund. \nApplicant said she did not timely file her tax returns because she was distracted by issues \ninvolving her grandchild and children. (Tr. 31) Her son and daughter-in-law are drug \naddicts; her son was incarcerated; and her grandchild was severely injured. (Tr. 31-32) \nHer son is not currently incarcerated; however, her daughter is now in jail. (Tr. 33) She \ndescribed the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) personal subject interview (PSI) \nas \u201ca kick in the rear\u201d to motivate her to file her federal income tax returns. (Tr. 34)  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleges that Applicant owes delinquent federal income taxes for tax \nyears 2013 through 2016. Applicant admitted that she has a debt for unpaid federal \nincome taxes. (Tr. 34) Applicant provided tax transcripts for tax years 2013 through 2016, \nand information from those tax transcripts (GE 2) is depicted in the following table: \n \n\n \n4 \n                                         \n \nTax Year \nDate Tax \nReturns Filed \nAdjusted Gross \nIncome \nTaxes Owed \n2013 \nNov. 2, 2017 \n \n$0 \n2014 \nMay 27, 2017 \n$200,901  \n$8,366 \n2015 \nMay 27, 2017 \n$152,963 \n$1,303 \n2016 \nMay 27, 2017 \n$183,545 \n$2,541 \n \nApplicant owes federal income taxes of $1,557 for tax year 2017, and she \nestimated that she owes about $12,500 in total to the IRS. (Tr. 51; January 24, 2018 IRS \nletter) In February 2018, Applicant started making payments in compliance with her $384 \nmonthly payment plan to the IRS. (Tr. 35) Up to the date of her hearing, she had made \nall of her scheduled payments. (Tr. 35-38) \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d allege a charged-off debt for $1,434 and a debt placed for \ncollection for $1,272 owed to the same creditor. On February 8, 2018, the creditor wrote \nthanking Applicant for payment of $315 and stating the current balance owed is $1,141. \n(Tr. 19) She conceded she \u201cblew them off\u201d and failed to make payments for several years. \n(Tr. 41) At the time of her hearing, she planned to continue to make payments until the \ndebt is resolved. (Tr. 41) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e alleges a charged-off bank debt for $508. In her SOR response, \nApplicant said she intended to make two $254 payments in March 2018. At her hearing, \nshe conceded that she did not get around to making the payments to resolve this debt. \n(Tr. 41-42) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f alleges a debt owed to Applicant\u2019s landlord for $4,223 which was placed \nfor collection. On November 15, 2009, Applicant signed a one-year lease in which she \nagreed to pay $1,985 monthly for an apartment. (Tr. 19-20) She said she disputed her \nresponsibility for this debt. (SOR response) She did not provide a copy of the \ncorrespondence disputing the debt. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.g alleges a utility debt placed for collection for $123. Applicant said the \ncreditor agreed she did not owe the debt because it was paid in June 2015. (Tr. 42; SOR \nresponse) She asked the creditor to provide updated information to the credit reporting \ncompanies. (Tr. 42) The debt does not appear as delinquent on her February 2, 2018 \nTransUnion, Equifax, and Experian credit reports. (SOR response) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.h alleges Applicant owes a past-due amount of $294 on a debt for $5,104. \nHer SOR response indicated the balance owed is $4,326, and the account is current. \nApplicant\u2019s February 2, 2018 credit reports indicate the balance is $4,479, and her \npayment is 30 days past due in the amount of $92. (February 2, 2018 TransUnion credit \nreport at 29; February 2, 2018 Equifax credit report at 24; Experian credit report at 29) \nApplicant said her payments on this credit card debt are current. (Tr. 42-43) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.i alleges Applicant is past due $343 on a debt for $5,003. The debt relates \nto Applicant\u2019s 2005 vehicle. (Tr. 43) In December 2017, shortly after her son was released \nfrom jail, he wrecked Applicant\u2019s vehicle; it did not have insurance; and it is in Applicant\u2019s \n\n \n5 \n                                         \n \ngarage. (Tr. 43-46) The account is now $964 past due. (Tr. 43) At her hearing, she said \nshe planned to pay off the debt. (Tr. 44)  \n \nOn March 21, 2018, Applicant paid a debt for $16,829 originally owed to a \nmotorcycle company. (Tr. 20, 28) With employer matching, she is contributing $1,600 \nmonthly into a retirement plan. (Tr. 38) \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \n\n \n6 \n                                         \n \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his or her security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility.  \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 19 includes three disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts\u201d; \u201c(c) a history of not \nmeeting financial obligations\u201d; and \u201c(f) failure to file . . . annual Federal . . . income tax \nreturns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required.\u201d The record \nestablishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), and 19(f).   \n\n \n7 \n                                         \n \n Seven financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable in this case:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;   \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue;  \n \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nThe DOHA Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving \nthe applicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  \n\n \n8 \n                                         \n \nApplicant provided some mitigating information. She was unemployed from July \n2015 to February 2016. Her children became addicted to illegal drugs, and she needed \nto adopt her grandchild. Her son wrecked her vehicle. She was divorced. These \ncircumstances were beyond her control and adversely affected her finances. She is \ncredited with mitigating the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, 1.g, and 1.h. She resolved some \nnon-SOR debts, including a large debt relating to a motorcycle, and she made payments \nto address some other debts.    \n \nApplicant did not act responsibly under the circumstances when she failed to: (1) \nmake payments on the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 1.f, and 1.i; and (2) timely file her federal \nincome returns for tax years 2013, 2014, and 2015. The failure to timely file tax returns is \nparticularly problematic. \n \nA willful failure to timely make (means complete and file with the IRS) a federal \nincome tax return is a misdemeanor-level federal criminal offense. Title 26 U.S.C, \u00a7 7203, \nwillful failure to file return, supply information, or pay tax, reads:  \n \nAny person . . . required by this title or by regulations made under authority \nthereof to make a return, keep any records, or supply any information, who \nwillfully fails to . . .  make such return, keep such records, or supply such \ninformation, at the time or times required by law or regulations, shall, in \naddition to other penalties provided by law, be guilty of a misdemeanor . . .  \n \nA willful failure to make tax return, keep records, or supply information when \nrequired, is a misdemeanor without regard to existence of any tax liability. Spies v. United \nStates, 317 U.S. 492 (1943); United States v. Walker, 479 F.2d 407 (9th Cir. 1973); United \nStates v. McCabe, 416 F.2d 957 (7th Cir. 1969); O\u2019Brien v. United States, 51 F.2d 193 (7th \nCir. 1931).  \n \nFor purposes of this decision, I am not weighing Applicant\u2019s failure to timely file her \nfederal income tax returns against her as a federal crime. The failure to timely file income \ntax returns has security implications because: \n \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established governmental rules and systems. Voluntary \ncompliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002). As we \nhave noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is not directed at collecting \ndebts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By \nthe same token, neither is it directed toward inducing an applicant to file tax \nreturns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s \njudgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her \nlegal obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment \nand reliability required of those granted access to classified information. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). See \nCafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, \n183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). \n\n \n9 \n                                         \n \nISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016) (emphasis in original). See ISCR \nCase No. 14-05476 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002)); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015).  \n \nThe Appeal Board clarified that even in instances where an \u201c[a]pplicant has \npurportedly corrected [his or her] federal tax problem, and the fact that [applicant] is now \nmotivated to prevent such problems in the future, does not preclude careful consideration \nof [a]pplicant\u2019s security worthiness in light of [his or her] longstanding prior behavior \nevidencing irresponsibility\u201d including a failure to timely file federal income tax returns. See \nISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 3 and n. 3 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) (characterizing \u201cno harm, \nno foul\u201d approach to an Applicant\u2019s course of conduct and employing an \u201call\u2019s well that \nends well\u201d analysis as inadequate to support approval of access to classified information \nwith focus on timing of filing of tax returns after receipt of the SOR).   \n \nApplicant did not give good enough reasons for not timely filing her federal income \ntax returns for tax years 2013, 2014, and 2015. She knew she needed to timely file those \nfederal income tax returns, and she did not show the requisite diligence in filing those tax \nreturns. She did not make sufficient progress resolving the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 1.f, and \n1.i in light of her income from her current employment. There is insufficient assurance \nthat similar problems will not recur in the future. Under all the circumstances, she failed \nto establish mitigation of financial considerations security concerns. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n     \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \n \nAt the time of her hearing, Applicant was a 59-year-old specialist in conducting \ninventories. She has about two years of college. Her children are ages 37 and 40. She \nadopted her three-year-old granddaughter in 2006, and Applicant has custody of her. She \n\n \n10 \n                                         \n \nserved in the Army from 1976 to 1984; she left active duty as a Specialist 5 under \nhonorable conditions. She has been employed by the federal government or a \ngovernment contractor for 41 years. She received federal civil service retirement after \nJuly 2014.  \n \nApplicant provided some important mitigating information. Her finances were \nadversely affected by circumstances beyond her control. She resolved several debts and \nmade sufficient payments on others to establish payment plans.   \n \nThe evidence against mitigation is more persuasive. For three years she has \nreceived significant income. She did not make sufficient progress resolving three of her \nSOR debts: SOR \u00b6 1.e for about $508; SOR \u00b6 1.f for $4,223; and SOR \u00b6 1.i for $5,003.    \n \nBased on the decisions of the DOHA Appeal Board, the evidence against grant of \na security clearance outweighs the positive evidence of her background and financial \nresponsibility. When a tax issue is involved, an administrative judge is required to \nconsider how long an applicant waits to file his or her tax returns, whether the IRS \ngenerates the tax returns, and how long the applicant waits after a tax debt arises to begin \nand complete making payments. \n \nThe emphasis of the Appeal Board on security concerns arising from tax cases is \ninstructive. See ISCR Case No. 14-05794 at 7 (App. Bd. July 7, 2016) (reversing grant of \nsecurity clearance and stating, \u201cHis delay in taking action to resolve his tax deficiency for \nyears and then taking action only after his security clearance was in jeopardy undercuts \na determination that Applicant has rehabilitated himself and does not reflect the voluntary \ncompliance of rules and regulations expected of someone entrusted with the nation\u2019s \nsecrets.\u201d); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 2-6 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015) (reversing grant of \na security clearance, discussing lack of detailed corroboration of circumstances beyond \napplicant\u2019s control adversely affecting finances, noting two tax liens totaling $175,000 and \ngarnishment of Applicant\u2019s wages, and emphasizing the applicant\u2019s failure to timely file \nand pay taxes); ISCR Case No. 12-05053 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 30, 2014) (reversing grant \nof a security clearance, noting not all tax returns filed, and insufficient discussion of \nApplicant\u2019s efforts to resolve tax liens).  \n \nMore recently, in ISCR Case No. 14-05476 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016) the Appeal \nBoard reversed a grant of a security clearance for a retired E-9 and cited his failure to \ntimely file state tax returns for tax years 2010 through 2013 and federal returns for tax \nyears 2010 through 2012. Before his hearing, he filed his tax returns and paid his tax \ndebts except for $13,000, which was in an established payment plan. The Appeal Board \nhighlighted his annual income of over $200,000 and discounted his non-tax expenses, \ncontributions to DOD, expenditures for his children\u2019s private college tuition and expenses, \nand spouse\u2019s medical problems. The Appeal Board emphasized \u201cthe allegations \nregarding his failure to file tax returns in the first place stating, it is well settled that failure \nto file tax returns suggest that an applicant has a problem with complying with well-\nestablished government rules and systems. Voluntary compliance with such rules and \nsystems is essential for protecting classified information.\u201d Id. at 5 (citing ISCR Case No. \n01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002) (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). \n\n \n11 \n                                         \n \nSee also ISCR Case No. 14-03358 at 3, 5 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2015) (reversing grant of a \nsecurity clearance, noting $150,000 owed to the federal government, and stating \u201cA \nsecurity clearance represents an obligation to the Federal Government for the protection \nof national secrets. Accordingly failure to honor other obligations to the Government has \na direct bearing on an applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified information.\u201d). An applicant\u2019s uncorroborated statements that all tax returns \nwere filed is insufficient to prove tax returns were actually filed. See ISCR Case No. 15-\n06440 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 26, 2017) (citing e.g., ISCR Case No. 96-0897 at 2-3 (App. Bd. \nDec. 9, 1997) and reversing grant of security clearance).  \n \nIn this case, there is no evidence that the IRS generated her tax returns. She did \nnot file her tax returns for tax years 2013, 2014, and 2015 until 2017. The primary problem \nhere is that Applicant has known that she needed to file federal income tax returns for \nseveral years. She had a legal requirement to timely file her tax returns. Her actions raise \nunmitigated questions about Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified information. See AG \u00b6 18.  \n \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or renewal of a \nsecurity clearance. See Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. Unmitigated financial considerations \nconcerns lead me to conclude that grant of a security clearance to Applicant is not \nwarranted at this time. This decision should not be construed as a determination that \nApplicant cannot or will not attain the state of reform necessary for award of a security \nclearance in the future. With more of a track record of behavior consistent with her \nobligations, Applicant may well be able to demonstrate persuasive evidence of her \nsecurity clearance worthiness.  \n \nI have carefully considered the entire record, including the documents admitted \ninto the record at the direction of the Appeal Board. I have applied the law, as set forth in \nEgan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the \ncontext of the whole person. Financial consideration security concerns are not mitigated.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n  \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT  \n \nSubparagraph 1.a, 1.e, 1.f, and 1.i: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, 1.g, and 1.h: \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n\n \n12 \n                                         \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility \nfor access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n_________________________ \nMark Harvey \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Foreman, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nGregg A. Cervi, Administrative Judge \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct). Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA)1 on May 18, 2015. On \nOctober 24, 2017, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD \nCAF) sent him a statement of reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guidelines \nF and E.2 Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing. \n1 Also known as a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF86). \n2 The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) effective on June 8, 2017. \n03/11/2019\n\n \n2 \n \nThe case was assigned to me on June 18, 2018. The Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on July 31, 2018, scheduling the hearing \nfor August 28, 2018. The hearing was convened as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GE) \n1 and 2 and Applicant Exhibit (AE) A were admitted in evidence without objection. The \nGovernment submitted a request I take administrative notice of certain relevant Internal \nRevenue Service (IRS) statutes and regulations. The request was marked as Hearing \nExhibit (HE) I and admitted into the record. Applicant testified. The record was held open \nto permit Applicant to submit additional documentary evidence in mitigation. E-mails and \ndocuments marked as AE B and C were submitted and admitted without objection. DOHA \nreceived the hearing transcript (Tr.) on September 6, 2018. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 55-year-old senior systems engineer, employed by a defense \ncontractor since 2013. He worked for previous defense contractors since about 2003. He \ngraduated from high school in 1981. He married in 1984 and divorced in 1986. He married \nagain in 2010, and has one adult child. Applicant has held a security clearance since \n2003. \n \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline F, that Applicant failed to file Federal income \ntax returns for tax years 2005-2009 and 2011. The SOR also alleges under Guideline E, \nthat Applicant failed to disclose that his 2008 and 2009 tax returns were not filed when he \ncompleted his 2015 SCA. Applicant admitted the Guideline F allegation with explanations, \nand denied the Guideline E allegation, stating that he did not deliberately fail to disclose \nthe information. The Guideline F SOR allegation is supported by substantial evidence, \nbut the Guideline E allegation is unfounded. \n \nApplicant reported in his SCA, that he worked as a civilian contractor in Iraq from \n2005 to 2010 in support of U.S. Armed Forces. He left Iraq in March 2010, and remained \nunemployed until he began working in Afghanistan in November 2010 to March 2011.3 \nHe worked in Macedonia from March 2011 to February 2012, when he returned to the \nUnited States. Applicant was required to file Federal income tax returns,4 however while \nin a combat zone or contingency operation area under IRS rules,5 he received automatic \nextensions to file Federal tax returns until the expiration of 180 days after leaving the \ncombat zone or contingency operation area.6 \n \nAfter leaving the combat zone area in 2011, Applicant did not file his Federal \nincome tax returns for the tax years while deployed, because of distractions caused by \nsearching for a new job, arranging the immigration needs for his foreign-born spouse, and \n                                                     \n3 Applicant testified that he worked in Iraq and Afghanistan continuously from 2003 to 2011. \n \n4 See, Title 26, Internal Revenue Code, section 6012 at HE I. \n \n5 IRS Pub. 3, Armed Forces Tax Guide, at 28 (2017). Filing extensions apply to civilian personnel in support \nof the Armed Forces serving in a combat zone or a contingency operation. \n \n6 IRS Pub. 3, p. 29 at AE B. \n\n \n3 \n \nmoving his family to two different states within six months. After he filed his 2012 Federal \ntax return on time in April 2013, he stated that the IRS notified him about his unfiled tax \nreturns. He maintained continuous contact with the IRS thereafter and filed the returns he \nwas instructed to file. He stated that he was instructed over the phone on several \noccasions, to file his 2010 tax return, which he signed on January 6, 2013, and received \nby the IRS on June 18, 2013, but was instructed not to file the remaining unfiled returns \n(2005 to 2009 and 2011). He indicated that the IRS was applying a three-year look-back \nperiod for any refunds owed to the taxpayer, and a six-year look-back period for any taxes \nowed to the IRS. \n \nInternal Revenue Service tax transcripts in evidence show the following: \n \nTax year 2005 \u2013 IRS suspended collection of taxes due to military \ndeferment in October 2005; inquiry for non-filing of the tax return issued in \nJuly 2007; removed suspension of tax collection in April 2011; issued a \nnotice in May 2011; no tax return was filed. The transcript shows a zero \naccount balance and no information on income, tax paid, or tax owed. \n \nTax year 2006 \u2013 inquiry for non-filing tax return issued in November 2007; \nnotice issued in May 2011; no tax return was filed. The transcript shows a \nzero account balance and no information on income, tax paid, or tax owed. \n \nTax year 2007 \u2013 inquiry for non-filing of tax return issued in November 2008; \nnotice issued in May 2011; no tax return was filed. The transcript shows a \nzero account balance and no information on income, tax paid, or tax owed. \n \nTax year 2008 \u2013 inquiry for non-filing of tax return issued in December 2009; \nnotice issued in May 2011; no tax return was filed. The transcript shows a \nzero account balance and no information on income, tax paid, or tax owed. \n \nTax year 2009 \u2013 inquiry for non-filing of tax return issued in November 2010; \nnotice issued in May 2011; no tax return was filed. The transcript shows a \nzero account balance and no information on income, tax paid, or tax owed. \n \nTax year 2010 \u2013inquiry for non-filing of tax return issued in December 2011; \nnotice issued in December 2012; tax return received on June 18, 2013; \nsubstitute tax return prepared by IRS in July 8, 2013; additional account \naction pending noted in July 2013; final notice before tax is determined by \nIRS issued in September 2013; resolved tax determination in January 2014; \nW-2 withholding was $14,325; additional tax assessed of $17,094 in \nFebruary 2014; penalty for filing tax return after the due date, interest and \npenalties charged February 2014; examination of tax return in April 2014; \ncredit transferred from tax years 2013 and 2014 tax refunds applied in 2014 \nand 2015.  \n \n\n \n4 \n \nIn August 2014, Applicant received an IRS notice of a balance of $8,555 was due \nfor tax year 2010. He filed a petition in 2015 in the United States Tax Court challenging \nthe deficiency amount. In May 2015, Applicant and the IRS settled the case with a ruling \nthat no deficiency or additional tax was due for tax year 2010.  Applicant agreed to pay \nthe $3,376 balance owed, which he paid in July 2017. The tax year 2010 transcript shows \na zero balance. \n \nTax returns for tax years 2012 to 2017 were filed on time and no tax is owed. \nApplicant re-contacted the IRS by phone after the hearing, and confirmed that he was in \nfull compliance with IRS instructions, and that they did not require him to file any of the \nunfiled tax returns. The IRS representatives contacted would not provide a written \nconfirmation. \n \nWhen Applicant completed his 2015 SCA, he was asked in section 26, to list \nwhether \u201cin the past seven years, have you failed to file or pay Federal, state, or other \ntaxes when required by law or ordinance?\u201d He responded \u201cyes,\u201d and stated that he failed \nto file his 2009 return: \n \n\u201cdue to working overseas in a war zone, I was not required to file until \npermanent return to the states from working in said war zone. I had not filed \nin a timely manner for several of those years, but have been working with \nthe IRS to get all returns filed. 2009 is the only one outstanding at this time, \nthough we are still working through 2010 at present.\u201d \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant stated that 2008 tax return was not listed \nbecause he did correctly count back seven years, rather he thought 2009 was the first \nyear to report. Also, since the IRS told him he did not have to file the 2011 return, he did \nnot think to list it as a failure to file a tax return. He acknowledged these errors, but noted \nthat he listed 2009, which was pending at the time, and did not intentionally or willfully fail \nto list his 2008 and 2011 tax returns. \n \nApplicant is financially stable. He and his spouse earn over $112,000 per year and \nreported a monthly net remainder of over $2,000 after paying expenses. He has no \ndelinquent debt, a paid mortgage, and about $76,000 in other assets. \n \nLaw and Policies \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \nNational security eligibility is predicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria \ncontained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. \nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies \nthese guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider a person\u2019s stability, trustworthiness, reliability, \ndiscretion, character, honesty, and judgment. AG \u00b6 1(b). \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865  \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-01295 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2015). \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition,  \n \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01- \n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see, AG \u00b6 1(d). \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . .  \n \nThe relevant disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19 include: \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence are sufficient to establish \nthe disqualifying condition above. \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially relevant: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nApplicant failed to file tax several years of tax returns when his extensions expired \nafter leaving the combat or contingency zone. He did not meet his obligation to file tax \nreturns when due. After he filed his 2012 return in 2013, he began a multi-year \n\u201cdiscussion\u201d with the IRS over which unfiled tax returns were required to be filed. It was \ndetermined that he owed an additional tax for tax year 2010, and that he should not bother \nto file returns for 2005 to 2009, and 2011. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \nThe Appeal Board has long held: \n \nSecurity requirements include consideration of a person\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, and a sense of his or her legal obligations. Cafeteria & Restaurant \nWorkers Union, Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), \naff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). Failure to comply with Federal tax laws suggests \nthat an applicant has a problem with abiding by well-established \ngovernment rules and regulations. Voluntary compliance with rules and \nregulations is essential for protecting classified information. See, e.g., \nISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016). \n \nApplicant\u2019s complicated tax odyssey arose because of multiple years of work in a \ncombat zone that triggered automatic extensions to file Federal tax returns, and his failure \nto follow-up on required returns before his extensions expired. He resumed filing his 2012 \ntax return when due, and filed all subsequent returns on time, while diligently \ncommunicating with the IRS about filing his past-due returns. The matter was settled to \nthe satisfaction of the IRS, he filed his 2012 to 2017 returns on time, and he has no unpaid \nFederal tax obligations. \n \nOverall, I find that Applicant has adequately addressed his delinquent tax return \nobligations, and has established a six-year track record of on-time filings. I find sufficient \nevidence that his financial status and tax obligations are under control, and that similar \nproblems are unlikely to recur. I find mitigating conditions AG \u00b6 20 (a) and (g) apply. \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \n \n  \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \n  \nWhen falsification allegations are controverted, as here, the Government has the \nburden of proving the allegations. An omission, standing alone, does not prove \n\n \n8 \n \nfalsification. An administrative judge must consider the record evidence as a whole to \ndetermine an applicant\u2019s state of mind at the time of the omission.7 An applicant\u2019s level \nof education and business experience are relevant to determining whether a failure to \ndisclose relevant information on a security clearance application was deliberate.8 \n \n  \nApplicant failed to report unfiled tax returns for tax years 2008 and 2011 in his 2015 \nSCA, but listed his unfiled 2009 return and discussed the work he was doing to file his \n2010 return. The evidence is insufficient to show that Applicant deliberately or \nintentionally failed to report these unfiled tax returns. He adequately refuted the allegation \nand convincingly showed that his failure to report the 2009 return was an error in \ncalculation; rather he listed 2009. Additionally, he stated that his failure to report his 2011 \nunfiled return resulted from his understanding that it was not considered past-due by the \nIRS. These are plausible explanations for his omissions on his SCA, and intentional \nfalsification is not supported by the evidence. AG \u00b6 16(a) is not applicable. Personal \nconduct security concerns are concluded for Appellant. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a), 2(c), and 2(d), the ultimate determination of whether to grant \nnational security eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Under the whole-person \nconcept, the administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d).9 Although adverse information concerning a single criterion \nmay not be sufficient for an unfavorable eligibility determination, the individual may be \nfound ineligible if available information reflects a recent or recurring pattern of \nquestionable judgment, irresponsibility, or unstable behavior. AG \u00b6 2(e). \n \nI considered all of the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nall the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my findings of \nfact and comments under Guidelines F and E in my whole-person analysis. Applicant\u2019s \nefforts to resolve his tax-filing obligations satisfactorily complied with IRS directions. He \nhas shown a six-year tax filing record, and has no further IRS obligations. Applicant \ncarried his burden of proof to establish substantial mitigation. The personal conduct \nallegation is unfounded. \n \n                                                     \n7 See ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004). \n \n8 ISCR Case No. 08-05637 (App. Bd. Sep. 9, 2010). \n \n9 (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to \ninclude knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age \nand maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence \nor absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n\n \n9 \n \nAccordingly, I conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national security \ninterests of the United States to grant or continue eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:   \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.

Foreman, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nCERVI, Gregg A., Administrative Judge \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guidelines E (Personal \nConduct), K (Handling Protected Information), and M (Use of Information Technology). \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on November 11, 2014. \nOn November 27, 2017, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under \nGuidelines E, K, and M.1 \nApplicant responded to the SOR on December 15, 2017, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on June 18, 2018. The \n1 The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines \n(AG) effective on June 8, 2017. \n02/15/2019\n\n \n2 \n \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued a notice of hearing on August 1, 2018, \nand the hearing was convened on August 29, 2018. Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through \n4 were admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant testified at the hearing, but did \nnot introduce any documentary evidence. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on \nSeptember 7, 2018. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 63-year-old contracts manager for a defense contractor, employed \nsince 2014. He previously worked for another defense contractor from 2009 until he was \nlaid off in 2013. Applicant received a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1980. He married in 1982 and \nhas two adult children. He held a DOD security clearance for 30 years before he was laid \noff in 2013. \n \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline E that Applicant copied company proprietary \nfiles after being notified that he was selected for layoff. When confronted, he denied \nhaving the files, until he admitted copying them after repeated questioning. Applicant also \nfalsified material facts presented to a Government investigator regarding this incident. \nThe incident described in SOR \u00b6 1.a is cross-alleged under Guidelines K and M. In his \nAnswer to the SOR, Applicant denied intentionally copying the 661 files, and that it was \nnot his intent to do so. Rather, he intended to copy examples of his work for use in finding \nanother job, as he was in a \u201cpanic mode.\u201d He noted that he had permission to work from \nhome and that the Government investigator was \u201cmisleading.\u201d The Government\u2019s \nevidence is sufficient to establish the SOR allegations. \n \nOn August 1, 2013, Applicant was notified that he was selected for layoff. He was \nnotified not to have contact with company customers during the transition. The company \nbegan to monitor his work computer. Subsequently, Applicant removed three boxes from \nthe office and composed an email to the contracts team and copied the customer. On \nSunday, August 4, 2013, Applicant accessed the company computer system remotely, \ndeleted certain data and copied 661 files to his personal thumb drive. The files were \ncontract related information, including sensitive company financial information and \nproprietary information including contracts, contract negotiation information, and attorney \nwork-product. \n \nOn August 8, 2013, Applicant met with company human resources and security \npersonnel. He signed several statements affirming that he was not in possession of \ncompany proprietary information and electronic media. He was asked three times if he \nhad any company data in his possession, and Applicant denied it each time. The fourth \ntime, he admitted he may have information he copied for the transition. When the list of \n661 files was presented to him, he admitted he had copied the files for \u201creference\u201d \npurposes. He returned the thumb drive as directed. \n \nWhen interviewed by a Government investigator in 2015, Applicant claimed he \ncopied files with his supervisor\u2019s permission over a period of time to a company thumb \ndrive and he was unaware of making any false statements to company personnel. \n\n \n3 \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, he generally denied any wrongdoing with regard \nto copying documents, and claimed the Government investigator was \u201cmisleading.\u201d He \nstated that he was focused on getting his job done, and when he lost use of a company \nissued thumb drive, he used his personal thumb drive, and he did not remember that until \nhe was confronted with specifics. He apologized for his actions and stated that \u201cwhat I did \nafter I lost my job was really stupid, and the only excuse I can offer is my state of mind at \nthe time.\u201d \n \nDuring the hearing in this case, Applicant admitted that he did things he should not \nhave, including taking company documents that were useful to his new job and was \ndeceptive to the company. However, Applicant also testified that the he did not take files \nfor an improper purpose and denied having company proprietary information. When \nquestioned, he admitted having company foreign contracts and attorney-client \ninformation. He also stated that he forgot the thumb drive was in his possession when \nconfronted by the company, and claimed that he copied documents routinely as part of \nhis work, but could not remember if he had a company laptop or a way to connect to the \ncompany computer system when away from work. He has not sought counseling to \naddress this issue. \n \nPolicies \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \n \nNational security eligibility is predicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria \ncontained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. \nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies \nthese guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider a person\u2019s stability, trustworthiness, reliability, \ndiscretion, character, honesty, and judgment. AG \u00b6 1(b). \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \n \n\n \n4 \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865  \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-01295 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2015). \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01- \n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see, AG \u00b6 1(d). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline E; Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the personal conduct security concern: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case. The following disqualifying condition are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \n\n \n5 \n \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, \nsecurity official, competent medical or mental health professional involved \nin making a recommendation relevant to a national security eligibility \ndetermination, or other official government representative; \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may \nnot properly safeguard protected information. This includes but is not limited \nto consideration of: \n \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client \nconfidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized \nrelease of sensitive corporate or other government protected \ninformation . . .;  \n \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other employer\u2019s \ntime or resources; and \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes:  \n \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing; \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case. The personal conduct alleged is generally sufficient to implicate \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 16 (a), (b), (d), and (e). \n \nGuideline E includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising from \npersonal conduct. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 and \nfound that none are fully applicable in this case.  \nI find that Applicant willfully copied 661 company documents without permission, \nand repeatedly lied to his employer before returning them. He also lied and was vague \nwhen answering questions related to this incident when interviewed by a Government \ninvestigator and when testifying at his hearing in this case. Applicant has not fully \n\n \n6 \n \napologized, but he continues to equivocate about his intent and the substance of the \ncopied documents. He intentionally failed to cooperate when confronted by the company \nor Government investigator, and gave false and evasive answers. He has not sought \ncounseling. Based on Applicant\u2019s significant loss of judgment, secretive nature of his \nactions, and failure to admit his possession of the files, even after being confronted, \naffirms his questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty and unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations. I am not convinced that this incident is behind him or that \nsimilar intentional conduct will not recur. No mitigation fully applies. \nGuideline K: Handling Protected Information \nAG \u00b6 33 expresses the handling protected information security concern: \nDeliberate or negligent failure to comply with rules and regulations for \nhandling protected information-which includes classified and other sensitive \ngovernment information, and proprietary information-raises doubt about an \nindividual\u2019s trustworthiness, judgment, reliability, or willingness and ability \nto safeguard such information, and is a serious security concern. \n \nRelevant conditions that could raise a security concern under AG \u00b6 34 and may be \ndisqualifying include: \n \n(a) deliberate or negligent disclosure of protected information to \nunauthorized persons, including, but not limited to, personal or business \ncontacts, the media, or persons present at seminars, meetings, or \nconferences; \n \n(b) collecting or storing protected information in any unauthorized location; \n \n(c) loading, drafting, editing, storing, transmitting, or otherwise handling \nprotected information, including images, on any unauthorized equipment or \nmedium; and \n \n(g) any failure to comply with rules for the protection of classified or sensitive \ninformation. \n \n \nThe evidence presented is sufficient to raise the security concerns described \nabove.  \n \nGuideline K includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising from \nincidents regarding handling protected information. I have considered all of the mitigating \nconditions under AG \u00b6 35. The findings of fact, discussion and reasoning under Guideline \nE, above, apply equally to the concerns raised under Guideline K, and are incorporated \nherein. I find no mitigating condition under Guideline K is fully applicable to Applicant\u2019s \nconduct. \n \n\n \n7 \n \nGuideline M: Use of Information Technology Systems \n \n \nAG \u00b6 39 expresses the security concern pertaining to use of information \ntechnology systems: \n \nFailure to comply with rules, procedures, guidelines, or regulations \npertaining to information technology systems may raise security concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, calling into question the \nwillingness or ability to properly protect sensitive systems, networks, and \ninformation. \n \nRelevant conditions that could raise a security concern under AG \u00b6 40 and may be \ndisqualifying include: \n \n(d) downloading, storing, or transmitting classified, sensitive, proprietary, or \nother protected information on or to any unauthorized information \ntechnology system;  \n \n(e) unauthorized use of any information technology system; and \n \n(f) introduction, removal, or duplication of hardware, firmware, software, or \nmedia to or from any information technology system when prohibited by \nrules, procedures, guidelines, or regulations or when otherwise not \nauthorized. \n \nThe evidence presented is sufficient to raise the security concerns described \nabove. \n \nGuideline M includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising from \nincidents regarding use of information technology. I have considered all of the mitigating \nconditions under AG \u00b6 35. The findings of fact, discussion and reasoning under Guideline \nE, above, apply equally to the concerns raised under Guideline M, and are incorporated \nherein. I find no mitigating condition under Guideline M is fully applicable to Applicant\u2019s \nconduct. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a), 2(c), and 2(d), the ultimate determination of whether to grant \nnational security eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Under the whole-person \nconcept, the administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d). \n \n\n \n8 \n \nI considered all of the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my findings of fact \nand comments under Guidelines E, K, and M, in my whole-person analysis. I also \nconsidered Applicant\u2019s long history of employment and security eligibility. However, his \nintentional actions to copy protected information for his personal use in another position, \nfalsifying his actions when confronted, and falsifying and equivocating his involvement to \na Government investigator and in his hearing, shows a complete lack of judgment, \nhonesty, and trustworthiness expected of a person entrusted with national security \neligibility. I remain unconvinced that this incident is behind him and will not recur. \n \nAccordingly, I conclude Applicant has not carried his burden of showing that it is \nclearly consistent with the national security interests of the United States to grant him \neligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n  Subparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n   \nParagraph 2, Guideline K:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n  Subparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline M:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n  Subparagraph 3.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nApplicant\u2019s security clearance is denied. \n \n \n   _______________________ \nGregg A.

He was married from 2000 until he divorced in 2002, and he has two adult sons from that relationship. Applicant also has full custody of his minor daughter from another relationship. Applicant has attended some college. (Item 3; Item 6; Response) Applicant experienced problems related to custody issues. Until approximately 2003 or 2004, Applicant and his ex-wife shared joint custody of their two sons, and he paid her $640 a month in child support. At that time, she abandoned their children with Applicant. As a result of the ensuing custody battle, Applicant received full custody of their children, and his ex-wife was ordered to pay $264 in monthly support. Applicant\u2019s arrears were forgiven, because his ex-wife did not make her child-support payments. (Item 6 at 6-8; AE 1; AE 3) Applicant\u2019s daughter was born in 2004. He was unaware that he had a daughter until 2006 when his daughter\u2019s mother notified him. At that time, he was approximately $6,000 in arrears for child support, and he was required to pay $406 a month, plus $204 for arrears.

Applicant \nanswered the SOR on December 28, 2017, and requested a decision on the record \nwithout a hearing. \nOn February 12, 2018, a complete copy of the File of Relevant Material (FORM), \ncontaining six Items, was mailed to Applicant. He received the FORM on April 12, 2018. \nThe FORM notified Applicant that he had an opportunity to file objections and submit \nmaterial in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of his receipt of the FORM. \nApplicant was given an extension, and responded to the FORM on June 15, 2018 with a \nletter (Response) and seven Applicant Exhibits (AE 1-7). The case was assigned to me \non September 14, 2018. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI sent emails to Applicant and Department Counsel on December 3, 2018 and \nasked for clarification regarding the status of the alleged debts, because the most recent \ncredit bureau reports (CBR) did not support the conclusion that the alleged debts had \nbeen resolved. I held the record open until December 11, 2018 for either party to submit \nupdated documentation. \nOn December 11, 2018, Applicant\u2019s counsel sent me an email regarding \nApplicant\u2019s student loans\u2019 status, but did not provide supporting documentation. On \nDecember 12, 2018, I emailed both parties and asked if Applicant\u2019s counsel wished to \nsubmit supporting documentation regarding the student loans\u2019 status, because it was not \nclear from Applicant\u2019s Exhibits if the student loans were deferred or outstanding. \nAdditionally, I noted that the submitted documents did not provide proof of resolution for \nthe debts that no longer appeared in the CBRs. I set a new suspense date of December \n18, 2018 for submission of documentation. \nOn December 18, 2018, Applicant\u2019s counsel sent an email and requested \nadditional time to submit documentation regarding Applicant\u2019s student loan status. He \nalso stated, \u201cAs you and I both know, absent the payment of an account it will not be \nremoved by the credit bureau.\u201d On January 2, 2019, Applicant submitted a letter dated, \nDecember 31, 2018 from one of the companies servicing Applicant\u2019s student loans. This \nletter has been marked as AE 8. The email correspondence has been marked as FORM \nExhibit (FE) I. Items 1 through 6 and AE 1 through 8 are admitted into evidence without \nobjection. \n \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 43 years old and has worked as an assembly-line mechanic for a \ndefense contractor since February 2015. He was married from 2000 until he divorced in \n2002, and he has two adult sons from that relationship. Applicant also has full custody of \nhis minor daughter from another relationship. Applicant has attended some college. (Item \n3; Item 6; Response) \nApplicant experienced problems related to custody issues. Until approximately \n2003 or 2004, Applicant and his ex-wife shared joint custody of their two sons, and he \npaid her $640 a month in child support. At that time, she abandoned their children with \nApplicant. As a result of the ensuing custody battle, Applicant received full custody of their \nchildren, and his ex-wife was ordered to pay $264 in monthly support. Applicant\u2019s arrears \nwere forgiven, because his ex-wife did not make her child-support payments. (Item 6 at \n6-8; AE 1; AE 3) \nApplicant\u2019s daughter was born in 2004. He was unaware that he had a daughter \nuntil 2006 when his daughter\u2019s mother notified him. At that time, he was approximately \n$6,000 in arrears for child support, and he was required to pay $406 a month, plus $204 \nfor arrears. In 2008, he obtained full custody of his daughter, and the court held that any \narrears that existed at that time were waived. (Item 6 at 8-9; AE 2) \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n \n \n \nApplicant also experienced medical issues that negatively affected his finances. In \n2007, Applicant was in an automobile accident and broke both of his legs. He  was\nunemployed from January 2010 to February 2015. During this period, he took classes \nand cared for ill family members and his children. He was supported by his parents and \nstate aid. In June 2016, Applicant started to experience seizures and took a 22-month \nmedical leave of absence from his employer. He was paid approximately 50% of his salary \nfor six months and was unpaid for the next sixteen months. He returned to work in April \n2018. (Item 3 at 11; Item 6 at 2, 3, 12-14; Response; AE 6; AE 7)  \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant has twenty delinquent debts, totaling almost \n$25,000. The debts became delinquent between approximately 2010 and 2016 when he \nwas unemployed. (Item 4; Item 5; Item 6) Applicant admitted to all of the alleged debts in \nhis Answer, with no explanation. In his Response, he claimed most of the debts were \nresolved. To support his claim that many of the non-student loan debts were resolved, he \nprovided three credit bureau reports (CBR). Many of the older debts no longer appear in \nthe 2018 CBRs. (AE 4) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, and 1.h are five government student loan accounts \ntotaling $13,158. They were opened between 2010 and 2012, and they were assigned \nfor government collection in 2016. In his May 2015 SCA, Applicant indicated that he was \nworking to resolve his student loans, and they were all deferred until June 2017. During \nhis October 2016 personal subject interview (PSI), Applicant told the investigator that his \nloans were still deferred and might be forgiven. (Item 4 at 1-2; Item 6 at 14-16)   \nThe alleged delinquent student loan debts appear in a CBR dated August 30, 2017. \n(Item 4) Applicant submitted credit bureau reports (CBR) from each of the credit bureaus, \nall of which were dated June 12, 2018. (AE 4) In these CBRs, Applicant appears to have \nmore than five student loans, and the student loans alleged in the SOR remain delinquent. \nThere are several additional student loans that appear as deferred by two companies that \nservice both private and federal student loans. Applicant submitted a letter dated \nDecember 2018, from one of these companies. The letter indicated that all of Applicant\u2019s \nloans in \u201cGroup G\u201d are in forbearance status until March 2019. It is unclear from the letter \nwhich of his alleged student loans are included in the forbearance program. The letter \ndoes not list the loans or the amounts placed in forbearance.1 Additionally, the account \nnumbers and balances listed in Item 4 are inconsistent with the account numbers and \nbalances listed in AE 4. It is unclear from the record evidence how many student loans \nApplicant has and which are deferred or are in forbearance. (Item 4; AE 4; AE 8) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 1.f, 1.g, 1.i, 1.j, 1.k, 1.m, 1.n, 1.o, 1.p, 1.q, 1.r, 1.s, and 1.t are all \ndelinquent medical debts totaling $11,175. They became delinquent between 2011 and \n2014. SOR \u00b6 1.l is a $117 delinquent phone account. (Item 4; Item 5)  \n1 The December 2018 letter submitted by Applicant lists only one account. His counsel submitted an email \nclaiming all of the delinquent student loans are included in forbearance, but did not provide detailed \ndocumentation to support his assertions.

The three debts appear as delinquent in \nAE 4, and their combined current outstanding balance is $1,252. (Item 4; Item 5; Equifax \nat 32-33; Transunion at 13; Experian at 2) Applicant did not provide proof of payment or \nresolution of the other alleged non-student loan debts. His counsel stated that debts are \nremoved by credit agencies when they are paid. However, debts may no longer appear \non credit reports for a variety of reasons: the debt may be beyond the seven-year \nreporting period; the creditor has taken a loss on the debt; a new creditor may have \npurchased the debt; or the debt was paid. \nApplicant submitted a pay stub and a budget worksheet. According to the \ndocumentation, his income exceeds his monthly expenses. (AE 5) He also submitted 11 \nletters of recommendation from family members and others who have worked with him \nand known him for many years. Several of these individuals hold or have held DOD \nsecurity clearances. They describe Applicant as trustworthy, reliable, honest, responsible, \ndependable, and ambitious. (AE 7)  \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d2 As Commander in Chief, the \nPresident has the authority to \u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security \nand to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such \ninformation.\u201d3 The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to \ngrant applicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d4 \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining \nEligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position \n(AG). These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these guidelines in \nconjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An administrative judge \nmust consider all available and reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible  \n2 Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). \n3  Egan at 527. \n4 EO 10865 \u00a7 2. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nAdverse clearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and \nshall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d5 Thus, \na decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has not met \nthe strict guidelines the President and the Security Executive Agent have established for \nissuing national security eligibility. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR.6 \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than \na scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d7 The guidelines presume a nexus, or rational \nconnection, between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed therein and an \napplicant\u2019s security suitability.8 Once the Government establishes a disqualifying \ncondition, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.9 An applicant has the burden of proving a potential mitigating condition, and the \nburden of disproving it never shifts to the Government.10 \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d11 \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d12 \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern under Guideline F is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \n5 EO 10865 \u00a7 7. \n6 Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. \n7 See v.

Dec. 19, 2002); Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. \n12 Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; See also AG \u00b6 2(b). \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . .   \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and his credit reports establish two disqualifying conditions \nunder this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d), and AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of \nnot meeting financial obligations\u201d).  \nAG \u00b6 20 describes conditions that could mitigate those security concerns. The \nfollowing are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nOver the years, Applicant has experienced several personal and professional \nsetbacks that were beyond his control. His medical debt and student loans are not \nexamples of reckless or irresponsible spending, or poor financial habits. However, he still \nhas a responsibility to pay debts that he incurred, and he failed to meet his burden of \nproduction and persuasion to show he paid the debts as he claimed. There is no record \nevidence that he has made payments toward the alleged debts. Applicant argued that the \ninformation in the CBRs should be interpreted in a manner most favorable to him. \nHowever, it is unclear if the student loans alleged in the SOR are currently deferred or if \nthey are in default. \nApplicant was given ample time and opportunities to provide documentation to \nsupport his claims that he has paid many of the alleged non-student loan debts, but the \nonly documentation he provided was in the form of CBRs. Many of his debts no longer \nappear in the most recent CBRs. However, the absence of a debt from a CBR does not \nprove that the debt has been paid or resolved. As discussed above, debts are removed \nfrom CBRs for a variety of reasons. Because the record lacks of evidence to support \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s claims, he has not demonstrated that he has made a good-faith effort to repay \nhis overdue creditors or resolve his debts.13 \nThere is insufficient evidence to show that his finances are in good standing and \nhe acted responsibly to address numerous delinquent debts. Applicant provided no \nevidence of credit counseling. Mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(a), 20(b), and 20(d) was not \nestablished. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \napplicable guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person. \nAn administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \n\u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under the guideline at issue in my whole-person \nanalysis, and I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions under this guideline, and evaluating all the evidence in the \ncontext of the whole person, including his many glowing letters of recommendation, I \nconclude that Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns at issue. The record lacks \nsufficient evidence to demonstrate that he has resolved the alleged delinquent debts. \nAccordingly, Applicant has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent \nwith the interests of national security of the United States to grant him eligibility for access \nto classified information. \n13  The absence of documentation to corroborate claims of satisfying debts is relevant in deciding whether \nsuch claims should be accepted. ISCR Case No. 98-0419 at 4 (April 30, 1999) In concluding Administrative \nJudge failed to take into account an applicant's failure to provide documentation to support his general \nstatements about his financial interests, the Board noted an applicant reasonably can be expected to have \nor be able to get documentation concerning his financial interests such as income, checking and savings \naccounts, business assets, and accrued retirement funds.

Applicant denied that \nallegation with a lengthy explanation in his Answer to the SOR. In late 2014 or early 2015, \none of the doctors treating Applicant\u2019s mother for cancer advised Applicant that combating \nthe illness could require him to take extended time off from work (his mother had lived \nwith Applicant since she was diagnosed in 2013). The doctor suggested that Applicant \nlook into his employer\u2019s FMLA policy. In January 2015, Applicant requested his \nemployer\u2019s FMLA policy. He was told that the company did not have a FMLA policy yet \nand that the policy was being developed and would be disseminated once it was finalized. \nIn August 2015, Applicant\u2019s mother\u2019s doctors told him that she probably would not survive \nto the end of the year. Therefore, Applicant again asked his employer for an update on \nthe FMLA policy. He was told that the policy was still being developed. (Answer, pp. 1-2.)  \n \nAs a result, Applicant did some research on FMLA procedures and found that such \nprocedures could vary depending on the company. Some allowed employees to work \npart-time, to telework, to use up all personal leave first, or to take off time as needed. The \nonly uniform requirement was a form to be completed by a doctor verifying the need for \nFMLA. In September 2015, Applicant submitted a request to his employer requesting \npersonal leave, bereavement leave, and FMLA leave for the October to December 2015 \ntimeframe to cover whatever situation might arise with his mother. His employer told \n\n3 \n \nApplicant he would need to use up his accrued leave (personal paid time-off or PTO) first \nbefore FMLA would take effect. Applicant responded that that was fine since he had \nample carry-over PTO and holiday time. He asked again about the status of the FMLA \npolicy and was told it was still being developed. (Answer, p. 2.) Applicant elaborated on \nhis Answer at the hearing.  \n \nUnder Guideline F, the December 21, 2017 SOR alleged two delinquent accounts \ntotaling $20,463. Applicant admitted those delinquencies but explained that they were \ncaused by his termination of employment that is the subject the Guideline E allegation. \nHe also answered that those debts have been enrolled in a debt relief and consolidation \nprogram to which he pays $1,200 per month and that those two debts have been resolved. \n(Answer, pp. 3-4.)  \n \nAt the hearing Applicant testified on the subject of the FMLA. He confirmed that \nhis mother\u2019s health was failing in the fall of 2015, and that as her sole caretaker, he \nneeded to make leave arrangements to care for her. Applicant submitted FMLA \npaperwork to his human resources person on October 15, 2015, which included the \nmedical verification form. Those documents informed Applicant that he was eligible for \nFMLA but did not state any periods of FMLA or other periods of leave. (Tr. 33-34; GE 2, \npp. 12-17.) The Out of Office Request submitted by Applicant on October 14, 2015, \nhowever, approved by Applicant\u2019s direct supervisor and by Applicant\u2019s human resources \nmanager on October 15, 2015, approved three types of leave for the period November 2, \n2015 through January 4, 2016: PTO, Bereavement, and FMLA, in that order. (GE 2, p. \n11.) On more than one occasion, Applicant was told by his supervisors, who knew of his \nmother\u2019s condition, to take \u201cas much time as he needed.\u201d (Tr. 43-45, 48, 75-77.)   \n \nOn October 22, 2015, Applicant was home with his mother and a hospice caregiver \npreparing to take his mother to a full-time hospice. During transit, his mother expired. \nApplicant emailed his supervisors that he was in the emergency room and did not know \nhow long he would be there. Applicant did not return to work that day, but he returned on \nthe next day, October 23, 2015. (Tr. 34-35; 82.) He did not tell anyone at work that his \nmother had passed away, and nobody asked. Applicant did not start his leave until \nNovember 2, 2015 (the starting date that was approved on October 15, 2015). He delayed \ntaking his leave, because he was getting the company ready for a security inspection in \nJanuary 2016. (Tr. 35, 45; Answer, p. 2.)  \n \nBefore he started his leave on November 2, 2015, his human resource manager \nasked Applicant on October 26, 2015, to submit a FMLA form for completion. He did so \nthe next day, submitting his previous FMLA form. (Tr. 36; GE 2, p. 6-7.)  On the form, \nApplicant certified that he applied for FMLA to care for his mother\u2019s serious health \ncondition. (GE 2, pp. 12-17.) That form dated October 29, 2015 indicated that Applicant\u2019s \nFMLA request was approved for the period November 2, 2015 to January 4, 2016 (for \n96.33 hours of PTO with the remainder being LWOP (Leave Without Pay) ). One condition \nwas that \u201cWe are requiring you to substitute or use paid leave during your FMLA leave.\u201d \n(GE 2, p. 7.) This was consistent with what Applicant was told by his supervisor in \nSeptember 2015 when he inquired about FMLA. (Answer, p. 2.)  Applicant testified that \n\n4 \n \nhe was not troubled by what he was told in September 2015, because even without FMLA \nhe had more than enough accrued hours of PTO (205 hrs.) to cover the 96.33 hours that \nwas approved for leave, and he was willing to go to LWOP, if needed. He was in a use-\nit-or-lose it status. (Tr. 40-42, 68-69, 73.)  As noted below, however, while on leave \nApplicant never received any communication from his employer that his FMLA had been \napproved. (Tr. 36.) \n \nWhile he was on leave, Applicant\u2019s human resources manager sent him an email \non November 3, 2015, on the company email system along with an October 29, 2015 \nFMLA approval restating that his FMLA leave was approved but that he had to take PTO \nconcurrently with his FMLA leave. Applicant testified, however, that he never received \nthat email. Applicant took his work laptop with him on leave, which he customarily did. \nWhen he first checked his work email on November 3, 2016, he could not access it. So, \nApplicant called his IT department and was told that IT had been directed to disconnect \nhis work email because he was going to be on leave for an extended period and did not \nneed access. Applicant testified that \u201cthat [disconnecting an employee\u2019s email while on \nleave] was just never done.\u201d (Tr. 47-48, 70.) Applicant testified that he did not receive that \nNovember 3, 2015 email or the October 29, 2015 FMLA approval until he received \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s February 22, 2018 discovery letter. (Tr. 36; HE 1.)  \n \nApplicant and his employer maintained email contact while Applicant was on leave \n(albeit now using Applicant\u2019s personal email account). On November 24, 2015, his human \nresources manager asked if Applicant was on track to return to work on January 4, 2016. \nOn November 27, 2015, Applicant replied that he would return to work on January 4, \n2016, and likely sooner. On December 17, 2015, his human resources manager asked if \nApplicant had identified a date for his return. Applicant replied that he would return on the \nmorning of the 23rd (December 23, 2015). (GE 2, p. 9.) \n \nApplicant also received emails from his direct supervisor, who was the chief legal \nofficer and general counsel. On December 10, 2015, Applicant\u2019s direct supervisor emailed \nhim on the subject of \u201cChecking in and Security Team Update.\u201d In that email the \nsupervisor told Applicant about changes to the security team. Applicant was informed that \nhe would fill the position of \u201cPersonnel Security Officer\u201d at the \u201csame level, pay and \nbenefits\u2026.\u201d  The email closes with: \u201cWe can talk more about it when you come back, but \nI did not want you to be shell-shocked by all these changes upon your return.\u201d (AE C, p. \n6.) \n \nOn December 14, 2015, Applicant\u2019s direct supervisor emailed him as follows: \n\u201cPlease see attached Holiday Bonus Letter given in appreciation of your work and \ncontributions this year. Please keep this information confidential. Because this is a \ndiscretionary program, not all employees receive a Holiday bonus.\u201d (AE C, p. 9.) On \nDecember 21, 2015, Applicant emailed his supervisor and asked: \u201cHas my work location \nchanged and if so, where should I set up shop?\u201d The direct supervisor replied the same \nday: \u201cHope you are doing well. Your office is in the same place as you left it\u2026[Your] office \nmay change/shift in the future, but nothing definitive right now.\u201d (AE C, p. 8.) \n \n\n5 \n \nIn roughly the same timeframe that Applicant\u2019s direct supervisor was updating \nApplicant on his bonus, his new employment position, and office location, on December \n21, 2015, (at 3:08 p.m.) the human resources manager emailed Applicant that his direct \nsupervisor wanted to meet with Applicant when he returned to work on December 23, \n2015. (AE C, p. 2.) Later that same afternoon, (at 5:25 p.m.) the human resources \nmanager emailed Applicant that instead of meeting with the direct supervisor on the 23rd, \nthe supervisor instead wanted Applicant to call him on his direct line at 10:00 a.m. on the \n22nd. (AE C, p. 1.) \n \nOn the morning of December 22, 2015, Applicant and his direct supervisor and \nhuman resources manager had a telephone conversation at about 10:00 a.m. The \nessence of that conversation is set forth in an email of the same date to Applicant. The  \ndirect supervisor terminated Applicant effective that day. The grounds for separation \nwere: \u201cThe bases for your separation today include, without limitation, obtaining and \ncontinuing FMLA leave under false and misleading pretenses and an overall failure to \nmaintain accountability to the company.\u201d That email was sent at 11:09 a.m. and attached \na separation agreement. (AE C, p. 12.)  \n \nApplicant testified about the bases for his separation. He reiterated that while he \nwas on leave he did not receive any notification from his employer that his FMLA had \nbeen approved. Applicant was always under the impression that he would be required to \ntake annual (PTO) leave before FMLA \u201cwould kick in.\u201d Applicant never received a \ncompany FMLA policy, has never seen one, does not know if it exists, and still does not \nknow. During his December 22, 2015 telephone conversation with his supervisor and \nhuman resources manager, Applicant explained that he was on leave taking care of \nmatters relating to his mother\u2019s death, debts, closing out items, and responding to emails. \nNone of his leave was submitted to bookkeeping as FMLA because the company did not \nhave an FMLA code; it was all submitted as annual (PTO) leave. Applicant was not \nintentionally \u201ctrying to mislead anybody.\u201d (T. 36-37, 45-46, 59, 72-73, 77.)  \n \nApplicant testified that during the December 22, 2015 telephone call, he \u201c[didn\u2019t] \nunderstand\u201d why the company\u2019s first response was to terminate him, with no warnings or \nany reprimands at all. Applicant had worked for the company for four and a half years and \nhad never received any \u201cderogatory counseling or performance evaluations.\u201d  Now he \nwas told that he could resign and take his severance or be fired. Applicant consulted an \nemployment attorney, who told him that since the applicable state law made employment \nat-will, Applicant\u2019s chances of success were not very good. So, Applicant elected the \nseparation agreement with severance pay. (Tr. 38-39; AE D, p. 6; GE 1. (See also \nAnswer, p. 3 (Applicant \u201cnever received an negative counseling or reprimand of any kind \nprior to that incident.\u201d).) \n \nIn his Answer, Applicant explained what he believed was his company\u2019s motive to \nseparate him:  \n \n[T]he company CEO (at the time) and myself had bumped heads several \ntimes over proper security protocols the company had violated, which I was \n\n6 \n \nobligated to report. I faced many challenges working with the CEO when he \nwas my direct supervisor, but they did not affect my ability to perform my \nduties as required. Although the company informed me that I was being \nasked to leave due to the incorrect use of FMLA, I believe this situation \nprovided the opportunity for the CEO to get me out of the company. Had I \nnot been instructed to put the FMLA comment under the annual leave code \nthe situation would not have existed. (Answer, p. 3.) \n \nApplicant also explained why he did not tell anyone at work that his mother had \npassed away. He said that when he returned to work on October 23, 2015, nobody asked \nabout his mother. Applicant did not think about notifying anyone. The only other person \nwho knew she passed was the hospice caregiver who was there at the time. That person \nwould inform other persons who needed to know. Applicant did not think it was pertinent \nto FMLA, because he was taking PTO leave anyway, without regard to FMLA, relying on \nthe times that his employer told him to \u201ctake as much as you need.\u201d In addition, his \nmother\u2019s death was the third family death in a year and a half. Applicant \u201cjust [found] it \nhard to discuss. People to this day don\u2019t know my mom passed.\u201d (Tr. 35, 44-47.) \n \nThere is nothing in the record showing that FMLA imposes notification obligations \non an employee on FMLA leave if the qualifying serious health conditions result in the \ndeath of the afflicted family member. There may be such obligations under FMLA, but \nnone are in the record here. (GE 2, pp. 7, 12-17.)  \n \nApplicant testified about the Guideline F allegations. He explained that SOR \u00b6 1.a \n(a collection account) is for a car lease that was repossessed and left a deficiency balance \nof $5,400. SOR \u00b6 1.b (a charge-off) was for a second vehicle he bought in 2015. This \nsecond vehicle was used for Applicant\u2019s commute. His first vehicle was used to take his \nmother to and from cancer treatments. He no longer has this second vehicle. When \nApplicant was separated from his employment as discussed above in December 2015, \nhe was able to make the payments on these two accounts until December 2016. Instead \nof falling behind at that time, Applicant enrolled those debts in a debt counseling and \nconsolidation program. Since May 2017, Applicant has made payments of $1,200 per \nmonth in that program and has never missed a payment.  SOR \u00b6 1.a and SOR \u00b6 1.b have \nbeen resolved and documented as such in that program. (Tr. 21-26; AE A; AE B, p. 3; AE \nC.) He also attended a financial counseling program at a nearby military installation. (Tr. \n32-33.) \n \nThere are two other accounts enrolled in that program being paid off, one to WFF \nfor funeral expenses and one to WFFNA, a home improvement loan. They are not alleged \nin the SOR. Applicant is current on his child support payments ($1,300 per month) and \nhis home mortgage. He is current on his state and federal taxes and has no delinquent \ndebts other that those about which he testified. Applicant has been employed in his \ncurrent job since December 2016. He makes about $68,000 per year. Applicant\u2019s monthly \ntake-home pay is about $3,400. His military pension is $1,600 per month, and he has no \nother sources of income. Applicant\u2019s checking account balance is about $1,400 and his \nsavings account is about $4,000. His 401(k) account has a balance of about $3,000 to \n\n7 \n \n$4,000. Applicant\u2019s monthly net remainder is about $400 per month, which covers school \nand transportation expenses. He has not taken any vacations and keeps an automated \nbudget. (Tr. 30-33.)   \n \nLaw and Policies \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). Individuals are eligible for access to classified information \n\u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest\u201d to authorize \nsuch access. E.O. 10865 \u00a7 2; SEAD-4, \u00b6 E.4. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance, an administrative \njudge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions. The \nguidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human \nbehavior, an administrative judge applies the guidelines in a  commonsense manner, \nconsidering all available and reliable information, in arriving at a fair and impartial \ndecision. SEAD-4, Appendix A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(c), 2(d). \n \nDepartment Counsel must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged \nin the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. Applicants are responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and \nother evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or \nproven . . . and has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable \nclearance decision.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  \n \nAdministrative Judges are responsible for ensuring that an applicant receives fair \nnotice of the issues raised, has a reasonable opportunity to litigate those issues, and is \nnot subjected to unfair surprise. ISCR Case No. 12-01266 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 4, 2014). \nIn resolving the ultimate question regarding an applicant\u2019s eligibility, \u201c[a]ny doubt \nconcerning personnel being considered for national security eligibility will be resolved in \nfavor of the national security.\u201d SEAD-4, Appendix A, \u00b6 2(b). See also SEAD-4, \u00b6 E.4. \nMoreover, the Supreme Court has held that officials making \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours. The Government reposes a high degree of trust and \nconfidence in individuals to whom it grants access to classified information. Decisions \ninclude, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or \ninadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain \ndegree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of \ncompromise of classified information. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n8 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDiscussion \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nAG \u00b6 15 sets forth the general concern based on personal conduct that is relevant \nin this case:  \n \n \n Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, \ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure \nto cooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16(b) provides the specific disqualifying condition that is potentially \napplicable in this case:  \n \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer\u2026. \n \n \nIn this case, the SOR alleged that Applicant gave his employer false information \nto obtain and continue FMLA leave. A statement is false or dishonest when it is made \ndeliberately (knowingly and willfully). An omission of relevant and material information is \nnot deliberate if, for example, the person genuinely forgot about it, inadvertently \noverlooked it, misunderstood the question, reasonably did not know the information, or \ngenuinely thought the information did not need to be reported. In assessing an allegation \nof deliberate falsification, I consider not only the allegation and Applicant\u2019s answer but all \nrelevant circumstances, with particular scrutiny of Applicant\u2019s state of mind or intent. (AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and (d)(1)-(9) (explaining the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept and factors).) \n \n \nThe material facts are undisputed. From May 2011 until December 2015, Applicant \nwas employed as an FSO at a company that is the subject of the Guideline E allegation. \nSince 2013 Applicant was the sole caretaker of his mother, who lived with him. She was \nsuffering from cancer. In late 2014 or early 2015, one of her doctors told Applicant that \ncombating her cancer could require Applicant to take extended time off and \nrecommended that he look into his employer\u2019s FMLA policy. In January 2015, Applicant \nasked his employer for its FMLA policy. He was told that the FMLA policy was being \ndeveloped.  \n \n \nIn August 2015, Applicant\u2019s mother\u2019s doctor advised that she would probably not \nsurvive through the year. Therefore, Applicant asked his employer for its FMLA policy and \nwas told again that it was still being developed. As a result, Applicant did research on \nFMLA and learned only that FMLA procedures were not uniform and depended on each \ncompany\u2019s policy. Applicant did, however, find a FMLA form that had to be verified by the \n\n9 \n \ntreating doctor and submitted to the employer. In September 2015, he submitted a \nrequest to his employer asking for PTO, bereavement leave, and FMLA leave for the \nOctober to December 2015 timeframe. Applicant was told that he would need to use up \nhis PTO before FMLA would take effect. Applicant agreed, because he had ample PTO \nbanked. He was told again that the FMLA policy was still being developed. \n \n \nBy later in the fall of 2015, Applicant\u2019s mother was failing, so he needed to make \nleave arrangements to care for her. On October 14, 2015, he submitted an Out of Office \nRequest. On October 15, 2015, that request was approved by Applicant\u2019s direct \nsupervisor and human resources manager, approving three types of leave from \nNovember 2, 2015 until January 4, 2016 -- PTO, Bereavement, and FMLA. On more than \none occasion, Applicant was told by his direct supervisor, who knew of his mother\u2019s \ncondition, to take \u201cas much time as he needed.\u201d  \n \n \nOn October 22, 2015, Applicant\u2019s mother passed away while he was in the process \nof taking her to a full-time hospice. Applicant notified his employer that day that he was in \nthe emergency room and might not return that day. Applicant returned on October 23, \n2015 but did not tell anyone at work; nobody asked, and he had suffered three family \ndeaths in just over three years and found it hard to discuss his mother\u2019s passing. He \nreturned to work on the 23d to get the company ready for a security inspection in January \n2016.  \n \n \nBefore starting his leave on November 2, 2015, his human resources manager \nasked him on October 26, 2015, to submit a FMLA form, so he did so by submitting the \nFMLA form he had submitted earlier. That form was ultimately approved by Applicant\u2019s \nemployer on October 29, 2015, authorizing leave from November 2, 2015, until January \n4, 2016 for 96.33 hours of PTO being used first and any remainder being LWOP. \nApplicant, however, never received that approval until he received Department \nCounsel\u2019s discovery letter on February 28, 2018.  \n \n \nAlthough that approval was emailed by Applicant\u2019s human resources manager to \nApplicant on November 3, 2015, it was sent to Applicant\u2019s work email. Strangely, his work \nemail had been disconnected by his company\u2019s IT upon direction of some supervisor. \nThis was unusual and not the norm. Even if Applicant had received the November 3, 2015 \nemail, its approval was wholly consistent with the approved Out of Office Request, i.e., \nthe leave was approved for the period requested, and PTO must be used first.  \n \n \nIn light of the foregoing chronology, the record shows that on numerous occasions, \nApplicant sought guidance from his employer on its FMLA policy, only to be told each \ntime that it was under development. As his mother was failing, Applicant began making \nleave plans for her death. All he knew when his mother died on October 22, 2016, was \nthat his Out of Office Request of October 14, 2016, was approved for PTO, Bereavement \nLeave, and FMLA from November 2, 2016, to January 4, 2016. Applicant also knew that \nhe had to exhaust PTO before FMLA would kick in, which was not a problem because he \nhad 205 hours of PTO banked. Applicant\u2019s Out of Office Request was not based on any \nfalse or misleading information. Applicant did not receive any FMLA leave, and the Out \n\n10 \n \nof Office Request did not \u201cgrant or continue\u201d any FMLA leave. I find that Applicant did not \nintentionally provide the company with false or misleading information to obtain or \ncontinue FMLA leave. In Applicant\u2019s mind, he was using PTO. Since I find that Applicant \nwas not using any FMLA leave, I need not reach the question whether he had some \nobligation under FMLA to report his mother\u2019s death. Applicant honestly and reasonably \nbelieved that he did not need to disclose his mother\u2019s death to his employer in order to \nuse some of his banked PTO.  \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant has two delinquent debt raising a concern under \nGuideline F. The financial considerations security concern is explained at AG \u00b6 18, which \nin pertinent part, states: \n  \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence.  \n \n Guideline F is not limited to a consideration of whether a person with financial \nissues might be tempted to compromise classified information or engage in other illegality \nto pay their debts. It also addresses the extent to which the circumstances giving rise to \ndelinquent debt and other security-significant financial issues cast doubt upon a person\u2019s \nself-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified information. \n(ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May. 1, 2012).)  \n \n \nIn assessing Applicant\u2019s case, I considered the following pertinent disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions: \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; \n \n AG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n\n11 \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \nA security clearance adjudication is not a debt-collection process. Rather, an \nadministrative judge examines the way an applicant handles his or her personal financial \nobligations to assess how they may handle their security obligations. (See generally ISCR \nCase No. ISCR Case No. 12-09719 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Apr. 6, 2016).) Here, Applicant\u2019s \nsecurity clearance eligibility was called into question by his two delinquent debts alleged \nin the SOR. I conclude that disqualifying condition AG \u00b6 19(a) applies. The next inquiry is \nwhether any mitigating conditions apply.  \n \n \nI find that Applicant\u2019s termination of employment occurred under unusual \ncircumstances that are unlikely to recur. His loss of employment and the financial \nproblems it caused Applicant were largely beyond his control, and he acted responsibly \nby seeking counseling and debt consolidation. Applicant made good faith efforts to repay \nhis creditors. Applicant\u2019s finances are currently in good order. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), (b), (c), and \n(d) apply.  \n \n \nThe record does not raise doubts about Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, \ngood judgment, and ability to protect classified information. In reaching this conclusion, I \nweighed the evidence as a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed \nthe unfavorable evidence or vice versa. I also gave due consideration to the whole-person \nconcept. (AG \u00b6 2(a)(1)-(9).)  Accordingly, I conclude that Applicant met his ultimate \nburden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nhis eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E (Personal Conduct):      \n   For Applicant \n \n \n     Subparagraph 1.a: \n \n \n \n              For Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline F (Financial Considerations):      For Applicant \n \n \n     Subparagraphs 2.a-b:  \n \n \n               For Applicant \n \n \n \n \n\n12 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of the record as a whole, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to \ngrant Applicant access to classified information.   \n \n \n \n____________________ \nPhilip J.

Driskill, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________ \nRemand Decision \n______________ \nDAM, Shari, Administrative Judge: \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his continuing family \nand financial connections to Thailand. Based upon a review of the record as a whole, \nincluding the October 26, 2018 Appeal Board\u2019s Remand Order, national security eligibility \nfor access to classified information is denied.  \nHistory of Case \nOn April 8, 2015, Applicant submitted an electronic questionnaire for investigations \nprocessing (e-QIP). On September 29, 2017, the Department of Defense Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (DOD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \ndetailing security concerns under Guideline B (Foreign Influence). The action was taken \nunder Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to \n03/14/2019\n\n \n \n \n \n2\nClassified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective within the \nDOD on June 8, 2017. \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on October 19, 2017, and requested that his case be \ndecided by an administrative judge on the written record without a hearing. On January \n18, 2018, Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written case. A complete \ncopy of the File of Relevant Material (FORM), containing five Items, was mailed to \nApplicant and received by him February 23, 2018. The FORM notified Applicant that he \nhad an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or \nmitigation within 30 days of receipt of the FORM. Applicant did not submit any additional \ninformation or objections to any of the Government\u2019s exhibits. Items 1 through 5 are \nadmitted into evidence. I take administrative notice of the facts concerning Thailand that \nare set forth in the Government\u2019s Request for Administrative Notice, which is marked as \nItem 5 and included in the record.  \n \n \nOn August 21, 2018, I issued a Decision denying Applicant\u2019s request for national \nsecurity eligibility for access to classified information, on the basis that he failed to mitigate \nthe foreign influence allegations related to his ongoing connections to Thailand. Applicant \nappealed that Decision, but he neither challenged my findings of fact nor raised any other \nallegation of error in his appeal brief. However, his comment that he had resigned in \nJanuary 2018 from his position with the employer that sponsored his security clearance \napplication raised a jurisdictional issue.  \n \n \nOn October 26, 2018, the Appeal Board remanded the case to me to reopen the \nrecord for submission of information pertinent to jurisdiction, specifically whether \nApplicant \u201cpossessed a need for access to classified information\u201d at the time the Decision \nwas issued. I marked this Remand Order as Appeal Board (AB) Order. \n \n  \nOn February 22, 2019, I entered an order reopening the record and requesting \nsubmission of relevant information from both parties on the jurisdictional issue. On \nFebruary 27, 2019, Applicant responded by email. I marked Applicant\u2019s submission as \nApplicant Remand Exhibit (AR Ex.). On March 4, 2019, Department Counsel submitted a \nResponse to Request for Information, along with two documents. I marked the \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s submission as Department Remand Exhibits (DR Ex.) 1 through \n3. All exhibits are admitted without objection. \n \nJurisdictional Ruling \n \n \nIn his appeal brief, Applicant stated that in January 2018, he had resigned his \nposition with his employer. In response to my February 22, 2019 Order, he stated that he \nsubmitted a resignation letter in January 2018, based on his wife\u2019s health problems and \nhis need to return to Thailand to care for her. At the time, he was working for his employer \nin Iraq. (AB Order; AR Ex. A) \n \n \n In addition to citing pertinent cases in her Response to Request for Information, \nDepartment Counsel submitted a letter from Applicant\u2019s employer addressing Applicant\u2019s \n\n \n \n \n \n3\nemployment status in January and August 2018. The employer stated that Applicant left \nactive employment in January 2018, due to family issues. The employer maintained \nsponsorship of Applicant\u2019s security clearance in the Joint Personnel Adjudication System \n(JPAS) because Applicant intended to resume employment when his family problems \nwere resolved. On August 28, 2018, Applicant\u2019s employer received notice that his national \nsecurity eligibility was denied, and removed sponsorship of his security clearance. JPAS \nrecorded that Applicant was separated by the employer on August 29, 2018. (DR Exs.2, \n3)   \n \n \nBased on the information submitted from both parties, subsequent to the Appeal \nBoard\u2019s Remand Order, I find that Applicant \u201cstill possessed a need for access to \nclassified information\u201d on August 21, 2018, the date I issued the initial Decision in this \ncase, and therefore DOHA had legal jurisdiction over the matter. My initial Decision, \ndenying Applicant\u2019s national security eligibility for a security clearance is confirmed and \nfully incorporated below.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \n \nApplicant admitted the allegations in the SOR. Those admissions are incorporated \ninto the following findings of fact:  \n \n \nApplicant is 56 years old. He was born in the United States. He served on active \nduty in the U.S. Marines from 1981 to 2001, when he retired with an honorable discharge. \nHe has been married four times and has an adult child from one of those marriages. After \nleaving military service, he worked for a period of time for a defense contractor and \nmaintained a security clearance. (Item 2)  \n \n \nApplicant has resided in Thailand since 2004. He opened a bank account in 2005 \nthat has about $30,000 in it. He married his fourth wife there in 2007. She is a citizen and \nresident of Thailand. He has two teenage stepchildren, who are citizens and residents of \nThailand. In 2009, he purchased a home in Thailand that has a current value of about \n$50,000. The home is recorded in his wife\u2019s name because he is unable to legally own a \nresidence there. From 2010 to 2015, Applicant and his wife owned and operated a \nbusiness in Thailand. (Item 2) \n \n \n In 2015, Applicant began working in the Middle East for a defense contractor \nsupporting U.S. military troops. He maintains his residency in Thailand with his wife and \nstepchildren. He returns to Thailand on leave and lives there when not working out of the \ncountry. (Items 1, 2) \n    \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law, sister-in-law, and two brothers-in-law are citizens and \nresidents of Thailand. Applicant said none of those family members work for the Thai \ngovernment. He needs to maintain a bank account there for living expenses and \npurposes. (Items 1, 2) \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n4\n         I have taken administrative notice of facts contained in U.S. Government \npublications concerning Thailand as outlined in Item 5, including the following: Thailand \nis a constitutional monarchy, but since a military coup in 2014, it is being ruled by an \ninterim military government. As a consequence of that coup, the United States has \nreduced its security assistance and military engagements with Thailand, although it \ncontinues to maintain economic and diplomatic ties. Thailand\u2019s increasing economic, \nmilitary, and diplomatic ties to China are a concern to the United States. The U.S. State \nDepartment assessed Thailand as having a moderate risk of terrorism based on recent \nincidents in the country\u2019s southern region. Thailand\u2019s human rights abuses include \narbitrary arrests and detention; violence and discrimination against women; sex tourism; \nand limitations of worker rights and civil liberties.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s national security eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(b) and 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nAccording to Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to \nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant \nis responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who applies for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants eligibility \n\n \n \n \n \n5\nfor access to classified information or assignment in sensitive duties. Decisions include, \nby necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or \ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a \ncertain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk \nof compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides, \u201cAny determination under this order adverse to \nan applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, \nSection 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive \ninformation).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B: Foreign Influence \n \nAG \u00b6 6 expresses the security concerns regarding foreign influence:  \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism.  \n \nAG \u00b6 7 sets out conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case. Four are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;1 and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \n                                            \n1The mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, as a matter of law, \ndisqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in a foreign country and an applicant \nhas contacts with that relative, this factor alone is sufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and \ncould potentially result in the compromise of classified information. See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. \nBd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001). \n \n\n \n \n \n \n6\nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology; \n \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship \nstatus, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(f) substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign country, \nor in any foreign owned or foreign-operated business that could subject the \nindividual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation or personal \nconflict of interest. \n \nAlthough the United States and Thailand are allies in several areas, Thailand has \nexperienced recent terrorist incidents, and the U.S. State Department considers it to pose \na moderate risk. Additionally, its human rights\u2019 record causes concern. These facts place \na burden of persuasion on Applicant to demonstrate that his residency, significant \nfinancial interests, and ongoing close relationships with immediate family members and \nin-laws, who are resident citizens of Thailand, do not create a heightened risk of foreign \ninfluence or pose a security risk. The evidence is sufficient to raise security concerns \nunder AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(b), 7(e), and 7(f) shifting the burden to Applicant to prove mitigation.  \n \nAG \u00b6 8 lists conditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns. \nThose with potential application in mitigating the security concerns in this case are: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationship with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States;  \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest;  \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; and \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not be \nused effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n7\nApplicant did not clearly demonstrate that it is unlikely that he could be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual or government \nand those of the United States, as a consequence of his ongoing residency in Thailand \nand long-term relationships with immediate family members who reside there. There is \ninsufficient evidence demonstrating that Applicant has deep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the United States, such that if any conflict of interest arose, \nApplicant could be expected to resolve it in favor of U.S. interests. The record indicates \nthat Applicant has approximately $80,000 of assets in Thailand. There is no evidence that \nhe has financial interests in the United States. Accordingly, Applicant failed to establish \npersuasive mitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a), (b), (c), or (f). \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s national security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct \nand all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline B in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant is a mature individual who honorably retired from the Navy after serving \n20 years. He held a security clearance during that time and subsequently while working \nfor a defense contractor for a couple years. He has been working for another defense \ncontractor since 2015. In 2004, he moved to Thailand. Since 2007, he has been living in \nThailand with his wife and two stepchildren. He has both property and financial interests \nthere. His in-laws are citizens and residents of Thailand. He and his wife owned a \nbusiness there for five years. Other than his 20 years of U.S. military service, the record \ncontains minimal evidence of Applicant\u2019s current ties to the United States. The absence \nof mitigating evidence for the Guideline B allegations compels a finding that he failed to \nmeet his burden to mitigate the security concerns arising under the guideline for foreign \n\n \n \n \n \n8\ninfluence. The record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \n   AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.e:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 59-year-old software engineer who seeks a security clearance for a defense contractor. The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by Applicant are adopted as relevant and material findings. Additional findings follow. Background Applicant has never married and has no children. (GEs 1-2) He earned a high school diploma in June 1977 and a music teaching certification in June 1985.

Eligibility for\naccess to classified information is denied.\nStatement of the Case\nOn November 6, 2017, the Department of Defense (DoD) Consolidated\nAdjudications facility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing reasons\nunder the drug involvement, criminal conduct, and personal conduct guidelines why DoD\nadjudicators could not make the affirmative determination of eligibility for a security\nclearance, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a\nsecurity clearance shouild be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. The action was\ntaken under executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information\nWithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended. DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992, as amended\n(Directive); by Directive 4 of the Security Executive Agent, National Security Adjudicative\nGuidelines (SEAD 4).\n12/17/2018\n\nApplicant responded to the SOR on December 27, 2017, and requested a\nhearing. The case was assigned to another judge on March 20, 2018, reassigned to me\non May 30, 2018, and scheduled for hearing on June 5, 2018. A hearing was held on the\nscheduled date for the purpose of considering whether it would be clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant, continue, deny, or revoke Applicant\u2019s security clearance. At\nthe hearing, the Government\u2019s case consisted of three exhibits (GEs 1-3). Applicant\nrelied on one witness (himself) and 11 exhibits (AEs A-K). The Government\u2019s exhibits\nand Applicant\u2019s exhibits were admitted without objection. The transcript was received on\nJune 13, 2018.\nProcedural Issues\nBefore the close of the hearing, Applicant requested the record be kept open to\npermit him the opportunity to supplement the record with documentation of expunged\ncharges regarding two state drug charges and proof of probation compliance in\nconnection with a September 2016 marijuana possession conviction satisfaction. Within\nthe time permitted, Applicant supplemented the record with a cover sheet and order of\ndismissal of unidentified charges in another state and proof of probation compliance in\nconnection with his 2016 drug-related conviction.  Applicant\u2019s submissions were admitted\nwithout objection as AEs L-N.\nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline H, Applicant allegedly used marijuana with varying frequency \nfrom approximately 1974 until September 2016; (b) sold and purchased marijuana from\napproximately 1981 until 1985; (c) used marijuana at least three times in 2016 while\nholding a security clearance; (d) and was diagnosed with a condition described as\nmarijuana use in February 2017 by a licensed clinical psychologist.\nUnder Guideline J, Applicant allegedly was charged with the following: (a)\npossession of marijuana and possession of drug paraphernalia in September 2016; (b)\nengaging in construction trade without a license and proof of insurance in July 1999; (c)\nfelony forgery and engaging in construction trade without a license in February 1998; (d)\npossession of marijuana and drug paraphernalia in November 1997; (e) violation of a\nprotective order in March 1996; (f) fighting in a public place in August 1987; (g) felony\npossession and distribution of marijuana in October 1985 for which he served nine\nmonths in jail; (h) burglary, possession of marijuana, and receiving stolen property in\nMarch 1980; (i) threatening a witness, battery on a person, and misdemeanor vandalism\nin May 1979; (j) burglary in March 1979; and (k) information set forth in \u00b6 1.a-1.c of\nGuideline H.    \nUnder Guideline E, (a) each of the allegations covered in Guidelines H and J are\nincorporated and (b) the allegations covered by \u00b6\u00b6 3.b-3.c covering allegations of receipt\nof unsatisfactory evaluation in 2016 for violating company policy for using marijuana and\nplacement on his company\u2019s performance action plan due to his arrest for marijuana\npossession.  \n2\n\nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the allegations covering his\ndrug activities, arrests and charges with explanations. He claimed his drug-related\nactivities happened so long ago and under such conditions that they will not likely recur.\nAddressing his non-drug-related charges, he denied the allegations with explanations.\nHe claimed they were either dropped, duplicated, did not involve charges or felonies, or\nhappened many years ago and under such conditions that recurrences are unlikely.\nResponding to the allegations covered by Guideline E, Applicant denied receiving an\nunsatisfactory evaluation from his employer in September 2016 for violating company\npolicy for using marijuana. He admitted being placed on a performance action plan by his\nemployer.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 59-year-old software engineer who seeks a security clearance for a \ndefense contractor. The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by Applicant are\nadopted as relevant and material findings. Additional findings follow.\nBackground\nApplicant has never married and has no children. (GEs 1-2) He earned a high\nschool diploma in June 1977 and a music teaching certification in June 1985. In August\n2000, Applicant earned a programming certification from a local state community college\nin his state of residence. Between May 2005 an May 2006, he attended a state university\nin his state of residence and earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in computer science. (GE 1)\nApplicant reported no military service.\nSince November 2012, Applicant has been employed by his current employer. \n(GEs 1-2) He worked for another defense contractor between October 2009 and\nNovember 2012. (GE 1) Between December 2000 and November 2012, he worked for\nnumerous non-defense contractors in various jobs. He reported intermittent periods of\nunemployment between September 2006 and October 2009. (GEs 1-2) Records\ndocument that he has held a security clearance since 2010. (GE 1)\nApplicant's drug history\nApplicant was introduced to marijuana at the age of 14. (GE 2). Typically, he\nwould smoke marijuana a few times a month when he or his friends could get the\nsubstance. (GE 2) Between 1974 and 1985, he continued using marijuana with varying\nfrequency of use until he reached the age of 21. (GE 2) Beginning in 1981, he began to\nbuy and sell marijuana for his personal use as well as smoke the substance weekly on a\nregular basis to relieve anxiety. (GE 2) He continued this practice until 1985 when he\nwas arrested for selling marijuana. (GE 2) \nIn November 1997, Applicant was arrested and charged with possession of\nmarijuana and possession of drug paraphernalia. (GEs 2-3) In court, he pled guilty to\npossession of drug paraphernalia, and the marijuana possession charge was dropped.\n(GE 2 and AE N)\n3\n\nIn March 1980, Applicant was arrested on felony charges for burglary, possession\nof marijuana, and receiving stolen property, Applicant entered a guilty plea. Applicant\nlater filed a motion with the court to vacate his guilty plea. (AE K) This motion was\ngranted, and Applicant\u2019s felony guilty plea was dismissed and expunged. (AE K; Tr. 59) \nIn October 1985, Applicant was arrested for felony possession and distribution of\nmarijuana. (GEs 1-3) At the time, Applicant was buying and selling marijuana at the rate\nof two to three pounds a week and selling it to other unidentified individuals in\napproximately one-half or one pound quantities. (GE 2) In that month, police raided his\nhome and found approximately one pound of marijuana. (GE 2) Applicant was then\narrested and taken to jail. In court, he pleaded guilty to the possession charges and was\nsentenced to nine months in jail. (GEs 1-3; Tr. 60-61) Applicant is credited with\ncompleting his court sentence. (GE 2) Upon Applicant\u2019s subsequent motion in 2009 to\nset aside his guilty plea, the charges were dismissed, and his felony guilty plea was\nexpunged. (AE K) \nBetween 1981 and 1985, Applicant continued to use marijuana and purchased\nand sold marijuana to support his personal needs for the substance. (GEs 1-3) Following\nhis arrest for selling marijuana in 1985, Applicant ceased using the substance until early\n2016. (GE 2; Tr. 62) \nRecords document that he was arrested and charged with possession of\nmarijuana and possession of drug paraphernalia in December 1997. (GEs 1-3) In court,\nhe pled guilty to possession of marijuana paraphernalia, and the marijuana possession\ncharge was dropped. (AE N) The record contains no probative evidence of Applicant\u2019s\nusing or possessing marijuana prior to his arrest.\nSometime in early 2016, Applicant began dating a woman who typically smoked\nmarijuana in a homemade bong made from a soda can. (GE 2) Feeling peer pressure\nfrom his girlfriend to use the marijuana she offered him, he used marijuana on\napproximately three occasions in 2016, with the last occurring in September 2016. All of\nhis marijuana use and possession in 2016 occurred while he held a security clearance.\n(GEs 1-22 and AE F; Tr. 70) While he likes the feeling he gets from marijuana use, he\nknows his use violated DoD policy, as well as Federal and state law. (GE 2 and AE F)\nIn September 2016, Applicant was arrested and charged with possession of\nmarijuana and possession of drug paraphernalia. Applicant had been home at the time\nwhen police arrived in response to a complaint by his tenant. After disclosing to police\nthat he had a small amount of marijuana in his unit, and rented the other unit, police\narrested him and charged him with marijuana possession. (GE 1-3) Applicant disclosed\nhis arrest the following day to his employer. (GEs 2-3; Tr. 65-66) \nOnce in court to answer to the 2016 marijuana possession and marijuana\nparaphernalia charges against him, Applicant pled guilty to marijuana and marijuana\nparaphernalia charges, was directed to see a substance abuse evaluator, and was\nplaced on probation. Probation conditions set by the court for his September 2016\noffense included counseling and six months of supervised probation. (GEs 1-3 and AE L;\n4\n\nTr. 69-70) Applicant, in turn, self-referred himself to a substance abuse clinic in fulfillment\nof the conditions set by both the sentencing court and his employer.\nDue to his September 2016 arrest for possession of illegal drugs and drug\nparaphernalia, In February 2017, Applicant was placed on a performance action plan\nand required to complete an improvement plan. (GE 2 and AE A) To complete his action\nplan, Applicant was required to seek counseling on substance abuse through an\nemployee assistance program and complete counseling sessions recommended by the\nprovider; maintain a lifestyle consistent and compliant for someone that holds a security\nclearance; and receive negative test results from any directed random drug tests. (GE 2)\nIn his follow-up counseling sessions (three in all) with a licensed clinical\npsychiatrist, who diagnosed him with a condition described as marijuana use under the\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual-5 (Am. Psych. Assoc. 2013) (DSM-5). (GEs 1-2)\nBefore entering a diagnosis, his mental health evaluator administered an SASSI-3 test\nand cleared him of any substance abuse or dependence problems. (AE F; Tr. 63-64)  \nApplicant submitted to two randomly administered urinalyses directed by his\nemployer in 2016 and 2017, respectively. (AEs D-E) Both tests produced negative\nresults. (AEs D-E) Applicant was credited with satisfying his probation conditions in May\n2017, and he has not used marijuana since September 2016. (AEs C and L; Tr. 64) And\nto reinforce his assurances that he has disassociated from persons who use illegal drugs\n(including his former tenant), Applicant sued his tenant to vacate the premises leased\nfrom the former. (AE B; Tr. 55-58)  Disposition of the lawsuit remains pending.\nNon-drug-related arrest history\nOther criminal charges waged against Applicant include engaging in construction\ntrade without a license or proof of insurance in July 1999 and felony forgery and\nengaging in construction trade without a license in February 1998. While the 1999\ncharges were dismissed in July 1999, Applicant pled guilty to the 1998 charges and was\nconvicted of a misdemeanor offense.  (AE N) \nBesides the forgery and construction trade charges, Applicant was charged with\nother non-marijuana offenses between 1979 and 1996. In March 1996, he was charged\nwith violating a protective order. Applicant denies the charges, and the case summary\ndoes not indicate any disposition. (AEs J, N) Records confirm that Applicant was\ncharged in March 1979 with burglary and in May 1979 with threatening a witness, battery\non person, and misdemeanor vandalism. Dispositions of these charges are not available.\n \nWork-related adverse performance evaluations\nAs the result of his September 2016 drug-related arrest, Applicant received an\nunsatisfactory evaluation for violating company policy for using marijuana. (GEs 1-2) He\nwas placed on an action plan by his employer due to his arrest for possession of\nmarijuana. His performance review of November 2016 included no evaluations on a\n5\n\nnumber of performance elements and an overall unsatisfactory rating. (AEs A and I) Still,\nApplicant has kept his employment with his employer. (Tr. 67-68).\nEndorsements\nApplicant is well-regarded by his supervisors and co-workers. His supervisor \ncharacterized him as a strong worker who can be trusted to perform his work thoroughly\nand efficiently. (AE H) He credited him with strong professional commitments in all areas\nhe is responsible for as a member of his intelligence team. (AE H) A former general\nmanager familiar with Applicant\u2019s work described Applicant as a thoughtful, trustworthy\nemployee on the company\u2019s development team who is always considerate of his\ncolleagues and never gave reason to doubt his job performance. (GE I) A project lead of\nApplicant\u2019s software team credited Applicant with helping to modernize a military project\nto keep pace with the newest technologies and protocols. (AE G) And a good friend who\nworked with Applicant for four years, and is aware of his 2016 drug-related charges,\ncredited Applicant with good software work skills, dependability, and a strong work ethic.\n(Tr. 82-83) In his opinion, Applicant gained valuable lessons from his 2016 drug-related\nincident. (Tr. 85)\n                                                       Policies\nThe AGs list guidelines to be used by administrative judges in the decision making\nprocess covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that could\ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as considerations\nthat could affect the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified\ninformation. These guidelines include conditions that could raise as security concern and\nmay be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and many of the conditions that\ncould mitigate security concerns. \nThese guidelines must be considered before deciding whether or not a security\nclearance should be granted, continued, or denied. The guidelines do not require\nadministrative judges to place exclusive reliance on the enumerated disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a decision. Each of the guidelines is\nto be evaluated in the context of the whole-person in accordance with AG, \u00b6 2(c)\nIn addition to the relevant AGs, administrative judges must take into account the\npertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in AG \u00b6 2(a)\nof the AGs, which are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial into\naccount the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and impartial\ncommonsense decision based upon a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines\nwithin the  context of the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine\na sufficient period of an applicant's life to enable predictive judgments to be made about\nwhether the applicant is an acceptable security risk. When evaluating an applicant's\nconduct, the relevant guidelines are to be considered together with the following AG \u00b6\n2(a) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the\nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of\n6\n\nthe conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or\nabsence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral chances; (7) the motivation for\nthe conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the evidentiary burden shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation, or\nmitigation. Based on the requirement of Exec. Or. 10865 that all security clearances be\nclearly consistent with the national interest, the applicant has the ultimate burden of\ndemonstrating his or her clearance eligibility. [s]ecurity-clearance determinations should\nerr, if they must, on the side of denials.\" See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 531 (1988). And because all security clearances must be clearly consistent with the\nnational interest, the burden of persuasion must remain with the Applicant.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication\npolicy concerns are pertinent herein:                                    \n                                                    Drug Involvement\nThe Concern: The illegal use of controlled substances, to\ninclude the misuse of prescription and non-prescription drugs,\nand the use of other substances that causes physical or\nmental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with\ntheir intended purpose can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such\nbehavior may lead to physical or psychological impairment\nand because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or\nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations . . . AG\n\u00b6 24.\n                                        Criminal Conduct\nThe Concern: Criminal activity creates doubts about a\nperson\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very\nnature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness to\ncomply with laws, rules, and regulations. AG \u00b6 30\n     Personal Conduct\nThe Concern: Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack\nof candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules\nand regulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or\nsensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to\ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during\n7\n\nnational security investigative or adjudicative processes. . . .\nAG \u00b6 15  \n                                            Burden of Proof\nBy virtue of the principles and policies framed by the AGs, a decision to grant or \ncontinue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon a threshold finding\nthat to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest. Because the Directive\nrequires administrative judges to make a commonsense appraisal of the evidence\naccumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for\nasecurity clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and materiality of that\nevidence. See United States v. Gaudin, 515 U.S. 506, 509-511 (1995). As with all\nadversarial proceedings, the judge may draw only those inferences which have are\nreasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record. \nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) it must prove by substantial\nevidence any controverted facts alleged in the SOR, and (2) it must demonstrate that the\nfacts proven have a material bearing to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a\nsecurity clearance. The required materiality showing, however, does not require the\nGovernment to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled or\nabused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security clearance. Rather,\nthe judge must consider and weigh the cognizable risks that an applicant may\ndeliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the evidentiary burden shifts to the applicant for the purpose of \nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation, or\nmitigation Based on the requirement of Exec. Or. 10865 that all security clearances be\nclearly consistent with the national interest, the applicant has the ultimate burden of\ndemonstrating his or her clearance eligibility. \"[S]ecurity-clearance determinations should\nerr, if they must, on the side of denials.\" See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 531 (1988). And, because all security clearances must be clearly consistent with the\nnational interest, the burden of persuasion must remain with th Applicant.\n                                                         Analysis\nApplicant is a well-regarded software engineer who presents with a considerable\nhistory of drug involvement that includes drug-related arrests and an unsatisfactory \npersonnel evaluation of Applicant as the result of his violating company policy in 2016 for\nusing marijuana. Principal security issues in this case center on Applicant's lengthy\nhistory of drug involvement that includes a still very recent 2016 marijuana arrest and\nconviction.\nDrug concerns\nOver a considerable period of drug activity stretching from 1974 to 1985, and\nmore recently in 2016, Applicant used, possessed, sold, and purchased marijuana. His\nmost recent involvement with marijuana (both use and possession) occurred while\n8\n\nholding a security clearance. Applicant\u2019s admissions to using and possessing illegal\ndrugs while holding a security clearance raises concerns about risks of recurrence as\nwell as judgment issues. On the strength of the evidence presented, three disqualifying\nconditions of the  AGs for drug abuse are applicable: DC \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), \"any substance\nmisuse,\" 25(c), \"illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation,\nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug\nparaphernalia; and 25(f), \u201cany illegal drug use while granted access to classified\ninformation or holding a sensitive position.\u201d \nIn Applicant's case, his significant involvement with marijuana over a number of\nyears, capped by his recurrent use and possession of marijuana in 2016 while holding a\nsecurity clearance following over 20 years of self-imposed abstinence, raises serious\nquestions over the strength of his most recent abstinence commitments. To his credit, he\nsought substance abuse counseling in compliance with the directions he received from\nthe sentencing court and his employer and has since satisfied the court\u2019s probation\nconditions. For these initiatives, he warrants some application of MC \u00b6 26(d),\n\u201csatisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, including, but not\nlimited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, without recurrence or abuse, and a\nfavorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical professional,\u201d and received a favorable\nprognosis from his substance abuse evaluator. \nBut while Applicant's material use and possession of illegal drugs in 2016 has\nnever been repeated since his acknowledged last use in September 2016 in any proven\nway, his recurrent use and possession of marijuana products after a lengthy period of\nsustained abstinence is still too recent to enable safe predictions of continued avoidance\nof illegal drugs. It is too soon to fully apply any of the potentially mitigating conditions to\nApplicant's situation. While Applicant's assurances that his drug involvement is a thing of\nthe past are encouraging, more time is needed to draw safe inferences that he is not a\nrecurrence risk.\nConsidering the record as a whole, there is insufficient probative evidence of\nsustainable mitigation to make predictable judgments about his ability to avoid drugs and\ndrug purchases in the foreseeable future. Taking into account all of the facts and\ncircumstances surrounding Applicant's past marijuana use in 2016 while holding a\nsecurity clearance, he does not mitigate security concerns with respect to the allegations\ncovered by subparagraphs \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c of the SOR. Based on the favorable prognosis he\nreceived from his substance abuse evaluator, subparagraph 1.d is resolved favorable to\nApplicant.\nCriminal conduct concerns\nAdditional security concerns are raised over Applicant\u2019s considerable history of\narrests, both drug-related and non-drug related. Most of his pre-2016 drug-related\narrests (i.e., those of 1997, 1980, and 1985) are aged, but still relevant and material to a\npattern assessment of Applicant\u2019s recurrent involvement with illegal drugs and drug\nparaphernalia. Applicable to Applicant\u2019s situation is DC \u00b6\u00b6 31(a), \u201ca pattern of minor\noffenses, any one of which on its own would be unlikely to affect a national security\n9\n\neligibility decision, but which in combination cast doubt on the individual\u2019s judgment,\nreliability, or trustworthiness,\u201d and 31(b), \u201cevidence (including, but not limited to, a\ncredible allegation, an  admission, and matters of official record ) of criminal conduct,\nregardless of wether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted,\u201d of\nthe criminal conduct guideline.  \nDue to the age of most of Applicant\u2019s drug-related and non-drug-related criminal\noffenses, partial mitigation is available to him.  MCs \u00b6\u00b6 32(a), \u201cso much time has elapsed\nsince the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under such unusual\ncircumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d and 31(d) \u201cthere is evidence of successful\nrehabilitation: including, but not limited to, the passage of time without recurrence of\ncriminal activity, restitution, compliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training\nor higher education, good employment record, or constructive community involvement,\u201d\napply. \nOverall, Applicant\u2019s recurrent drug-related offenses covering his 1980, 1985, 1997\nand 2016 charges and convictions form a part of a continuing pattern of illegal drug\ninvolvement that are inner-related with his drug-related activities over an extended period\ntime spanning 1980-2016. Because his older drug-related arrests cannot be reasonably\nseparated from his drug-related activities covered by Guideline H, they cannot be\nindependently mitigated. So, while Applicant\u2019s non-drug-related arrests are mitigated by\nthe passage of time and subsequent dismissal and expungement in some cases, his\ndrug-related offenses cannot be separated from the Government\u2019s continuing drug-\nrelated concerns covered by Guideline H.  \nPersonal conduct concerns\nThe Government\u2019s drug-related  concerns are also raised under the personal\nconduct guideline. Most of the allegations are adequately covered by the drug and\ncriminal conduct guidelines and need not be addressed anew under the personal\nconduct guideline. Separately covered are Applicant\u2019s unsatisfactory evaluation for 2016\nthat is keyed to his self-reported violation of his company\u2019s policy for avoiding marijuana\nuse. As the result of his drug-related arrest of September 2016, his company placed him\non a performance action plan. With the support of his supervisors and managers,\nApplicant is widely credit with being in compliance with his plan. \nBy all reported accounts from his supervisors and managers, Applicant continues\nto function and prosper with his employer and has successfully gained the confidence of\nhis company that he is not at risk to relapse to recurrent drug usage. Personal conduct\nconcerns of his employer resulting from his 2016 arrest are resolved and mitigated in\nApplicant\u2019s favor.  \nWhole-person assessment\nIn making a whole-person assessment of Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, reliability,\nand good judgment, consideration is given to not only the drug, criminal conduct, and\npersonal conduct issues raised in the SOR, but the contributions he has and continues to\n10\n\nmake to his employer and the defense industry in general. Overall, though, Applicant has\nestablished insufficient probative evidence of his overall trustworthiness and\nunderstanding of DoD policy constraints on the use of illegal substances to facilitate safe\npredictions that he is at no risk of recurrence of illegal drug usage.

Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n                                         Statement of the Case \n \nOn May 3, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued Applicant a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F, financial \nconsiderations. Applicant timely answered the SOR and elected to have his case \ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.  \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s file of relevant material \n(FORM) on July 18, 2018. Applicant received the FORM on July 24, 2018, and had 30 \ndays to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. \nApplicant did not object to the Government\u2019s evidence, and he provided a one-page \nresponse to the FORM dated August 15, 2018. He attached a two-page Security Title \nAgency, Inc. borrower\u2019s settlement agreement concerning the refinancing of his \nmortgage loan. The Government\u2019s evidence, identified as Items 1 through 7, is admitted \ninto evidence without objection. The case was assigned to me on November 19, 2018.  \n \n   12/13/2018\n\n \n2 \n \n \n  Findings of Fact1 \n \nApplicant is 54 years old. He graduated from high school in 1982. Applicant has \nbeen employed as an assembly technician by a federal contractor since 1985. He had a \nsecurity clearance since then with no issues. Applicant reports no military service and \nhe has been married since June 1993. Previously, he was married in 1983 and divorced \none year later. He reports one adult daughter, and three adult step-children.  \n \nApplicant reported delinquent debts in section 26 of his security clearance \napplication (SCA),2 including failure to file his 2008 federal income tax return, and failure \nto file and pay his 2009 federal income taxes as required.  Applicant stated he did not \nhave enough money to pay $12,000 for 2009 income taxes, and he did not remember \nthe circumstances why he forgot to file.3 He stated that he has now entered into a \nrepayment plan with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Applicant also reported credit-\ncard debt and a Nissan automobile loan that he had cosigned for his step-son who was \nunable to make payments. The loan went into default and the vehicle was subsequently \nrepossessed. He ascribes his wife\u2019s loss of employment in April 2015 as the reason for \nthese debts.4 She had produced 40% of their household earnings.  \n \nIn his enhanced subject interview (ESI) conducted by an Office of Management \nPersonnel (OPM) investigator on July 20, 2017, Applicant stated that the 2007 vehicle, \nfor which he cosigned, was repossessed in 2015.5 He received notice of a default \njudgment entered against him, in the amount of $7,584, on April 4, 2017. This was a \nresult of the repossession of his 2005 Ford. The creditor obtained a writ of garnishment \nagainst Applicant in June 2017. He claimed that this judgment at SOR \u00b6 1.a was \nsatisfied when the garnishments of $400 or $500 per month from his paycheck ended in \nJune 2016.6 He produced no documentary evidence to substantiate this claim.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife went to the emergency room at a hospital in February 2016, and \nher treatment was out of network or part of their deductible. Again, the delinquent debt \nescalated to a judgment against Applicant in the amount of $1,430 and a writ of \ngarnishment by the creditor was filed at SOR \u00b6 1.i. Applicant and his wife both had \nmedical issues. Applicant claims he does not have the money to pay his uncovered \nmedical debts at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i to 1.o because he is only earning 60% of his ordinary \n                                                          \n1 Unless stated otherwise, the source of the information in this section is Applicant\u2019s September 2, 2016 \nSecurity Clearance Application (SCA) (Item 2).  \n \n2 Item 2.  \n \n3 Item 2, p. 30. \n \n4 Item 2, p. 34. \n \n5 Item 3. \n \n6 Item 3, p. 3, and Item 7. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nincome while he is out on disability since December 2016 for back related issues.7 The \ndebt placed for collection in the amount of $2,576 at SOR \u00b6 1.p arose from a credit-card \nlinked to his store-0club membership. Applicant stated that the debt in the amount of \n$781 at SOR \u00b6 1.q was for an old cell-phone account that he thought he had paid off. \nThe debt in the amount of $600 placed for collection at SOR \u00b6 1.r was for an apartment \nthat he cosigned with his step-son. Applicant admits owing the latter debt for cleaning \nfees, but he can not afford to pay it.  \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial difficulties started in late 2016 after his wife lost her job and \nhe went out on disability for a back injury, thereby losing the opportunity for overtime \nearnings. Applicant\u2019s stepson is living with him due to his own difficulties, and Applicant \nis also raising two grandchildren, including one with a disability. (Item 3) This has \ncaused enormous financial strain and Applicant stated he is \u201crobbing Peter to pay \nPaul.\u201d8 He decided it was more important to pay his mortgage and put food on the table, \nand he let the credit card and medical debts go into arears. (Item 3) Applicant stated he \nwas planning to meet with a bankruptcy attorney in July 2017 and discuss filing a \nbankruptcy petition. However, no documentation has been provided to reflect that he \nactually filed for bankruptcy protection, except for documents produced by the \ngovernment to show an earlier Chapter 7 petition was filed by Applicant in 1994.9 \nApplicant stated that he has no discretionary income left over at the end of each month \nand he is \u201cdrowning in debt.\u201d (item 3) He hopes to retire debt-free in three or four years.  \n \nIn 2008, Applicant changed his IRS Form W-4 withholdings to 10. Thus, he was \nnot paying enough federal income taxes and he owed the IRS $12,000 in back taxes. \nHe started a repayment plan with the IRS but did not follow through. For the last several \nyears, he was supposed to get a $3,000 to $5,000 income tax refund, but the IRS \nwithheld these payments and applied them to his tax debt. (Item 3) He started a new \nrepayment plan with the IRS on July 25, 2017, and he is supposed to send the IRS $25 \na month for one year.10 He attached to his answer proof of only one payment to the IRS \nof $100 on April 2, 2018. \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted owing the $3,000 federal income \ntax deficiency, the three judgements, and all the other alleged consumer or medical \ndebts totaling $20,535. He provided no evidence of payment plans, except with the IRS, \nor financial counseling. He did not demonstrate a stream of payments of $25 made to \nthe IRS in compliance with the purported repayment plan. Instead, he provided \nevidence of one payment of $100 to the IRS made in April 2018. Applicant provided no \nperformance evaluations, character reference letters, or evidence of community \ninvolvement.  \n                                                          \n7 Item 3, p. 4. \n \n8 Item 3, p. 4. \n \n9 Item 6.  \n \n10 Item 3, p. 5. \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \n \n \n                                            Policies \n \n \nThis action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the new Administrative Guidelines (AGs) \npromulgated in Security Executive Agent Directive 4 (SEAD 4), effective within the DOD \non June 8, 2017.  \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \neligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period and a careful \nweighing of a number of variables of an individual\u2019s life to make an affirmative \ndetermination that the individual is an acceptable security risk. This is known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nThe Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in \nthe SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is responsible for presenting \nwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by \napplicant or proven, and has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a \nfavorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. Decisions \ninclude consideration of the possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or \ninadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain \ndegree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of \ncompromise of classified information. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  Analysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b618:  \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance abuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following \napply here:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;   \n \n           (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  \n \n           (f) failure to pay or fraudulently filing annual federal, state, local income tax \n               returns or failure to pay annual federal, state, or local income tax as  \n \n    required.          \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts alleged in the SOR are confirmed by his credit \nreports, answer to the SOR, and response to the FORM. The Government produced \nsubstantial evidence to support the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(b), 19(c), \nand 19(f), thereby shifting the burden to Applicant to produce evidence to rebut, explain, \n\n \n6 \n \n \nextenuate, or mitigate the facts.11 Applicant has not met that burden. Most of the \ndelinquent debts have not been addressed.  \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are \npotentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control . . . , and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances;     \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements.  \n \n \n Applicant has made little or no progress in resolving his delinquent debts. He \nhas only provided evidence of one payment to the IRS and scant explanation how he \nbecame delinquent on these debts in the first place, aside from his wife\u2019s job loss, and \nhis own back problems and lost overtime opportunities. Applicant has known about \nthese tax problems and delinquencies for over two years since he self-disclosed them to \nhis facility security officer, who made a Joint Personnel Adjudicative System (JPAS) \nentry in August 2016. (Item 7) The back taxes were from tax years 2008 and 2009, \nbefore his back injury. He has done nothing to address these tax delinquencies aside \nfrom two half-hearted repayment plans with the IRS. He did not follow through with his \nobligations to the bankruptcy trustee in 1994. His wife\u2019s unemployment and his own \nhealth issues were issues beyond his control. He has produced no relevant or \nresponsive documentation either with his answer to the SOR, or in response to the \nFORM, to show that he acted responsibly under these adverse circumstances. \nApplicant has the burden to provide sufficient evidence to show that his financial \nproblems are under control, and that his debts were incurred under circumstances \nmaking them unlikely to recur.  \n \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions fully apply. Applicant\u2019s credit reports and \nanswer to the SOR reflect delinquent tax debts and three unsatisfied judgments. \nApplicant did not provide enough details with documentary corroboration about what he \ndid to address his SOR debts. He did not provide documentation relating to any of the \n                                                          \n11 Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep 22, 2005) (An applicant has the \nburden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government). \n\n \n7 \n \n \nSOR debts: (1) proof of payments, such as checking account statements, photocopies \nof checks, or a letter from the creditor proving that he paid or made any payments to the \ncreditors; (2) correspondence to or from the creditors to establish maintenance of \ncontact;12 (3) credible debt disputes indicating he did not believe he was responsible for \nthe debts and why he held such a belief; (4) more evidence of attempts to negotiate \npayment plans, such as settlement offers or agreements to show that he was attempting \nto resolve these debts; or (5) other evidence of progress or resolution. Applicant failed \nto establish mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(e) because he did not provide documented proof \nto substantiate the existence, basis, or the result of any debt disputes. \n \n \nIn the FORM, Department Counsel informed Applicant that it was important for \nhim to provide corroborating or supporting documentation of resolution of the debts in \nthe SOR. (FORM at 3) Aside from Applicant\u2019s single payment to the IRS, there is no \ndocumentation that he has arranged for repayment of the consumer debts, medical \ndebts, or judgments. There is no documentary evidence that Applicant paid, arranged to \npay, settled, compromised, or otherwise resolved the SOR debts. The record lacks \ncorroborating or substantiating documentation and detailed explanations of the causes \nfor his financial problems and other mitigating information.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n       \n                                                          \n12 \u201cEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside \nhis [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable \nmanner when dealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. \n12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is \nwhether he or she maintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep \ndebts current.  \n\n \n8 \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines. Notably, Applicant has reached out to the IRS to \nattempt a repayment plan, but he provided no concrete evidence of any follow-through \nstream of payments. Most importantly, Applicant has not addressed the delinquent tax \nallegation and judgments in the SOR or the medical delinquencies. He has not met his \nburden of production.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s finances remain a security concern. There is insufficient evidence to \nconclude that Applicant\u2019s financial problems are under control. He has not met his \nburden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves me with serious questions and \ndoubts as to Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising under Guideline F, \nfinancial considerations.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.r:               Against Applicant  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Conclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n                                \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \n                                                    Robert J.
