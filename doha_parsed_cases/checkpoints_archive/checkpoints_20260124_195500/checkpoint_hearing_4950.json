After re-reading\nboth questions twice during his interview with the government\u2019s investigator, he realized he should\nhave disclosed the information.\u201d  \n\nApplicant holds a Bachelor of Science degree.  \n2\nApplicant Exhibit A at 1.\n3\n3\nB.  Discussion\nThe Appeal Board\u2019s review of the Judge\u2019s findings of facts is limited to determining if they\nare supported by substantial evidence\u2013such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as\nadequate to support such a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  Directive\n\u00b6  E3.1.32.1.  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing\ntwo inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency\u2019s findings\nfrom being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S.\n607, 620-21 (1966).  In evaluating the Judge\u2019s findings, we are required to give deference to the\nJudge\u2019s credibility determinations.  Directive  \u00b6  E3.1.32.1. \nDepartment Counsel challenges the findings placed in quotation marks above on the\ngrounds that they are not supported by the record, viewed as a whole.  Counsel observes that\nQuestions 24 and 26 are clear in their meaning.  Furthermore he cites Applicant\u2019s age, his level of\neducation,  the complexity of his professional responsibilities, and his admission that he has held a\n2\nclearance \u201cfor over 10 years\u201d  as reasons to believe Applicant was capable of understanding the\n3\nquestions.  Department Counsel argues that the record demonstrates Applicant to be an individual\n\u201cparticularly capable\u201d of understanding not only the SF86 but also his obligation to fill it out with\ndue care, and to be forthcoming about even embarrassing events.  Brief at 8.   \nThe Board finds Department Counsel argument persuasive.  It is not clear from the decision\nor from the record why the Judge found Applicant\u2019s explanation for his false statement to be\ncredible.  It is significant that, this case having been decided on the written record, the Judge did not\nhave an opportunity to evaluate Applicant\u2019s demeanor while testifying.  See ISCR Case 04-04302\nat  (App. Bd. Jun. 30, 2005) (\u201c[W]hen an applicant waives a hearing and chooses to have his or her\ncase decided by a Judge based on a written record, the Judge has no ability to make a credibility\ndetermination based on observation of the applicant\u2019s demeanor.  Accordingly, a credibility\ndetermination based solely on a written record is not entitled to the same deference on appeal as a\ncredibility determination based on observation of a witness\u2019s demeanor.\u201d) See also ISCR Case No.\n97-0752 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 4, 1998); ISCR Case No. 97-0625 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Aug. 17, 1998).  \nIn addition to the contrary facts listed above, we also note that, in his response to the FORM,\nApplicant contends that the questions at issue are ambiguous, in that neither mention the terms\n\u201carrested\u201d or \u201ccourt appearances.\u201d  However, as the Judge\u2019s own finding demonstrates, Question 26\ndoes in fact explicitly use the term \u201carrested.\u201d  Her decision does not address this apparent\ninconsistency with Applicant\u2019s response.  Nor does it address another factor, raised implicitly in\nApplicant\u2019s evidence attesting to his good job performance, that Applicant\u2019s concern over his\ncontinued employment provides a possible motive for not answering the questions truthfully.  All\nin all, the Judge\u2019s decision does not reflect serious consideration of the contrary record evidence.\nAccordingly, we are unable to conclude that the challenged findings are supported by substantial\n\n Department Counsel challenges another statement by the Judge, found in her Conclusions section, in which\n4\nshe says, \u201cApplicant\u2019s explanation that he did not intentionally withhold information, but instead misunderstood the\nquestion, is reasonable, and not contradicted by any substantive evidence from the Government.\u201d  Decision at 5.  The\nJudge has, through this sentence, effectively shifted the burden of persuasion to the Government.  That is, the Judge\u2019s\ndecision seems to imply that Applicant\u2019s denial of a knowing falsehood  required the government to produce additional\nevidence on that point beyond that already contained in the record.  The Government has no burden of persuasion in an\nISCR case.  See Directive  \u00b6   E3.1.15.  In any event, the Judge does not explain why those matters discussed in the text\nof this opinion do not, at least arguably, contradict Applicant\u2019s denial.      \n4\nrecord evidence.4\n  We believe that the appropriate remedy in this case is to remand it to the Judge for a new\ndecision, one in which her findings take into account all the record evidence on the question of\nApplicant\u2019s knowledge and intent in his response to Questions 24 and 26.  The decision should\naddress those matters identified in this opinion as bearing on the issue, as well as any others fairly\nraised by the evidence.  The remaining issues on appeal are not ripe for adjudication.  \nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s decision granting Applicant a clearance is REMANDED. \nSigned: Michael Y. Ra\u2019anan        \nMichael Y.

He has held a security clearance for more than ten years.  When he filled out\nhis security clearance application in 2002 to update his record, he did not disclose two 2001 criminal\ncharges.  He failed to mitigate the security concerns raised by his personal conduct.  Clearance is\ndenied.\nREMAND STATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn May 8, 2002, Applicant completed a security clearance application (SCA).  On August\n3, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, as amended, and Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January\n2, 1992, as amended, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant.  The SOR detailed reasons\nunder Guidelines E (Personal Conduct) and J (Criminal Conduct) why DOHA could not make a\npreliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant a security clearance to Applicant.  DOHA recommended the case be referred to an\nadministrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted.\nOn August 24, 2005, Applicant filed his Answer and elected to have the case decided on the\nwritten record in lieu of a hearing.  On July 28, 2006, Department Counsel prepared a File of\nRelevant Material (FORM) and provided Applicant with a complete copy on July 11, 2006.\nApplicant had 30 days from receipt of the FORM to file objections and submit material in refutation,\nextenuation, or mitigation.  Applicant submitted additional information on August 9, 2006, without\nobjection from Department Counsel.  The case was assigned to me on August 16, 2006, and I\nsubsequently marked Applicant\u2019s submission as .Applicant Exhibit (AX) A (8 pages).\nOn August 31, 2006, I granted Applicant\u2019s security clearance.  Department Counsel appealed.\nOn May 21, 2007, the Appeal Board remanded the case and directed me to issue a new decision:\nIn which [my] findings take into account all the record evidence on the question of\nApplicant\u2019s knowledge and intent in his response to Questions 24 and 26. The decision\nshould address those matters identified in this opinion as bearing on the issues, as well as any\nothers fairly raised by the evidence. \nIn particular, the Appeal Board took issue with my credibility determination that was made without\na hearing on the personal conduct allegation.  The Appeal Board stated, \u201cIt is significant that, this\ncase having been decided on the written record, the [Administrative] Judge did not have an\nopportunity to evaluate Applicant\u2019s demeanor while testifying.\u201d ISCR Case No. 04-12680 at 3 (App.\nBd. May 21, 2007). The Appeal Board went on to comment about the inherent problem with making\na credibility determination without a hearing. Id.  It further stated in a footnote on page 2 that, \u201cThe\nJudge\u2019s favorable decision under Guideline J is not at issue in this appeal.\u201d \nBased on the credibility concerns raised by the Appeal Board and in the interest of facilitating\nthe search for the truth, on June 21, 2007, I issued an Order For Hearing in which I requested the\n\nAll pleadings and correspondence issued subsequent to the Remand Order are part of the record.\n1\n3\nparties to submit their views as to whether Applicant should be provided a hearing.  On June 29,\n2007, Department Counsel timely filed a Government Response to the Administrative Judge\u2019s\nProposal to Reopen Hearing.  In the pleading, Department Counsel opposed the reopening of the\nrecord and challenged an administrative judge\u2019s authority to order a hearing. On July 18, 2007,\nApplicant filed his request for a hearing. \nIn an effort to more thoroughly address the Appeal Board\u2019s concerns, on August 15, 2007,\nI entered an Order Setting Hearing for August 30, 2007, limiting the scope of the hearing to\nApplicant\u2019s state of mind when he completed the security clearance application and addressed the\nfalsification issue in subsequent documents. Two days later, Department Counsel filed an Emergency\nRequest for Clarification of Remand Order, requesting the Appeal Board to intervene and prohibit\nme from proceeding with the hearing.  On August 21, 2007, the Chairman of the Appeal Board\nissued a Memorandum for Chief Department Counsel and Applicant, noting that the Appeal Board\n\u201chad no authority to consider appeals which are interlocutory in nature.\u201d The Chairman declined to\ngrant the Department Counsel\u2019s requested relief.  On August 27, 2007, Department Counsel sent me\na letter, seeking clarification as to the procedures for the scheduled hearing.  On that same day, I\nresponded to Department Counsel\u2019s inquiry and copied Applicant.\nOn August 30, 2007, I held the scheduled hearing via a video-teleconference. Applicant was\npresent at a government facility in Boston, MA.  Department Counsel and I were present at DOHA\u2019s\noffices in Arlington, VA.  At the commencement of the hearing, I marked as Hearing Exhibits (HX)\n1 through 4, documents that are contained in the file.  DOHA received the hearing transcript on\n1\nSeptember 12, 2007.\nREMAND FINDINGS OF FACT\nBased on the entire record, including Applicant\u2019s testimony at the hearing, I make the\nfollowing findings of fact:\nApplicant is 50 years old. He has worked for a federal contractor since January 1984 and\nbecame a program manager in 2000-2001.  In that capacity he is responsible for obtaining contracts\nand running jobs for clients. (Tr. 25-27).  He earned a Bachelor of Science in Business Management\nin 1992. (Tr. 21).  He has held a security clearance for at least 10 years without interruption. (HX 4).\nAlthough he does not work with classified information regularly, he is familiar with handling\nclassified documents. (Tr. 28).  He submitted his security clearance application (SCA) on May 8,\n2002, for purposes of a periodic reinvestigation.\nIn June 2001, Applicant and his daughter attended a concert where he consumed three or four\nbeers over a four-hour period.  He departed the concert, and was arrested and taken to the police\nstation after he failed a field sobriety test..  He was subsequently charged with (Count 1) Operating\nUnder the Influence of Liquor (DUI), and (Count 2) Operating Negligently.  After a jury trial, he was\nacquitted of Count I and found guilty of Count 2.  He was ordered to pay a $325 fine. (HX 3 at 2-3).\nHis driver\u2019s license was suspended for six months because he refused to take a Breathalyzer test. (Tr.\n\nThe amount of the fine is not included in this record.\n2\n4\n9). \nOne month later Applicant was again arrested and taken to the police station where his car\nwas impounded.  He was then transported to court and charged with Operating With a Suspended\nLicense.  He paid the court costs and the matter was dismissed.   At the time of the arrest, he was\n2\ndriving his son\u2019s car to a repair shop when he was stopped because the car did not display a valid\nregistration sticker.  Applicant admitted he should not have been driving on a suspended license.\n(HX 3 at 3).\nDuring this 2001 time frame, Applicant was going through a difficult period, as he recently\nwas divorced and had his children living with him.  He normally does not drink during the week, but\nmay have a couple beers or a glass of wine on the weekend.  Alcohol has not caused him any\npersonal or work-related problems.  He has not been intoxicated \u201cin about 25 years.\u201d (HX 3 at 4).\nHe told one of his co-workers about the June incident, but did not report it to his employer because\nhe did not know he was required to do so. (Id. at 3)\nIn May 2002, Applicant completed a SCA to update his record.  In executing that form he\ncertified that his answers were \u201ctrue, complete, and correct\u201d to the best of his knowledge and belief.\nIn response to Question 24. Your Police Record - Alcohol/Drug Offenses: Have you ever been\ncharged with or convicted of any offenses(s) related to alcohol or drugs? For this item, report\ninformation regardless of whether the record in your case has been \u2018sealed\u2019 or otherwise stricken\nfrom the court record.  The single exception to this requirement is for certain convictions under the\nFederal Controlled Substances Act for which the court issued an expungement order under the\nauthority of 21 U.S.C. 844 or 18 U.S.C. 3607, Applicant answered \u201cNo,\u201d and did not disclose the\nJune 2001 alcohol related DUI or the Operating Negligently charge.  He did not think he was\nrequired to disclose the DUI because he interpreted the word \u201ccharged with\u201d to mean found guilty.\n(Tr. 13).  He \u201cwasn\u2019t found guilty on an alcohol or drug-related offense, so [he] put no.\u201d(Id.).  He\ndid not disclose the conviction for Operating Negligently because he did not \u201cfeel that that (sic) was\nrelated to drugs or alcohol.\u201d (Id.). \nIn response to Question 26. Your Police Record - Other Offenses: In the last 7 years have\nyou been arrested for, charged with, or convicted of any offense (s) not listed in modules 23, 22, 23,\n24 or 25? (Leave out traffic fines of less than $150 unless the violation was alcohol or drug related)\nFor this item, report information regardless of whether the record in your case has been \u2018sealed\u2019\nor otherwise stricken from the court record.  The single exception to this requirement is for certain\nconvictions under the Federal Controlled Substances Act for which the court issued an expungement\norder under the authority of 21 U.S.C. 844 or 18 U.S.C. 3607, Applicant answered \u201cNo,\u201d and did\nnot list the July 2001 arrest and charge for driving on a suspended license.  Again, he interpreted the\nquestion to require disclosure only if he had been found guilty.  Because the case was dismissed the\nday he went to court, he felt he did not need to disclose it. (Tr. 14).\nIn April 2004, Applicant was interviewed about his answers to the above two questions.\nAfter re-reading both questions twice during his interview with a government investigator, he\nrealized he should have disclosed the information. (HX 3 at 2).  In his August 2006 written response\nto the FORM, he denied that he intentionally withheld information from the Government. (HX 4).\n\n5\nHe argued that both \u201cquestions do not, in fact, reference the words \u2018arrested\u2019 or \u2018court appearances\u2019\nbut rather they refer to the terms \u2018convicted\u2019 and \u2018charged.\u2019  I believe these terms leave a lot of room\nfor misinterpretation.\u201d (Id. at 1).  At the hearing, he again asserted that he misunderstood the two\nquestions. (Tr. 29)  When pointed out to him during his testimony that Question 26 does mention\nthe word \u201carrested,\u201d he admitted he made a mistake in his written response because he did not have\nthe SCA or SOR in front of him while drafting the letter. (Tr. 20).  He did not have any difficulty\nunderstanding any other question on the SCA. (Tr. 29).\nAt the time he completed the SCA, Applicant was aware of the criminal charges in his\nbackground.  In response to a question about the Government\u2019s right to know of those incidents, he\ntestified, \u201cI think they should know about it if I was found guilty, that\u2019s why I didn\u2019t\u2013that\u2019s why I\nanswered no originally.  I would have thought the Government should know if I was found guilty.\u201d\n(Tr. 32).\nApplicant was uncertain whether he would have been embarrassed to disclose the criminal\ncharges on the SCA.  Although he does not think holding a security clearance is important for his\njob, he believes it would be inconvenient not to have one. (Tr. 30). \nTwo of Applicant\u2019s colleagues attest to his overall responsible character and trustworthiness,\nincluding the colleague to whom he reported the June 2001 incident.  His March 2006 work\nevaluation documents his above average job performance in multiple categories. (AX A at 3-8)\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive, Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access\nto Classified Information, sets forth criteria which must be evaluated when determining security\nclearance eligibility.  Within those adjudicative guidelines are factors to consider in denying or\nrevoking an individual\u2019s request for access to classified information (Disqualifying Conditions), and\nfactors to consider in granting an individual\u2019s request for access to classified information (Mitigating\nConditions).  By recognizing that individual circumstances of each case are different, the guidelines\nprovide substantive standards to assist an administrative judge in weighing the evidence in order to\nreach a fair, impartial and common sense decision.\nThe adjudicative process requires thorough consideration and review of all available, reliable\ninformation about the applicant, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, to arrive at a balanced\ndecision.  Enclosure 2 of the Directive describes the essence of scrutinizing all appropriate variables\nin a case as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d  In evaluating the disqualifying and mitigating conduct, an\nadministrative judge should consider: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6)\nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the\nconduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of\ncontinuation or recurrence.\nGranting an applicant\u2019s clearance for access to classified information is based on a high\ndegree of trust and confidence in the individual.  Accordingly, decisions under the Directive must\n\n6\ninclude consideration of not only the actual risk of disclosure of classified information, but also\nconsideration of any possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently compromise\nclassified information.  Any doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified\ninformation must be resolved in favor of protecting classified information. Directive, Enclosure 2,\n\u00b6 E2.2.2.   The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a judgment about\nan applicant\u2019s loyalty. Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.  Instead, it is a determination that an applicant\nhas not met the strict guidelines established by the Department of Defense for issuing a clearance.\nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal\nor professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being\neligible for access to classified information.  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531\n(1988).  The Directive presumes a rational connection between past proven conduct under any of the\ndisqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. ISCR Case\nNo. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).\nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the\ncorresponding burden of rebuttal shifts to the applicant to present evidence in refutation, extenuation,\nor mitigation sufficient to overcome the position of the government. ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3\n(App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002); Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden\nof demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his\nclearance.\u201d Id. \nREMAND CONCLUSIONS\nAfter reconsideration of all evidence and taking Applicant\u2019s testimony, I conclude the\nfollowing with respect to the allegations set forth in Paragraph 1 of the SOR:\nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nGuideline E articulates the Government\u2019s concern regarding personal conduct. \u201cA security\nconcern may exist when conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability,\nlack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate that\nthe person may not properly safeguard classified information.\u201d E2.A5.1.1. \nThe Government alleged that Applicant falsified his SCA by failing to disclose an alcohol\nrelated offense and a subsequent driving offense, which constituted a disqualification under Personal\nConduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) E2.A5.1.2.2: \u201cThe deliberate omission, concealment, or\nfalsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history\nstatement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications,\naward benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award\nfiduciary responsibilities.\u201d  Although Applicant admitted he failed to disclose the information, he\ndenied any intention to falsify his application throughout this proceeding.\nWhen a falsification allegation is controverted or denied, the government has the burden of\nproving it.  Proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove an applicant\u2019s state of\nmind when the omission occurred.  An administrative judge must consider the record evidence as\n\n7\na whole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial evidence concerning an applicant\u2019s\nstate of mind at the time the omission occurred.  See ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov.\n17, 2004) (explaining holding in ISCR Case No. 02-23133 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004).\nAfter listening and observing Applicant testify, his explanation that he did not intentionally\nwithhold information from the Government, but instead misunderstood the two questions, is not\ncredible.  He is an articulate intelligent individual, whom I believe did not misinterpret the words\n\u201ccharged with\u201d in Questions 24 and 26 by construing them to be limited to a finding of guilt.  His\nAugust 3, 2006 response to the FORM inaccurately claimed that both questions do not reference the\nword \u201carrest\u201d which is another reason he misunderstood the questions.  During his examination, he\nadmitted that Question 26 contained the words \u201carrested for\u201d and that he made another mistake in\nhis response because he did not have the SCA or SOR in front of him while drafting his answers.\nHowever, the hearing record reveals that the real reason he did not disclose the two incidents,\noccurring the previous year, was based on his belief that the Government did not have a right to\nknow of the conduct unless he was found guilty.  Because he was acquitted on the DUI and the later\ndriving charge was dismissed, he did not feel compelled to disclose the information.  The\nGovernment established a disqualification under PC DC E2.A5.1.2.2.\nAfter the Government raised a disqualification, the burden shifted to Applicant to mitigate\nor rebut the allegations. Three Personal Conduct Mitigating Conditions (PC MC) under this\nGuideline are potentially applicable: (1) E2.A5.1.3.1. \u201cThe information was unsubstantiated or not\npertinent to a determination of judgment, trustworthiness, or reliability;\u201d (2) E2.A5.1.3.2. \u201cThe\nfalsification was an isolated incident, was not recent, and the individual has subsequently provided\ncorrect information voluntarily; and (3) E2.A5.1.3.3. \u201cThe individual made prompt, good-faith\nefforts to correct the falsification before being confronted with the facts.\u201d \nApplicant failed to disclose information pertaining to past alcohol and criminal behavior that\nis quite pertinent to a determination of judgment, trustworthiness, or reliability in the security\nclearance process.  Hence, E2.A5.1.3.1. is not applicable.  Although the falsification was limited to\ntwo questions on Applicant\u2019s 2002 SCA, he did not provide the correct information voluntarily, nor\ndid he correct the falsification before being interviewed by the Government in 2004.  Consequently,\nthe two remaining PC MCs are not applicable.\nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating factors, and evaluating the evidence in the\ncontext of the whole person, including Applicant\u2019s years of holding a security clearance without any\nallegations of impropriety and his colleagues\u2019 support, I find that Applicant failed to mitigate the\npersonal conduct security concerns.  Accordingly, Guideline E is decided again Applicant.\nREMAND FORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by\nSection E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are as follows:\nParagraph 1 Guideline E (Personal Conduct)\nAGAINST  APPLICANT\n\n8\nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant\nREMAND DECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly not consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance.

He has spent the last 32 years in the U.S. and is a loyal and dedicated U.S. citizen.\nGiven the mitigating evidence submitted, and under the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept, Applicant has\nmitigated security concerns pertaining to foreign influence because of his strong connections to the\nU.S.  Under the specific facts in evidence, the government's security concerns have been mitigated.\nClearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn January 24, 2002, Applicant applied for a security clearance by submitting a Security\nClearance Application (SF 86).   On April 22, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n1\n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, pursuant to Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and\nmodified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified.  The SOR\ndetailed reasons under Guideline B (foreign influence) why DOHA could not make the preliminary\naffirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nor continue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge\nto determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.\nIn a sworn, written statement, dated May 10, 2005, Applicant responded to the SOR\nallegations and requested a hearing.  Department Counsel indicated the government was ready to\nproceed on June 2, 2005.  The case was assigned to me on June 8, 2005.  A notice of hearing was\nissued on June 14, 2005 and the hearing was held before me on June 22, 2005.  Applicant appeared\nat his hearing pro se.  During the hearing, six Government exhibits, eight Applicant exhibits, and\nApplicant\u2019s testimony were received.  The transcript (Tr.) was received on July 6, 2005.  On\nFebruary 21, 2006, I concluded that under the specific facts in evidence, the government\u2019s security\nconcerns had not been mitigated, and I issued a decision in which I found that it was not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest too grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nApplicant retained counsel, who filed a notice of appeal and submitted an appeal brief.  It is\nnot known if a reply brief was filed by the government.  My findings of fact were not challenged on\nappeal.  The Appeal Board considered \u201cWhether Applicant was denied due process under Executive\nOrder and the Directive.\u201d  \nOn November 2, 2006, the Appeal Board ruled that they \u201ccannot conclude with confidence\nthat Applicant received the due process provided for in Executive (Order) 10865 and the Directive.\u201d\nIn particular, the Appeal Board found merit in Applicant\u2019s argument that his pro se representation\nwas ineffective because Applicant was uninformed about the hearing process, the meaning of the\nrules of evidence, the role of the Administrative Judge, and what evidence could be produced at the\nhearing.  As a result, Applicant contends that Applicant missed opportunities to produce evidence\n\nSee Appeal Board Decision, ISCR Case No. 04-12732, dated November 2, 2006.\n2\nAs previously noted, Applicant appeared at his first hearing pro se.  At his second hearing, he appeared with\n3\ncounsel and as a result his representation was significantly enhanced.\n3\nat the hearing.  Accordingly, the Appeal Board remanded the case to me with instructions that the\ncase be reopened and that Applicant be given an opportunity to have a new hearing.2\nThe case was subsequently reassigned to me on November 8, 2006.  I conducted a new\nhearing on December 19, 2006.\nThe government submitted seven documents that were marked as Government Exhibits (GE)\n1 through 7 without objections.  Applicant submitted 30 documents that were previously marked as\nApplicant Exhibits (AE) 1 through 30 without objections.  DOHA received the transcript on\nDecember 28, 2006.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nBecause my Findings of Fact were not challenged on appeal, those set forth in my initial\ndecision, dated February 21, 2006, are hereby incorporated herein as though they were expressly re-\nwritten below.\nAt his second hearing, Applicant developed additional facts which supplement, complement,\nor clarify facts presented at his first hearing.   Those facts are as follows:\n3\nApplicant\u2019s wife holds a bachelor of science degree in medical technology, and is employed\nas a senior scientist in a hospital laboratory.  \nApplicant has two U.S. born children, a daughter and a son.  His daughter is a college senior\nmajoring in psychology, and his son is a college freshman majoring in computer science.  \nApplicant described his relationship with his parents as \u201c[b]asically, nonexistent,\u201d adding,\n\u201c[t]hey decided not to get involved with my life and we just left it alone.  They don\u2019t call; we don\u2019t\ncall.\u201d  Tr. 117.  Applicant last contacted his parents by telephone in March 2004 or 2005.  Tr. 116-\n117.  Applicant\u2019s father is 78-years-old and his mother is 74-years-old.  Applicant further stated that\nhe has had no contact whatsoever with any of his Iranian relatives in the past six to twelve months.\nHe has no trips planned to Iran nor are any of his relatives planning to visit the U.S.  \nApplicant has no assets in Iran.  Conversely, he estimates his assets to be as follows: a home\nvalued at $850,000, four automobiles valued at $90,000, and a 401(K) plan valued at $120,000.\nApplicant\u2019s gross salary is $84,000 and his wife\u2019s gross salary is $65,000.  Applicant estimates his\ntotal assets to include real estate, automobiles, life insurance, bank accounts, and IRAs to be worth\n$1.5 million dollars. \nApplicant regularly votes in elections and exercises all rights of a U.S. citizen.  Applicant\nreaffirmed his loyalty to the U.S.  \n\n4\nApplicant stated if he were approached by an individual from Iran or other country seeking\nsensitive or classified information, he would immediately report such contact to the appropriate\nauthorities. \nApplicant called eight character witnesses on his behalf.  These witnesses included senior\ncompany officials, co-workers, and friends.  Included among those witnesses were individuals with\nlengthy government experience, who hold clearances, and understand the process and importance\nof carefully vetting those granted clearances.  Some of Applicant\u2019s witnesses have known him since\ncollege.  In any event, all his witnesses expressed a very high opinion of Applicant.  Applicant also\nsubmitted 30 exhibits which included personal recommendations, copies of his diplomas,\nperformance evaluations, and various certificates, and a profile of Applicant.  The collective sense\nof these witnesses and personal recommendations overwhelmingly portray Applicant as an individual\npossessing exceptional integrity, honesty, family values, strong work ethic, and loyalty to the U.S.\nThose who know Applicant through work stated he is an employee who has contributed substantially\nto the U.S. defense effort and who possesses unlimited potential for future potential.\nAt the remand hearing, the government offered three documents prepared by the U.S.\nGovernment on Iran.  Those documents are U.S. Department of State, Bureau of Consular Affairs,\nWashington, DC, \u201cConsular Information Sheet, dated June 2, 2005, CRS Report for Congress, \u201cIran:\nU.S. Concerns and Policy Responses,\u201d dated April 15, 2005, and U.S. State Department, Bureau of\nConsular Affairs, Washington, DC, \u201cTravel Warning,\u201d dated October 10, 2006.  GE 5 through 7,\nrespectively.  GE 6 and 7 were previously offered at Applicant\u2019s initial hearing.  I considered these\ndocuments in their entirety.\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be considered in\nthe evaluation of security suitability.  In addition to brief introductory explanations for each\nguideline, the adjudicative guidelines are divided into those that may be considered in deciding\nwhether to deny or revoke an individual's eligibility for access to classified information\n(Disqualifying Conditions) and those that may be considered in deciding whether to grant an\nindividual's eligibility for access to classified information (Mitigating Conditions).\nAn administrative judge need not view the adjudicative guidelines as inflexible ironclad rules\nof law.  Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines, when applied\nin conjunction with the factors set forth in the Adjudicative Process provision set forth in Section\nE.2.2., Enclosure 2, of the Directive, are intended to assist the administrative judge in reaching fair\nand impartial common sense decisions.\nBecause the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept,\u201d all available, reliable information about the person, past and present,\nfavorable and unfavorable, should be considered in making a meaningful decision.  The Adjudicative\nProcess factors which an administrative judge should consider are: (1) the nature, extent, and\nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at\nthe time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the\n\nThe Directive, as amended by Change 4, dated April 20, 1999, uses \u201cclearly consistent with the national\n4\ninterest\u201d (Sec. 2.3.; Sec. 2.5.3.; Sec. 3..2.; and Sec. 4.2.; Enclosure 3, Sec. E3.1.1.; Sec. E3.1.2.; Sec. E3.1.25.); Sec.\nE3.1.26.; and Sec. E3.1.27.), \u201cclearly consistent with the interests of national security\u201d (Enclosure 2, Sec. E2.2.3.); and\n\u201cclearly consistent with national security\u201d (Enclosure 2, Sec. E2.2.2.).\n5\npotential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\nBased upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative\nguideline most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:\n[GUIDELINE B - FOREIGN INFLUENCE]:  A security risk may exist when an\nindividual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom he or she\nmay be bound by affection, influence, or obligation are not citizens of the United States or may\nbe subject to duress.  These situations could create the potential for foreign influence that\ncould result in the compromise of classified information.  Contacts with citizens of other\ncountries or financial interests in other countries are also relevant to security determinations\nif they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.\nConditions that could raise security a concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those\nwhich could mitigate security concerns, pertaining to the adjudicative guideline are set forth and\ndiscussed in the Conclusions section below.\nSince the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision\nin each case must be arrived at by applying the standard that the issuance of the clearance is \u201cclearly\nconsistent with the interests of national security\u201d or \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest.\u201d4\nFor the purposes herein, despite the different language in each, I have concluded all of the standards\nare the same.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable,\nlogical and based on the evidence contained in the record.  Likewise, I have avoided drawing\ninferences that are grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nIn the decision-making process, the burden of producing evidence initially falls on the\ngovernment to establish a case which demonstrates, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant's access to classified\ninformation.  If the government meets its burden, the heavy burden of persuasion then falls upon the\napplicant to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to\novercome the doubts raised by the government's case, and to ultimately demonstrate it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue the applicant's clearance.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with\nthe government predicated upon trust and confidence.  It is a relationship that transcends normal duty\nhours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well.  It is because of this special relationship that\nthe government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to\nwhom it grants access to classified information.  Decisions under this Directive include, by necessity,\nconsideration of the possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect\nor safeguard classified information.  Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible\nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n\nThe SOR alleged Applicant\u2019s brother-in-law was a citizen and resident of Iran (SOR \u00b6 1.b.).  I concluded at\n5\nApplicant\u2019s first hearing that he had mitigated this allegation.  As such, my discussion is focused on unmitigated concerns\nto relatives whose connections to Applicant were not mitigated (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1. a. and 1.b.). \nFor an expansive discussion of Appeal Board decisions under Guideline B, see the decision of Administrative\n6\nJudge Michael J. Breslin, in ISCR Case No. 03-21434 at 7-17 (May 24, 2006).\n6\nOne additional comment is worthy of note.  Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism\nare not at issue in these proceedings.  Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically provides\nindustrial security clearance decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense\nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  Security clearance decisions cover\nmany characteristics of an applicant other than allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism.  Nothing in this\ndecision should be construed to suggest I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any\nexpress or implied decision as to Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.\nCONCLUSIONS\nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, an assessment of credibility, and after\napplication of all appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly\nabove, I conclude the following with respect to each allegation set forth in the SOR:\nApplicant is a potential security risk because members of his immediate family or persons\nto whom he is bound by affection, influence, or obligation\u2014in this instance, Applicant's elderly\nparents and two of his siblings\u2014are either not citizens or residents of the United States or may be\nsubject to duress.  This situation raises the potential for vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or\npressure, and the exercise of foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified\ninformation.  In support of its contentions, the government has shown that his relatives are Iranian\ncitizens residing in Iran.  Based on a review of the evidence previously presented at his first hearing\nand, more importantly, evidence presented at his remand hearing, I conclude that Applicant has\nmitigated these security concerns.\nApplicant's parents and sisters are citizens of and reside in Iran.   Those simple facts, standing\n5\nalone, are sufficient to raise security concerns over the possibility of Applicant's vulnerability to\ncoercion, exploitation, or pressure.  However, the mere possession of family ties with a person in a\nforeign country is not, as a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B.   \n6\nThe government\u2019s evidence points to the presence of terrorist activity in Iran.  The apparent\nthrust of raising this point was the need for heightened awareness regarding applicant vulnerability\nto terrorist threats in Iran and the presence of Applicant\u2019s family in that country.  While there may\nbe some merit to the overall argument, it must be remembered that terrorist cells also actively\noperate in even more western nations, such as England, Germany, Spain, and Italy.  And, as shown\nby the events of 9/11, they also operate here in the U.S.  \nFor the past 32 years, Applicant has lived in the U.S.  He has raised his family here, owns\nall his real and personal property owner here, and has all his financial holdings here.  He is fully\nvested in the U.S. and integrated in the American way of life.  As mentioned in my previous\nDecision, Applicant had not spoken to his parents for 15 years following a family rift.  His contact\n\nISCR Case No. 03-11448 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, 2004); ISCR Case No. 02-09389 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 29,\n7\n2004).\nISCR Case No. 03-17620 at 4 (App. Bd. Apr. 17, 2006) (footnotes omitted); accord ISCR Case No. 03-23259\n8\nat 3 (App. Bd. May 10, 2006).\n7\nwith his parents and sisters is virtually non-existent, especially for the past year.  Applicant has no\nfinancial interests in Iran.\nThe residence and citizenship of some of Applicant's family members constitute a security\nconcern under Foreign Influence Disqualifying Condition (FI DC) E2.A2.1.2.1. (an immediate family\nmember, or a person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of,\nor resident or present in, a foreign country), but the significance of that conclusion is mitigated by\nForeign Influence Mitigating Condition (FI MC) E2.A2.1.3.1. (a determination that the immediate\nfamily member(s), (spouse, father, mother, sons, daughters, brothers, sisters), cohabitant, or\nassociate(s) in question are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a\nforeign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the person(s)\ninvolved and the United States); FI MC E2.A2.1.3.3. (contact and correspondence with foreign\ncitizens are casual and infrequent); and FI MC E2.A2.1.3.5 (foreign financial interests are minimal\nand not sufficient to affect the individual\u2019s security responsibilities).\nWhether an applicant\u2019s family ties in a foreign country pose a security risk depends on a\ncommon sense evaluation of the overall facts and circumstances of those family ties.  None of\nApplicant\u2019s family members in Iran meet the definition of \u201cagent of a foreign power\u201d under 50\nU.S.C. \u00a7 438(6) and 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1801(b).  Similarly, none of them would be considered as an \u201cagent\nof a foreign power\u201d under the more expansive definition adopted by the Appeal Board.  Except for\nhis elderly father, who retired from the Iranian Army in 1985, and resides in retirement in Iran, all\nof the remaining family members are either retired or employed in non-governmental capacities in\nthe private sector. \nAs noted above, the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d is the heart of the analysis of whether an\napplicant is eligible for a security clearance.   In assessing whether an applicant is a security risk\n7\nbecause of his or her relatives or associates in a foreign country, it is necessary to consider all\nrelevant factors.  In fact, the Appeal Board has repeatedly held:\nAlthough the position of an applicant\u2019s foreign family members is significant and\nmay preclude the favorable application of Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition 1,\nthe totality of an applicant\u2019s conduct and circumstances (including the realistic\npotential for exploitation) may still warrant a favorable application of the relevant\ngeneral factors.8\nOne factor which must be considered is \u201cthe potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation,\nor duress.\u201d  In that regard, it is important consider the character of the foreign power in question,\nincluding the government and entities controlled by the government, within the relevant foreign\ncountry.  Nothing in Guideline B suggests it is limited to countries that are hostile to the United\n\nSee ISCR Case No. 00-0317 at 6 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2002); ISCR Case No. 00-0489 at 12 (App. Bd. Jan. 10,\n9\n2002).\nISCR Case No. 00-0317 at 6 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2002).\n10\n8\nStates.   In fact, the Appeal Board has cautioned against \u201creliance on overly simplistic distinctions\n9\nbetween \u2018friendly\u2019 nations and \u2018hostile\u2019 nations when adjudicating cases under Guideline B.\u201d10\nNevertheless, the relationship between a foreign government and the U.S. may be relevant in\ndetermining whether a foreign government or an entity it controls is likely to attempt to exploit a\nresident or citizen to against the U.S. through the applicant.  It is reasonable to presume that a\nfriendly relationship, or the existence of a democratic government, is not determinative, but it may\nmake it less likely that a foreign government would attempt to exploit a U.S. citizen through relatives\nor associates in that foreign country.\nThere are many countervailing positive attributes to Applicant\u2019s life as a U.S. citizen that\nweigh towards granting his clearance.  His Iranian passport has long since expired.  He has the\nfollowing strong links or connections to the U.S.: (1) Applicant became a U.S. citizen, (2) His\nIranian born wife because a U.S. citizen, (3) His two college age children are U.S. born citizens, (4)\nHis only brother who was born in Iran immigrated to the U.S. and became a U.S. citizen, (5)\nApplicant and his wife are hard working, productive citizens, who are making a daily contribution\nto society, (6) All of Applicant\u2019s real and personal property are in the U.S., (7) Conversely,\nApplicant has no financial interests in Iran, (8) Applicant\u2019s contact with his elderly parents and two\nsisters in Iran is virtually non-existent, (9) Applicant\u2019s work supervisors, colleagues, and friends hold\na very high view of Applicant, and (10) Applicant credibly stated that he would never do anything\nto harm the U.S. and promptly report to appropriate authority any improper contact by a foreign\nagent.  \nEqually as important is the necessity of considering Applicant\u2019s vulnerability to exploitation\nthrough his relatives.  Applicant\u2014a naturalized U.S. citizen since 2000\u2014is a mature individual with\nvery close ties to the U.S.  His wife and his brother are naturalized U.S. citizens, and his two children\nare U.S. born U.S. citizens.  Because of Applicant\u2019s deep and long-standing relationships and\nloyalties in and to the U.S., he can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S.\nConsequently, I find the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress does not constitute\na security risk.  Thus, I conclude on remand Applicant has, through new evidence of extenuation and\nexplanation, successfully mitigated and overcome the government's case with respect to Guideline\nB.  Accordingly, allegations 1.a. through 1.c. of the SOR are concluded in favor of Applicant.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25. of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1., Guideline B:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.:\nFor Applicant\n\n9\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

See also Government\nExhibit (GE) 1, SCA dated Feb. 25, 2002, at 2.  \n2\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On July 27, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline L (Outside Activities), Guideline\nB (Foreign Influence), and Guideline K (Handling Protected Information) of Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  DOHA amended the SOR on January 12,\n2010, raising security concerns under Guideline E (Personal Conduct).  Applicant requested a\nhearing.  On September 29, 2010, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Michael H. Leonard\ndenied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6\nE3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge failed to consider all of\nthe record evidence; whether the Judge erred in his application of the Guideline K mitigating\nconditions; and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nAt the hearing, Department Counsel withdrew the Guideline L and Guideline B concerns.\nAdditionally, the Judge made favorable findings under Guideline E.  Therefore, the allegations\npresented under those Guidelines are not at issue in this appeal.  Consistent with the following\ndiscussion, we affirm the decision of the Judge.  \nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant is employed by a Federal\nresearch and development contractor.  Additionally, she owns and operates a consulting firm.  She\npreviously served as an employee of another Government agency for 30 years.1  In that capacity, she\nheld a security clearance, which was last adjudicated by the other Government agency in 1995.  In\n2003 she submitted a security clearance application (SCA) to the Department of Defense for a\nperiodic reinvestigation. \nApplicant committed four security infractions while serving in a high-level Government\nposition in 1998.  Each time she was warned that continued infractions could result in disciplinary\naction.  These incidents involved circumstances in which classified materials were not properly\nsafeguarded.  However, there was no actual or probable compromise of them.  These four infractions\nformed the basis of the SOR allegations under Guideline K.  In addition to those alleged in the SOR,\nApplicant committed eleven other security infractions from 1985 to 1997.  Almost all of them\noccurred in a U.S. facility abroad.  These incidents resulted in warnings, counselings, or briefings\nby security officials.  The Judge quoted a security officer who, in regard to a 1990 incident, briefed\nApplicant that unless her \u201chabits change more violations will be likely.\u201d  Decision at 4.  Applicant\ncommitted about ten more infractions subsequent to this briefing.  \nApplicant\u2019s current duties include access to classified information during meetings and\nbriefings.  She has not physically handled classified information since retiring from the Government.\n\n2Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 35(a): \u201cso much time has elapsed since the behavior, or it has happened so infrequently\nor under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment[.]\u201d\n3Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 35(b): \u201cthe individual responded favorably to counseling or remedial security training\nand now demonstrates a positive attitude toward the discharge of security responsibilities[.]\u201d\n4Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 35(c): \u201cthe security violations were due to improper or inadequate training.\u201d\n3\nIn the Analysis portion of the Decision, the Judge considered three mitigating conditions:\n35(a),2 35(b),3 and 35(c).4  Concluding that the first of these was the most pertinent, he\nacknowledged that over ten years had elapsed since Applicant\u2019s last security infraction.  He\ncharacterized ten years as \u201ca commonsense measurement of recency and remoteness.\u201d  Decision at\n12.  However, he also noted that, since retiring from the Government, Applicant has not had an\nopportunity actually to handle classified information, with the result that she has not had an\nopportunity to demonstrate that she had corrected her poor habits.  \u201c[W]ithout substantial evidence\nof change or reform of Applicant\u2019s security habits, it is reasonable to expect Applicant\u2019s future to\nbe more like the past, which is a record of repeated security infractions despite repeated cautions to\nthe contrary.\u201d  Id.  He stated that, under the facts of this case, the mere passage of time in and of\nitself was not sufficient to demonstrate changed conduct.\nApplicant contends that the Judge failed to consider all of the record evidence, for example\nevidence that her infractions occurred under difficult circumstances not likely to recur and evidence\nthat the other Government agency granted Applicant a clearance despite her infractions.  Also,\nApplicant has submitted a letter from an official of her previous agency, which is not contained in\nthe record.\nA Judge is presumed to have considered all the evidence in the record.  See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 09-01735 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 31, 2010).  A Judge is not required to discuss every piece of\nrecord evidence, a practical impossibility in any event and especially in a record as voluminous as\nthis.  The Judge discussed record evidence of the high quality of Applicant\u2019s service to the\nGovernment, acknowledging that some of it \u201cwas quite powerful.\u201d  Decision at 15.  Applicant\u2019s\nsubmission on appeal provides no reason to conclude that the Judge did not consider her testimony\nas to the trying circumstances surrounding many, but not all, of her infractions.\nNeither is there any reason to conclude that the Judge failed to consider record evidence of\nthe prior adjudication by the other Government agency.  Applicant herself casts her argument more\nin terms of the weight which the Judge assigned to the evidence rather than an absolute failure to\nconsider it per se.  Viewing Applicant\u2019s argument in light of the entire record, we find no reason to\nconclude that the Judge mis-weighed the evidence.\nThe new evidence which Applicant has submitted consists of a letter which refers to events\nin 1999.  We have repeatedly held that jurisdictional defects can be raised at any time including on\nappeal.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-05632 at 2 (App. Bd. May 13, 2008); ISCR Case No. 06-19169\nat 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 2, 2007).  For that limited purpose only, we have considered Applicant\u2019s new\n\n4\nevidence.  Even if we read that statement in a light most favorable to Applicant, we do not conclude\nthat, when DOHA issued the SOR in 2009, there was any current investigation or adjudication of\nApplicant in place by any other agency.  Therefore, the reciprocity provisions of Executive Order\n13467 and the National Industrial Security Program Manual cited by Applicant on appeal are not\npertinent on these facts.  We also decline to conclude that DOHA was precluded from considering\npast conduct in the context of a current adjudication.  This is the case even where the past conduct\nwas considered in a prior favorable adjudication.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-10859 at 4 (App. Bd.\nSep. 2, 2010); ISCR Case No. 08-09163 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Dec 21, 2010).   \nWe have considered Applicant\u2019s challenge to the Judge\u2019s treatment of the mitigating\nconditions, paying special note to her argument that sufficient time has passed so as to justify the\nfavorable application of 35(a).  However, once it is established that an applicant has committed a\nsecurity violation, he or she has a \u201cvery heavy burden\u201d in her efforts to demonstrate mitigation.  See\nISCR Case No. 06-21537 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 21, 2008).  In the case under consideration here, the\nJudge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant has had no opportunity in the years since her last infraction to\ndemonstrate rehabilitation is reasonable.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08119 at 8 (App. Bd. Jul. 8,\n2010) (The years intervening between the applicant\u2019s last known security infraction and the date of\nthe SOR included an 18 month period in which Applicant did not hold a clearance, thereby vitiating\nhis argument that the absence of infractions during the intervening years demonstrated\nrehabilitation). \nThe record supports a conclusion that the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated\na satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found\nand the choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

    "discussion": ", we affirm the decision of the Judge. The Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant is employed by a Federal research and development contractor. Additionally, she owns and operates a consulting firm. She previously served as an employee of another Government agency for 30 years.1 In that capacity, she held a security clearance, which was last adjudicated by the other Government agency in 1995. In 2003 she submitted a security clearance application (SCA) to the Department of Defense for a periodic reinvestigation. Applicant committed four security infractions while serving in a high-level Government position in 1998. Each time she was warned that continued infractions could result in disciplinary action.

Applicant committed about ten more infractions subsequent to this briefing. Applicant\u2019s current duties include access to classified information during meetings and briefings. She has not physically handled classified information since retiring from the Government. 2Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 35(a): \u201cso much time has elapsed since the behavior, or it has happened so infrequently or under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment[.]\u201d 3Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 35(b): \u201cthe individual responded favorably to counseling or remedial security training and now demonstrates a positive attitude toward the discharge of security responsibilities[.]\u201d 4Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 35(c): \u201cthe security violations were due to improper or inadequate training.\u201d 3 In the Analysis portion of the Decision, the Judge considered three mitigating conditions: 35(a),2 35(b),3 and 35(c).4 Concluding that the first of these was the most pertinent, he acknowledged that over ten years had elapsed since Applicant\u2019s last security infraction. He characterized ten years as \u201ca commonsense measurement of recency and remoteness.\u201d Decision at 12. However, he also noted that, since retiring from the Government, Applicant has not had an opportunity actually to handle classified information, with the result that she has not had an opportunity to demonstrate that she had corrected her poor habits. \u201c[W]ithout substantial evidence of change or reform of Applicant\u2019s security habits, it is reasonable to expect Applicant\u2019s future to be more like the past, which is a record of repeated security infractions despite repeated cautions to the contrary.\u201d Id. He stated that, under the facts of this case, the mere passage of time in and of itself was not sufficient to demonstrate changed conduct. Applicant contends that the Judge failed to consider all of the record evidence, for example evidence that her infractions occurred under difficult circumstances not likely to recur and evidence that the other Government agency granted Applicant a clearance despite her infractions. Also, Applicant has submitted a letter from an official of her previous agency, which is not contained in the record. A Judge is presumed to have considered all the evidence in the record. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 09-01735 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 31, 2010). A Judge is not required to discuss every piece of record evidence, a practical impossibility in any event and especially in a record as voluminous as this. The Judge discussed record evidence of the high quality of Applicant\u2019s service to the Government, acknowledging that some of it \u201cwas quite powerful.\u201d Decision at 15. Applicant\u2019s submission on appeal provides no reason to conclude that the Judge did not consider her testimony as to the trying circumstances surrounding many, but not all, of her infractions. Neither is there any reason to conclude that the Judge failed to consider record evidence of the prior adjudication by the other Government agency. Applicant herself casts her argument more in terms of the weight which the Judge assigned to the evidence rather than an absolute failure to consider it per se. Viewing Applicant\u2019s argument in light of the entire record, we find no reason to conclude that the Judge mis-weighed the evidence. The new evidence which Applicant has submitted consists of a letter which refers to events in 1999. We have repeatedly held that jurisdictional defects can be raised at any time including on appeal.

Kies, Esq.   \n                     \n           \n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to revoke eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance. Under Guideline E, Applicant\u2019s past and current service as a non-\nexecutive director of certain corporate boards does not demonstrate such questionable\njudgment that it should disqualify Applicant from access to classified information. But\nunder Guideline K, Applicant\u2019s record of repeated security infractions is not mitigated.\nAccordingly, as explained in further detail below, this case is decided against Applicant.\nSeptember 29, 2010\n\n  This case is adjudicated under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry,\n1\nsigned by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended, as well as DoD Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program, dated January 2, 1992, as amended\n(Directive). In addition, the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified\nInformation (AG), effective within the Defense Department on September 1, 2006, apply to this case. The AG\nwere published in the Federal Register and codified in 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 154, Appendix H (2006). The AG replace\nthe guidelines in Enclosure 2 to the Directive. \n Appellate Exhibit 1. \n2\n2\nStatement of the Case\nActing under the relevant Executive Order and DoD Directive,  on July 27, 2009,\n1\nthe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (the Agency) issued a statement of\nreasons (SOR) explaining it was unable to find it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant access to classified information. The SOR is similar to a\ncomplaint, and it detailed the factual basis for the action under the security guidelines\nknown as Guideline L for outside activities, Guideline B for foreign influence, and\nGuideline K for handling protected information. The SOR also recommended that the\ncase be submitted to an administrative judge to decide whether to deny or revoke\nApplicant\u2019s security clearance.  \nApplicant answered with a 30-page reply, dated October 9, 2009, and requested\na hearing. Three months later, the Agency amended the SOR by adding a new factual\nbasis under the security guideline known as Guideline E for personal conduct. Applicant\nanswered with a 11-page reply, dated January 28, 2010, and the reply included a\nsubmission urging withdrawal of allegations and a supporting memorandum of law. \nThe case was assigned to me March 13, 2010. A pre-hearing conference was\nheld via conference call on March 25, 2010. The pre-hearing conference was\nsummarized in a memorandum and made part of the record.  \n2\nThe hearing took place over five sessions during May and July 2010. Both\nDepartment Counsel and Applicant submitted a large number of documentary exhibits.\nDepartment Counsel called no witnesses, while Applicant testified and called four\nwitnesses. During closing arguments, Department Counsel withdrew the SOR\nallegations under Guidelines L and B. Accordingly, those matters will not be addressed\nother than in the formal findings. \nThe last of the five volumes of the hearing transcript (Tr.) was received July 30,\n2010. For citation purposes, the transcript is referred to by volume number (in\nchronological order) and page number. For example, if referring to page 99 of the first\nvolume (from May 14, 2010), the citation is Tr. 1: 99, for the third volume (from May 25,\n2010), the citation is Tr. 3: 99, and so on. \n\n Appellate Exhibits 14 and 19. \n3\n Appellate Exhibits 20 and 21. \n4\n Given the size of the record, along with an effort to protect Applicant\u2019s privacy, a summarized approach to\n5\nthe findings of fact is appropriate. I have attempted to strike a balance between providing enough information\nso the parties understand the basis of the decision while at the same time protecting Applicant\u2019s privacy.   \n Exhibit X. \n6\n Tr. 3: 67\u201368. \n7\n Exhibits 7 and III.\n8\n Exhibit 1. \n9\n Exhibit 5.\n10\n3\nPost-hearing briefing was directed,  and counsel submitted their briefs  by the\n3\n4\nAugust 27, 2010 deadline. Counsel are commended for their excellent work, and I note\nthat the post-hearing briefs were particularly helpful in deciding this case. \nFindings of Fact\nBased on the evidence as a whole, the following facts are established by\nsubstantial evidence.5\nApplicant is employed by a \n organization that does research and\ndevelopment for the federal government. As a senior fellow, Applicant is considered a\npart-time on-call employee. In addition, Applicant owns and operates a consulting firm.\nBefore that, Applicant served as an employee of the U.S. Government for more than 30\nyears in various assignments in the United States and abroad. Applicant\u2019s governmental\nservice included \n \n \n \n positions.  In addition to consulting,\n6\nApplicant\u2019s post-government career includes serving on corporate boards, some of\nwhich is at issue in this case. \nApplicant is seeking to retain a security clearance as it is a condition of\nemployment with the \n organization.  Applicant held a security clearance for\n7\nmany years as an employee of the U.S. Government, which last adjudicated Applicant\u2019s\nclearance in about 1995.  That clearance was transferred to the Defense Department\n8\nwhen Applicant began her employment with the \n organization in 2000. Then in\n2003, Applicant submitted a security clearance application to the Defense Department\nfor a periodic reinvestigation.  It is the 2003 application that is under consideration here.\n9\n1.\nSummary of Applicant\u2019s security infractions (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a\u20133.e)\nWhile serving in a \n \n position in 1998, Applicant committed\nfour security infractions.  As a result, Applicant was warned that continued violations\n10\n\n Exhibit AAA.\n11\n Id. \n12\n Exhibit 16. \n13\n See Exhibits 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15. \n14\n Exhibit 10. \n15\n Exhibit 16.\n16\n Tr. 3: 68\u201369. \n17\n Exhibit I. \n18\n Exhibit KKK at 36.\n19\n4\nwould result in loss of pay. All four incidents were infractions (as opposed to violations),\nwhich under the applicable rules meant that materials were not properly safeguarded,\nbut did not result in the actual or probable compromise of the materials.  The four\n11\ninfractions occurred within a controlled access area, which is an area where classified\ninformation may be handled, stored, discussed, or processed.12\nAlthough not alleged in the SOR, the evidence also establishes that Applicant\ncommitted 11 security infractions during the period 1985\u20131997.  Nearly all infractions\n13\ntook place within a U.S. facility abroad. A review of the relevant paperwork shows\nApplicant was warned, counseled, or briefed multiple times by security officials in light of\nthe infractions.  For example, in 1990, when Applicant was briefed on the need to\n14\nfollow a clean-desk policy and the proper storage of classified information, the security\nofficer who briefed Applicant observed that \u201c[u]nless the habits change more violations\nwill be likely.\u201d  That observation proved accurate as about ten more infractions followed\n15\nduring  1992\u20131998.  \n16\nApplicant currently has access to classified information,  but not anywhere near\n17\nthe frequency when working for the government. As a part-time on-call employee,\nApplicant does not have an office, desk, or cubical at the organization. When working\nthere, Applicant typically has access to classified information when participating in\nmeetings and briefings, although Applicant has not physically handled classified\ninformation since retiring from the government.  \n2.\nSummary of Applicant\u2019s involvement with a \n \n \ncompany during \n (SOR \u00b6 4.a)\nAfter retiring from the government, Applicant served as a non-executive director\non the board of a \n \n \n \n company \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n.  The \n company was incorporated in\n18\napproximately 1999.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n19\n\n Exhibit I. \n20\n Exhibit J. \n21\n Exhibit L. \n22\n Although called a \n \n \n \n \n \n \n, for purposes of this case, none of the \n \n23\nmembers are considered experts within the meaning of Federal Rule of Evidence 702, 703, 704, 705, and 706,\nbecause Applicant has not had an opportunity in this case to cross-examine and challenge the members\u2019\nqualifications. \n Exhibit 56. \n24\n Exhibit BBB at \u00b6 15. \n25\n E.g., Exhibits 29, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, BBB, and HHH.\n26\n5\n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant executed an advisory and director\u2019s service agreement with the \ncompany on January 1, 2000.  The agreement provided that Applicant was to receive a\n20\nfee for services in the form of political advice and commercial assistance to the\ncompany. In addition, the agreement provided that Applicant would join the board of\ndirectors in exchange for an option to purchase or receive equity at favorable terms\nbefore an initial public offering of the company. During Applicant\u2019s time on the board, a\nmain interest was in the area of corporate social responsibility programs in\ninfrastructure, health, education, and cooperative business ventures for the local\nresidents. Applicant encouraged the company to provide a number of services to local\ncommunities. Applicant served as a non-executive director during the three-year period\n2000\u20132002, when Applicant resigned for personal reasons.  About five years later in\n21\n2007, it appears that the company was wound up and liquidated per court order.22\n3.\nSummary of the \n \n investigation (SOR \u00b6 4.a) \nThe \n company was one of many companies to be named in a series of\nreports issued during 2000\u20132003 by a \n \n \n \n \n \n \n.  In\n23\n2000, the \n \n was established at the request of the \n \n \n in light of the \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n.  Because the \n \n was not a judicial body, it lacked\n24\nthe power to compel testimony or production of documents, and it did \u201cnot have the\nresources to carry out an investigation whereby [the] findings can be considered as\nestablished facts.\u201d  Nevertheless, it gathered a good deal of information and issued a\n25\nseries of reports,  and then disbanded in \n \n.  \n26\n\n Exhibit 29. \n27\n Exhibit 61 at \u00b6\u00b6 9 and 12. \n28\n Exhibit HHHH at \u00b6 2. \n29\n Exhibit HH. \n30\n Exhibit HH at Reaction 26, and Exhibit GGGG at Annex 2. \n31\n Exhibit 61. \n32\n6\nThe \n \n named the \n company in Annex I\u2014in which it recommended\nthe placing of financial restrictions\u2014of its report published in \n \n.  Applicant\n27\nwas then serving as a non-executive director of the \n company and was involved in\nthe company\u2019s response to the report. Indeed, the company had a vigorous response to\nthe report. Applicant assisted the company until resigning at the end of 2002 for reasons\nunrelated to the \n \n report.  \nThe companies named in Annex I of the \n \n report (as well as the\nindividuals named in Annex II) were, according to the \n \n, involved \n \n \n in a way that could be linked, directly or indirectly, to contribute to\nfunding conflicts in a certain \n country.  The 29 companies in Annex I were also\n28\nconsidered by the \n \n to be in violation of certain guidelines for multinational\nenterprises (Guidelines), as were the 85 companies named in Annex III of the \n report. The Guidelines (a noncompulsory code of business ethics) \u201care a set of\nrecommendations adopted by governments and addressed to multinational enterprises\ngoverning their conduct.\u201d  Implementation is overseen by a National Contact Point\n29\n(NCP) for each signatory country. \nThe \n \n \n \n report created strong reactions by those named in\nit (to include the \n company) and generated media interest. As a result, the \n undertook the substantial task of having a dialogue with the named companies, to\ninclude the \n company, and published their responses or \u201creactions\u201d in a \n \nreport.  In total, 54 parties (companies and individuals) along with 4 governments filed\n30\nreactions to the \n \n report. A review of the \n company\u2019s reaction shows\nthe company had a series of meetings with the \n \n and received an assurance\nthat the company and its chairman would be removed from all the annexes to the\n \n report.    \n31\nThe \n \n, via the dialogue process, reached settlement with a number of\nthe companies and published its final report at the end of its mandate in \n \n.32\nIn this report, the \n \n divided the companies into five categories and placed the\n company into the third category for unresolved cases referred to the relevant NCP\n\n Exhibit 74 at \u00b6 2. \n33\n Exhibit 74. \n34\n Exhibit 74 at \u00b6\u00b6 18\u201320. \n35\n Exhibit 74 at \u00b6 17. \n36\n Exhibits 66, 67, 68, and 69. \n37\n Id.\n38\n Department Counsel argued that the actions of the \n and \n are \u201cnot probative of anything.\u201d Post-hearing\n39\nBrief at 26. But I suspect Department Counsel might argue just the opposite had the actions been imposed\nand not lifted by the \n and \n. In short, these are relevant surrounding circumstances. \n7\nfor updating or investigation. The \n \n placed the \n company in the unresolved\ncategory due to an ongoing \n action by the company against a \n, as the \n thought additional evidence might come to light during that case.  \n33\nThe process continued with the NCP after the libel action was settled in 2004.\nThe process concluded in 2005 without further developments. In its report or statement\non the \n company, the NCP described its efforts to facilitate and mediate a dialogue\nbetween the \n company and a non-governmental organization that was acting as a\ncomplainant in the matter.  Ultimately, the NCP concluded that an agreed settlement\n34\ncould not be reached due to a lack of good faith and a lack of a constructive dialogue\nbetween the parties.  In concluding its report, however, the NCP noted that the \n35\n had reached resolution with the \n company on the issues raised in the \n reports.     \n36\n4.\nSummary of the action by the U.S. Department of Treasury against the\n company and related actions (SOR \u00b6 4.a)\nIn \n \n, the U.S. Department of Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Asset Control\ndesignated the \n company and its former chairman, along with several other\nentities, whose support for \n \n regime contributed to the undermining of\ndemocratic processes and institutions in the country of \n.  As a result of\n37\nTreasury\u2019s action, which has not been lifted, any assets of the designated individuals\nand entities that are within U.S. jurisdiction were frozen and U.S. persons are prohibited\nfrom conducting financial or commercial transactions with them. Treasury\u2019s action\noccurred several years after Applicant resigned from the \n company, and none of\ndocuments from Treasury mention Applicant.  Nor do they mention circumstances that\n38\ntie the action to when Applicant was involved with the company.  \nTwo other governmental entities took similar actions against the \n company\nand its former chairman.  The \n \n \n issued regulations imposing\n39\nrestrictive measures on the sale of certain goods to \n and providing assistance\n\n Exhibit BBBB. \n40\n Id.\n41\n Exhibits CCCC and DDDD. \n42\n Exhibits EEEE and FFFF. \n43\n Tr. 4: 130. \n44\n8\nto \n \n \n \n.  Under that regulation, in \n \n, the \n40\ncompany and its former chairman were named as being in violation of the regulation\nand therefore subject to sanctions, to include freezing of assets.  Then in \n41\n, the \n removed the \n company and its former chairman from the list of those\nin violation because there were no longer grounds for keeping them on the list.42\nFollowing the \n, the \n \n \n took similar action against the \ncompany and its former chairman in \n, and the \n lifted those sanctions in \n.  \n43\n5.\nSummary of Applicant\u2019s involvement with other companies during 2003 to\npresent (SOR \u00b6 4.b)\nAfter resigning from the \n company, Applicant joined the board of an \ncompany that \n \n \n. The \n company was essentially a spinoff of\nthe \n company.  In this capacity, Applicant continued working with certain persons\n44\nwho were still on the board of the \n company, to include the chairman. At some\npoint, the chairman dropped off the board of the \n company and Applicant has had\nno further dealings with him. Applicant served on the board on the \n company until\nit was dissolved in about 2007. In addition, Applicant served as the non-executive chair\nof the board for another company, which the prior \n company was a 50% owner.\nApplicant has had no involvement with or connection to this company since sometime in\n2006.  \nFollowing the dissolution of the \n company in 2007, a former senior\nexecutive of the \n company obtained new employment as the CEO of a \ncompany.    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Applicant became a non-executive director of the \n company in 2007 and\ncontinues to date. The \n company works in several lines of business, and it is also a\npart-owner of other businesses. One such business is an investment company\n(company Z) doing business in \n, a country of concern to the United States\nand the international community. The \n company is a 20% shareholder of company Z\nand has a management contract with the company. The companies are separate\ncorporate entities, they are run independently, and Applicant has no role in or\ninvolvement with company Z. \n\n Exhibit U. \n45\n Exhibits V and GG. \n46\n Exhibits C, D, E, F, and G. \n47\n Tr. 2: 4\u201342; Exhibits A and V. \n48\n Tr. 2: 8\u201312; 40\u201341.\n49\n Tr. 2: 12. \n50\n9\n6.\nSummary of Applicant\u2019s good character evidence  \nApplicant has a long history of dedication to the interests of the United States.\nConsistent with this fact, Applicant presented a wealth of good character evidence. A\nretired ambassador  and two retired high-ranking military officers  appeared as\n45\n46\nwitnesses and they vouched for Applicant\u2019s security suitability and trustworthiness. In\naddition, the documentary evidence includes letters from five individuals who did not\nappear as witnesses.  The authors of the letters are (1) a retired vice admiral (Navy),\n47\n(2) a retired admiral (Navy), (3) a retired four-star general (Army), (4) a retired four-star\ngeneral (Marine Corps), and (5) the president of the \n organization that employs\nApplicant. They are uniform in their praise of Applicant\u2019s past accomplishments and\nservice to the United States. They also have a highly favorable assessment of\nApplicant\u2019s security suitability and trustworthiness.  \nMost impressive was the testimony of a retired four-star general (Air Force).  He\n48\nserved at the highest levels of the military establishment, in positions subject to Senate\nconfirmation, and by implication he had the trust and confidence of the Secretary of\nDefense and the President. In his testimony, he told a story in which he described\nApplicant\u2019s role in an overseas military operation to illustrate his trust and confidence in\nApplicant.  The point of the story was to show that Applicant \u201cwas one of the few\n49\npeople that was trusted with this kind of very, very sensitive information to carry out the\ndirection of the President of the United States as we carried out this attack.\u201d50\nLaw and Policies\nThis section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an\nindustrial security clearance case. The only purpose of a clearance decision is to decide\nif an applicant is suitable for access to classified information. The Department of\nDefense takes the handling and safeguarding of classified information seriously\nbecause it affects our national security, the lives of servicemembers, and our operations\nabroad. \n\n Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \u2018right\u2019 to\n51\na security clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10  Cir. 2002) (no right to a\nth\nsecurity clearance).\n 484 U.S. at 531.\n52\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n53\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n54\n ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004).\n55\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n56\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n57\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n58\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n59\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n60\n10\nA security clearance is a privilege, as it is well-established law that no one has a\nright to a security clearance.  As  noted by the Supreme Court in Department of Navy\n51\nv. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance\ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  Under Egan, Executive\n52\nOrder 10865, and the Directive, any doubt about whether an applicant should be\nallowed access to classified information will be resolved in favor of protecting national\nsecurity.  \nA favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted\na security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.  An\n53\nunfavorable decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing security\nclearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.  \n54\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for\naccess to classified information.  The Government has the burden of presenting\n55\nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An\n56\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nfacts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate\n57\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme\n58\nCourt stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.59\nThe DOHA Appeal Board has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of\nfact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.60\nThe AG set forth the relevant standards to consider when evaluating a person\u2019s\nsecurity clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions\nfor each guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a commonsense\n\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n61\n AG \u00b6\u00b6 33, 34, and 35 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating conditions). \n62\n AG \u00b6 33. \n63\n Although not alleged in the SOR, I considered the additional security infractions that took place during\n64\n1985\u20131997 to evaluate the evidence in mitigation and the extent to which Applicant demonstrated reform and\nrehabilitation. See ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) (describing five examples when\nit is proper to consider conduct not alleged in an SOR) (citations omitted). \n11\ndecision based upon consideration of all the relevant and material information, the\npertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-person concept. \nThe Government must be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in\nthose persons to whom it grants access to classified information. The decision to deny a\nperson a security clearance is not a determination of an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it\n61\nis a determination that an applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has\nestablished for granting eligibility for access.\nAnalysis\nThe first issue is does Applicant\u2019s past record of security infractions disqualify\nher from having continuing access to classified information. Under Guideline K for\nhandling protected information,  the suitability of an applicant may be questioned or put\n62\ninto doubt when that applicant has a history of noncompliance with security rules and\nregulations. The overall concern under Guideline K is that:\nDeliberate or negligent failure to comply with rules and regulations for\nprotecting classified or other sensitive information raises doubt about an\nindividual\u2019s trustworthiness, judgment, reliability, or willingness to\nsafeguard such information, and is a serious security concern.  \n63\nThe evidence here supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of\nnoncompliance with security rules and regulations. Applicant\u2019s record of multiple\nsecurity infractions over a period of years is ample proof of this conclusion.  It is most\n64\nprobable that Applicant committed the infractions due to a combination of factors, such\nas the press of business in a demanding work environment as well as lax, careless, or\ninattentive security practices. Of particular concern is the repeated nature of the\ninfractions despite warnings and briefings by security officials. This shows Applicant was\ninattentive, did not exercise due care, or had a lax attitude when it came to proper\nhandling and safeguarding classified information. These facts and circumstances\nrequire consideration of the following Guideline K disqualifying conditions:\n34(g) Any failure to comply with rules for the protection of classified or\nother sensitive information; and \n\n Fed. R. Evid. 609(b)(2) (describing the ten-year time limit and circumstances where the evidence of\n65\nconviction older than ten years is admissible ).\n12\n34(h) Negligence or lax security habits that persist despite counseling by\nmanagement. \nThe guideline also contains conditions that may mitigate security concerns. The\nthree conditions are described as follows:\n35(a) So much time has elapsed since the behavior, or it has happened so\ninfrequently or under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to\nrecur and does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;\n35(b) The individual responded favorably to counseling or remedial\nsecurity training and now demonstrates a positive attitude toward the\ndischarge of security responsibilities; and\n35(c) The security violations were due to improper or inadequate training.\nOf those mitigating conditions, the most pertinent here is subparagraph 35(a).\nApplicant\u2019s security infractions took place years ago. The four security infractions\nalleged in the SOR, which are the most recent, took place in 1998, more than ten years\nago. Crossing the ten-year mark is significant because it is a commonsense\nmeasurement of recency or remoteness. This is recognized in the law as well. For\nexample, the law of evidence prohibits interrogation of witnesses about remote criminal\nconvictions by imposing a ten-year time limit.  \n65\nNevertheless, Applicant\u2019s record of lax or sloppy habits in the handling of\nclassified information should be considered along with any record of recent proper\nhandling of classified information. Applicant has had access to classified information\nsince retiring from the government, but has not had occasion to physically handle\nclassified information. In other words, Applicant has passively received classified\ninformation during briefings and meetings, but has not actively handled classified\ninformation. This means Applicant has not had an opportunity to demonstrate that the\nlax or sloppy security habits of the past will not recur. Looking forward, without\nsubstantial evidence of change or reform of Applicant\u2019s security habits, it is reasonable\nto expect Applicant\u2019s future to be more like the past, which is a record of repeated\nsecurity infractions despite repeated cautions to the contrary. \nThe passage of time since 1998 without additional security infractions does not,\nunder the particular facts here, demonstrate changed circumstances or conduct\nsufficient to justify a conclusion of reform and rehabilitation that would mitigate the\nsecurity concerns. I reach this conclusion after a thorough review of the record and\nconsiderable thought, bearing in mind Applicant\u2019s well-established record of exceptional\n\n AG \u00b6\u00b6 15, 16, and 17 (setting forth the security concerns and the disqualifying and mitigating conditions).\n66\n AG \u00b6 15. \n67\n13\nservice to the United States as well as the Appeal Board\u2019s rather strict caselaw under\nGuideline K.  \nThe issue under Guideline E for personal conduct consists of two related parts.\nThe first part, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 4.a, is does Applicant\u2019s involvement as a non-\nexecutive director of the \n company demonstrate such questionable judgment that it\nshould disqualify Applicant from access to classified information. The second part, as\nalleged in SOR \u00b6 4.b, is does Applicant\u2019s continued business relationships with certain\npersons with whom Applicant associated with when involved with the \n company\ndemonstrate such questionable judgement that it should disqualify Applicant from\naccess to classified information.\nUnder Guideline E for personal conduct,  the suitability of an applicant may be\n66\nquestioned or put into doubt due to false statements and credible adverse information\nthat may not be enough to support action under any other guideline. The overall\nconcern under Guideline E is that:  \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations [that may] raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide\ntruthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any\nother failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \n67\nIn assessing the evidence, I have considered the following disqualifying\nconditions under the guideline:\n16(c) Credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that\nis not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single\nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness,\nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and\nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not\nproperly safeguard protected information; and \n16(d) Credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any\nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse\ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information\nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment,\nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply\nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the\n\n Exhibits 66, 67, 68, and 69. \n68\n14\nperson may not properly safeguard protected information. This includes\nbut is not limited to consideration of:\n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of\nclient confidentiality, release of proprietary information,\nunauthorized release of sensitive corporate or other\ngovernment protected information:\n(2) disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior in the\nworkplace; \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and\n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other\nemployer's time or resources.\nI have also considered all the mitigating circumstances under the guideline.\nHaving considered the evidence as a whole as well as the oral arguments and\nwritten briefs of the parties, the Guideline E matters are decided for Applicant. In short, I\nam not persuaded by the evidence that Applicant\u2019s involvement, past and current,\nserving on these particular corporate boards demonstrates such questionable judgment\nthat it should disqualify Applicant from access to classified information. \nConcerning SOR \u00b6 4.a, the most concerning item is the Treasury Department\u2019s\naction \n \n, when it imposed sanctions against the \n company and its former\nchairman. Those sanctions are still in effect, and I would likely decide this aspect of the\ncase against Applicant if the evidence had tied Treasury\u2019s action to Applicant\u2019s\ninvolvement with the \n company during \n. But the evidence on this point\nis not persuasive.  Indeed, the evidence shows Treasury took the action  \n, years\n68\nafter Applicant resigned from the \n company, and Applicant has not associated with\nthe company\u2019s former chairman for several years as well. Accordingly, the Treasury\nDepartment\u2019s action is too disconnected or far removed to attribute to Applicant. \nThe other matters in SOR \u00b6 4.a are not a concern for the following reasons. First,\nI am not persuaded that the series of reports by the \n \n, when read together,\ndemonstrate that the \n company did anything wrong. Indeed, the \n \nreport and the follow-on action by the NCP suggest that the matters of concern were\nresolved in the company\u2019s favor. In assessing the reports, they should be viewed with a\nbit of healthy skepticism because the \n \n was not a judicial body whereby its\nfindings can be accepted as established facts. Further skepticism may be justified\nbecause the \n \n was a creation of the \n \n, an entity where politics and\npolitical agendas may come into play. Second, I am not persuaded that Applicant did\nanything wrong or unethical \n \n \n as a non-executive director of the \n\n AG \u00b6 2(a)(1) \u2013 (9).\n69\n15\ncompany. Applicant lacked executive authority as a non-executive director and had a\nlimited role on the board. On balance, Applicant appears to have acted like a\nreasonable person would have in the same or similar situation. Third, Applicant has had\nno involvement with the company since the end of 2002, and it would be misguided and\ncontrary to common sense to hold Applicant accountable for the activities of the\ncompany during 2003 and beyond.  \nTurning to SOR \u00b6 4.b, it is wholly appropriate to judge an applicant\u2019s security\nsuitability by looking at those individuals or entities with whom an applicant voluntarily\nchooses to associate. With that said, I am not persuaded by the evidence that\nApplicant\u2019s past or current association with former members of the \n company\ndemonstrate questionable judgment under Guideline E. Applicant has not associated\nwith the former chairman in several years and has no intention to do so. Applicant\u2019s\ncurrent association with the CEO of the \n company is not illegal or unreasonable.\nApplicant has no involvement with company Z and its commercial activities in\n. Indeed, the \n company and company Z are separate corporate entities\nthat operate independently. Accordingly, it would be misguided and contrary to common\nsense to hold Applicant accountable for the activities of a company in which Applicant\nhas no role or involvement. Moreover, based on the evidence, I am persuaded that this\nApplicant, who has a record of exceptional service to the United States, would not be\nassociated with the \n regime in any way. \nTo conclude, following Egan and the clearly-consistent standard, Applicant\u2019s\nrecord of multiple security infractions creates doubts or concerns about Applicant\u2019s\nfitness or suitability for a security clearance. In reaching this conclusion, I gave due\nconsideration to Applicant\u2019s case in light of the whole-person concept,  and the credit\n69\ndue Applicant is not enough to overcome the security concerns. In doing so, I gave\nsubstantial weight to Applicant\u2019s exceptional career on behalf of the United States, for\nwhich I have great respect. And I gave substantial weight to the highly favorable\nevidence of Applicant\u2019s good character and trustworthiness. Indeed, some of this\nevidence was quite powerful. Nevertheless, Applicant did not meet the ultimate burden\nof persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. This case is decided against\nApplicant. \nFormal Findings\nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations are as follows:\nParagraph 1, Guideline L:\nWithdrawn \nAll Subparagraphs:\nWithdrawn\nParagraph 2, Guideline B:\nWithdrawn\nAll Subparagraphs:\nWithdrawn\n\n16\nParagraph 3, Guideline K:\nAgainst Applicant\nAll Subparagraphs:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 4, Guideline E:\nFor Applicant\nAll Subparagraphs:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

Whether the Record Supports the Administrative Judge\u2019s Factual Findings\n \nA.  Facts\nThe Judge made the following findings:  Applicant has a history of financial difficulties\ndating back to the early 1990s.  Although Applicant\u2019s financial problems were exacerbated by his\ndivorce, they predated that event.  By March 2005, Applicant \u201chad still not resolved [his] debts.  In\nsome instances, he had not yet been in contact with the creditors.  In others, he claimed to have been\nin contact as long ago as August 2003, but did not follow up on his original contacts when the\ncreditors did not respond.\u201d  \nApplicant had paid some of the debts listed in the SOR and provided evidence that he was\nattempting to settle some of the debts.  However, Applicant\u2019s claims that he was in active negotiation\nwith creditors were not corroborated.  After the hearing, Applicant did demonstrate that he had\nentered into settlement agreements with some of the creditors listed in the SOR.  \u201cApplicant testified\nthat he had no budget and had undertaken no financial counseling.  He claimed to have about $600\nper month positive cash flow with which to address his debts.\u201d  \nB.  Discussion\nThe Appeal Board\u2019s review of the Administrative Judge\u2019s finding of facts is limited to\ndetermining if they are supported by substantial evidence\u2014such relevant evidence as a reasonable\nmind might accept as adequate to support such a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in\nthe record.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1. \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the\npossibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an\nadministrative agency\u2019s finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Consolo v.

In evaluating\nthe Administrative Judge\u2019s finding, we are required to give deference to the Administrative Judge\u2019s\ncredibility determinations.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.

The Appeal Board may reverse the Administrative Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or\nrevoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.3.\nOur scope of review under this standard is narrow and we may not substitute our judgment for that\nof the Administrative Judge. We review matters of law de novo.\nIn this case, the Judge found that Applicant had a lengthy history of not meeting financial\nobligations.  At the time the case was submitted for decision, Applicant still had unpaid debts and\nhad only recently taken action to resolve his financial problems.  In light of the foregoing, the Judge\nreasonably concluded that Applicant\u2019s financial problems were still ongoing.  See ISCR Case No.\n03-26213 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 23, 2006).  The Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by\nApplicant against the length and seriousness of the disqualifying conduct, and considered the\npossible application of relevant mitigating conditions.  The Judge found in favor of Applicant with\nrespect to some of the SOR allegations.  However, the Judge reasonably explained why the evidence\nwhich Applicant had presented in mitigation was insufficient to overcome the government\u2019s security\nconcerns.  The Board does not review a case de novo.  The favorable record evidence cited by\nApplicant is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary\nto law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-28041 at 4 (App. Bd. June 29, 2005).  A Judge is not required\nto discuss each and every piece of record evidence.  See ISCR Case No. 02-29608 at 4 (App. Bd.\nDec. 17, 2003).  Given the record that was before him, the Judge\u2019s ultimate unfavorable clearance\ndecision under Guideline F is sustainable.

Otherwise his brief does not make an\nallegation of harmful error.1\nThe Judge made the following findings: Applicant, a 51 year old married employee of a\ndefense contractor, was arrested in October 1996 for speeding and possession of marijuana.  In 1998\nhe pled guilty to the marijuana charge and was placed on probation, with a deferred judgement.\nLater, while still on probation, he smoked marijuana during a vacation to Florida.  Upon his return,\nhis probation officer directed Applicant to submit to a drug test, which yielded a positive result for\nmarijuana.  As a consequence, his probation was extended and he was required to submit to monthly\ndrug tests.  He subsequently failed one of these tests, which yielded a positive result for marijuana.\nIn addition to these incidents, Applicant used marijuana from 1992 to 1999, beginning on a\nweekly basis but increasing his usage to several times a week.  Applicant no longer associates with\nhis drug using companions.  \nOn April 3, 2002, Applicant completed his security clearance application.  He answered \u201cno\u201d\nto question 24, which inquired if he had ever been charged or convicted of an offense related to\nalcohol or drugs.  Applicant stated that, since the charges in his marijuana possession case were\ndismissed in 2000, he had a clean record and believed he could truthfully answer the question in the\nnegative.  Additionally, he answered \u201cno\u201d to question 27, which inquired if he had illegally used any\ncontrolled substance during the previous 7 years.  Applicant admitted that he was afraid that a\ntruthful answer to this question would affect his employment.  \nThe application of  disqualifying or mitigating conditions requires the exercise of sound\ndiscretion in light of the record evidence as a whole.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-14740 at 7 (App.\nBd. Jan. 15, 2003). As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide\nwhether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  A party\u2019s\ndisagreement with the Judge's weighing of the record evidence is not sufficient to demonstrate the\nJudge weighed the evidence in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See ISCR\nCase No. 05-00609 at 2-3 (App. Bd.

ABLARD\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nNichole Noel, Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant failed to mitigate personal conduct security concerns arising from deliberate\nfailure to list on his 2003 SF 86 at Question 26 three criminal charges occurring between 2000 and\n2002. He also failed to report at Question 40 his application for a restraining order filed by him\nagainst his wife in 2003. He attributed the omissions to advice given to him by his corporate security\nstaff to omit the information, but to report it to an investigator when he was interviewed. However,\nwhen he was interviewed by two investigators, he reported the information to the first but only after\nbeing asked about it, and told the second one that he had reported the information on his SF 86. He\nmitigated criminal conduct security concerns arising from the same incidents he failed to reveal\nbecause of the passage of time and no further incidents since 2002. Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF CASE\nOn March 14, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\n\n2\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, as amended and\nmodified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the\npreliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. DOHA recommended the case be\nreferred to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued,\ndenied, or revoked.\nOn April 14, 2007, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and requested a hearing. The\nmatter was assigned to me on July 12, 2007. A notice of hearing was issued on July 19, 2007, for\na hearing on August 7, 2007, and held that day. The government offered five exhibits and Applicant\noffered ten at the hearing. All were admitted into evidence. One witness and Applicant testified for\nApplicant. The transcript was received on August 20, 2007. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted one allegation (SOR \u00b6 1.a.1.) under Guideline E relating to failure to\ndisclose three arrests on his Application for Security Clearance (SF 86) dated August 23, 2003. He\ndenied all other allegations under Guidelines E and J with explanatory information. After a complete\nreview of the record, I make the following findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 33-year-old employee of a major defense contractor. He works as a computer\nsystems administrator. He served on active duty with the Air Force for nine years and has worked\nfor his present employer in two different positions since April 2001. He is highly regarded for his\nwork performance in statements and evaluations (Exhs. B, C, and E-J). \nDuring a 22-month period between May 2000 and March 2002, Applicant had the three\ninstances of criminal behavior to which he admitted as follows: \n1. Arrested in May 2000 and charged with Harassment-Strike, Shove, Kick relating to a\ndispute with his then girlfriend, to whom he is now married. He removed her from the home he was\nthen occupying with his former wife. He plead guilty to the charge and received a deferred sentence\nof 24 months probation with fines and costs. He was ordered to complete 36 weeks of a domestic\nviolence course. In 2001 a warrant for arrest was issued for failure to comply; he was arrested and\ncompleted the terms of the sentence in May 2002 (Exh. 4). He was represented by counsel who\nadvised that the failure to comply issue would be taken care of but it was not (Exh. H). \n2. During the time he was on probation for the above charge, he was arrested for Prostitution\n(Solicitation) arising from a discussion with an undercover female police officer who approached\nhis vehicle and mentioned having sex with him. He called her a \u201cbitch\u201d and drove off. A mile or so\naway he was stopped by another police officer who confronted him about the matter including the\nlanguage used, and gave him a ticket. On the advice of counsel, he plead guilty and received a fine\nalthough he continues to deny the charge and believes the real reason he was ticketed was because\nof the language he directed to the undercover officer. \n\n3\n3. The third criminal charge was for Fighting on March 31, 2002 and concerned a dispute\nwith a woman friend of his wife\u2019s who confronted him about his retrieval of a coat belonging to\nApplicant from the friend\u2019s husband. He received a ticket and the charge was dismissed.\nWhen Applicant submitted his SF 86 he failed to list any of the above in response to\nQuestion 26: Your Police Record-Other Offenses. The only criminal conduct to which he admitted\nwas at Question 25 relating to Military Courts on the SF 86. This was a 2000 Article 15 punishment\nof a reduction in rank for failure to attend a meeting when he was leaving the Air Force. He\nattributed the Article 15 to an overly aggressive supervisor. \nApplicant also failed to report in response to Question 40: Public Record Civil Court Actions\na complaint he filed for a temporary restraining order against his present wife on August 1, 2003.\nThe court found sufficient cause existed for issuance of the order but he asked that it not be enforced\nagainst her and it was not (Exh. 5). \nApplicant contended that he failed to list the required information on his SF 86 because he\nwas under time pressure to complete the application as he was transferring to a new job and his\nsecurity clearance (Top Secret) had expired. However, the evidence produced at the hearing\nindicated that he had been in the new job for six months before the SF 86 was completed. Despite\nthe supposed time pressure, he gave quite detailed answers to other questions, including information\nrelating to his formal education. He stated that the corporate security staff was aware of his lack of\ndetailed information about the criminal charges and told him to wait for the interview to divulge it.\nHe was supported in this belief by a statement from one member of the security staff who verified\nApplicant\u2019s statement but through hearsay from another officer who was no longer employed (Exh.\nK). The government objected to the admission of the statement as hearsay. I admit it for whatever\nprobative value it may have. While not totally reliable, it does offer some support to his statement\nof justification for omitting the information from his SF 86. He testified that he saw an investigator\nwithin a few days of filing his SF 86 and revealed all to him, but no evidence was offered to support\nhis contention.\nTwo statements from Applicant based on investigative interviews were introduced in the\nrecord. The first was given on January 26, 2004, six months after the SF 86 was filed. The second\nwas on August 23, 2005, two years later. In the first interview, he discussed the first two criminal\nallegations but not the third one. He denied being guilty of the first two and stated erroneously that\nthe prostitution charge was dismissed whereas, in fact, he plead guilty and was fined (Exh. 2). In his\nsecond interview he inexplicably stated to the investigator that he had given information about the\ncriminal charges on his SF 86 (Exh. 3). \nEven if I were to fully accept Applicant\u2019s account of the discussions with his security staff,\nthe information revealed in the first interview was only given after the investigator asked if there\nwere omissions in the SF 86. This does not comply with the Guideline E mitigating condition\nrequirement that the information must be submitted on the initiative of the applicant and not after\nbeing questioned about it. Also, his actions do not comply with the instructions he says he received\nfrom his security staff. Instead, the interview reports indicate a number of partial and half-truths\nmade to the investigators. Thus, rather than mitigating the problems created by the omissions on his\nSF 86, he compounded them by his subsequent failure to come forth immediately and volunteer\ncomplete information to an investigator. \n\n4\nApplicant holds two associate degrees, a bachelor\u2019s degree, and two master\u2019s degrees in his\nfield. He has held security clearances for 13 years based on two clearances while in the Air Force.\nThe SF 86 in question here was the third he had filed in his career. He is well regarded for his work.\nHowever, his lack of full and complete responses to both the requirements of the clearance\napplication and his responsibility to respond accurately in his interviews indicates a casualness with\nhis obligation to tell the truth and give full and candid answers. He tends to minimize his own\nconduct and blame others for the issues presented in this matter. \nApplicant is marred to his second wife. He has two children, ages 15 and 16. The older child\nis from his first marriage, and he shares custody. The second is his step child living at home. His\nwife is employed in the medical field and they have a joint income of $125,000 per annum. \nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position that will give that person access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527.\nAn evaluation of whether the applicant meets the security guidelines includes consideration\nof the following factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and\nmaturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence\nof rehabilitation and other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential\nfor pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nDirective, \u00b6 E2.2.1. Security clearances are granted only when \u201cit is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to do so.\u201d Executive Order No. 10865 \u00a7 2. See Executive Order No. 12968 \u00a7 3.1(b).\nInitially, the government must establish, by something less than a preponderance of the\nevidence, that conditions exist in the personal or professional history of the applicant which\ndisqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.\nSee Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. The applicant then bears the burden of demonstrating that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance. \u201cAny doubt as to\nwhether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved\nin favor of the national security.\u201d Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.2. \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should\nerr, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. See Executive Order No. 12968 \u00a7\n3.1(b).\nCONCLUSIONS\nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate\nadjudicative factors, I conclude the following with respect to all allegations set forth in the SOR:\nApplicant\u2019s failure to report three arrests and charges at Question 26 of his SF 86, and the\n\n5\napplication for a restraining order at Question 40, as well as failure to fully inform investigators of\naccurate details of the issues, prompted security concerns under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of\nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective September 1, 2006. Such conduct might indicate\nquestionable judgment, unreliability, and unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations and\ncould indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information (AG 15).\nSpecifically, conditions that could raise a security concern and be disqualifying include the deliberate\nomission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security\nquestionnaire (AG 16 a). The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and\nmaterial facts in a personnel security interview could raise a security concern and be disqualifying\n(AG 16 b). \nThere are several mitigating conditions in Guideline E, but none are applicable. In view of\nthe detail of other answers he gave on the SF 86 to other questions such as his education, is difficult\nto explain. Thus, I conclude against Applicant as to the three specific allegations under SOR \u00b6 1.a.\nAs to the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.b. relating to the failure to report the restraining order at Question\n40 concerning Public Record Civil Court Actions I find his reason for not reporting it to be not\ncredible since he was the initiator of the action. I rule against him. As to the misstatements in the\nreports of the two investigators in 2004 and 2005, the differences in the detail given to the two\ninvestigators as stated in their reports shows a lack of attention to detail to the point of justifying a\nfinding that it was deliberate. I find against him as to that allegation. \nI conclude in favor of Applicant as to the omission of the Fighting charge in 2002 since it was\ndismissed and Applicant reasonably believed that it did not need to be reported since he was only\nticketed and not formally arrested. As to the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.d. I conclude against Applicant\nas to the statement that the Prostitution (Solicitation) charge was dismissed since he clearly knew\nthat he had a plead guilty to the charge. As to SOR \u00b6 1.e., I conclude against Applicant regarding the\nstatement to the second investigator that he had included the three criminal charges on his SF 86\nsince he has consistently admitted that he omitted them but for reasons attributable to his corporate\nsecurity staff. \nAlso alleged is security concern under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) relating to the three\ncivilian criminal arrests in 2000, 2001, and 2002 as well as the Article 15 in 2000 since criminal\nactivity creates doubt about judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into\nquestion a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. Also alleged\nis a criminal violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 regarding the allegations in SOR \u00b6 1 relating to the\nomission of the three criminal charges and inconsistency in information provided to the two\ninvestigators. Such conduct might create doubts about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness. It calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and\nregulations (AG 30). Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include\nan allegation or admission of criminal conduct (AG 31 c).\nMitigating conditions (MC) might apply if so much time has elapsed since the criminal\nbehavior happened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and\ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgement (AG 32 a).\nAnother MC provides mitigation if there is evidence of successful rehabilitation without recurrence\nof criminal activity, remorse, and a good employment record. \n\n6\nSince the specific criminal conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6 1. occurred five to seven years ago\nunder circumstances unlikely to recur I conclude that both mitigating conditions are applicable. As\nto the allegation in SOR \u00b6 2.c. relating to 18 U.S.C. 1001, I conclude that the evidence produced\nregarding SOR \u00b6 1 rises to level required for establishing criminal conduct since the omissions were\ndeliberate and were not mitigated by subsequent conduct with the investigators.\nIn all adjudications the protection of our national security is of paramount concern. Persons\nwho have access to classified information have an overriding responsibility for the security concerns\nof the nation. The objective of the security clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense\nassessment of a person\u2019s trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information. The \u201cwhole\nperson\u201d concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of his acts and omissions. Each\ncase must be judged on its own merits taking into consideration all relevant circumstances, applying\nsound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis. Applicant is a young man who, at age 33, has\nbeen employed in a stable and productive position for six years. The three acts of criminal behavior\nappear to be isolated events, each caused by different factors, and not a pattern of criminal conduct.\nHowever, the failure to report them on his SF 86 for reasons not fully established and the failure to\ntell straightforward stories to two official investigators precludes favorable application of the whole\nperson test.\nAfter considering all the evidence in its totality, including the whole person of Applicant, I\nconclude that a security clearance should not be granted.\nFORMAL FINDINGS \nFormal findings as required by the Directive (Par. E3.1.25) are as follows:\nParagraph 1. Guideline E: AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.: Against Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.: Against Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.: For Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.: Against Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.: Against Applicant\nParagraph 2.

Newman, Esq.\n\n2\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance. On September 30, 2005, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant\nof the basis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption),\nGuideline J (Criminal Conduct) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct), pursuant to Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.\nOn June 20, 2006, after hearing, Administrative Judge LeRoy F. Foreman, granted Applicant\u2019s\nrequest.  Department Counsel submitted a timely appeal pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and\nE3.1.30.\nDepartment Counsel raised the following issues on appeal: (a) whether the Administrative\nJudge\u2019s decision concerning Guideline G was arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law in that it was\nbased on factual findings unsupported by record evidence and in that it was based upon a piecemeal\nanalysis of Applicant\u2019s four alcohol related offenses; (b) whether the Administrative Judge\u2019s\ndecision concerning Guideline J was arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law in that it was based\non factual findings unsupported by record evidence and in that it was based upon a piecemeal\nanalysis of the record; (c) whether the Administrative Judge\u2019s decision concerning Guideline E was\narbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law due to his exclusion of relevant and material evidence\ncontained in  Government Exhibit 3; and (d) whether the Administrative Judge\u2019s decision was\narbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law in that he resolved a \u201cclose case\u201d in favor of Applicant and\nagainst the interests of national security. \nWhether the Record Supports the Administrative Judge\u2019s Factual Findings\n \nA.  Facts\nThe Administrative Judge made the following relevant findings of facts:\nApplicant began consuming alcohol in college, becoming intoxicated about twice a year at\nparties.  In December 1987, while on active duty with the U.S. Army, Applicant was apprehended\nfor the offense of Driving While Impaired.  The incident occurred after he had celebrated the\nsuccessful completion of an exercise with his troops.  Applicant\u2019s commander imposed punishment\nunder Article 15, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C.  \u00a7  815.  The punishment consisted of forfeiture of $500 pay per\nmonth for two months.  Additionally, his on-post driving privileges were suspended for one year.\nLater that month, Applicant was apprehended for driving in violation of the suspension order\nand for having an open container of alcohol in his car.  His commander administered an oral\nreprimand to him.\nIn April 1990, Applicant\u2019s security clearance was revoked, but it was restored in May 1991.\nIn 1996 he was offered a sensitive position after submitting to a \u201cfull lifestyle and counterintelligence\ninvestigation and receiving a security clearance.\u201d  \nOn July 28, 2000, Applicant was arrested for DWI by civilian authorities.  He pled \u201cnolo\ncontendere\u201d and was sentenced to 150 days in jail (suspended), a $500 fine, and 18 months\nprobation.  On January 2, 2003, Applicant joined some friends at a club, where, he testified, he\nconsumed one beer.  Leaving the club, Applicant was stopped for speeding.  Applicant had a .06\nresult on the breathalyser and submitted to a field sobriety test, which was not videotaped.  Civilian\n\n\u201cConditions that could mitigate security concerns include . . . acquittal . . .\u201d (Directive \u00b6 E2.A10.1.3.5). \n1\n3\nauthorities charged him with DWI (second offense) based on the arresting officer\u2019s observations of\nApplicant\u2019s bloodshot eyes, slurred speech, the smell of alcohol on the breath, unsteady balance and\neye movements.  Applicant was convicted after a jury trial and sentenced to 30 days in jail and a\n$1,500 fine.\nThe Administrative Judge found that, after serving his time in jail, Applicant requested a new\ntrial, which was granted, for reasons not evident from the file.  Prosecutors dismissed the DWI\ncharge and refiled the case on a charge of obstructing a passageway (he was in the drive through lane\nof a fast food restaurant when the police stopped him).  Applicant was sentenced to 3 days in jail,\na $2,000 fine, 24 months of probation, and 24 hours of community service.  In the Conclusions\nsection of his decision, the Judge stated the following: \u201cAn acquittal is a mitigating condition...under\n[Guideline J].  Applicant was not acquitted of DWI after his July [sic] 2003 arrest, but I consider the\njudge\u2019s decision granting a new trial and dismissing the charge as sufficiently close to an acquittal\nto constitute a mitigating condition.\u201d\nWhen Applicant filled out his SF 86, which asked in question 24 if he had ever been charged\nor convicted of any offense related to alcohol or drugs, he disclosed the July 2000 arrest but did not\ndisclose the two military offenses from 1987.  Applicant stated that he believed that military offenses\nwere covered by question 25, which inquired about military disciplinary proceedings.  \nB.  Discussion\nThe Appeal Board\u2019s review of the Administrative Judge\u2019s finding of facts is limited to\ndetermining if they are supported by substantial evidence\u2014such relevant evidence as a reasonable\nmind might accept as adequate to support such a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in\nthe record.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1. \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the\npossibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an\nadministrative agency\u2019s finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Consolo v. Federal\nMaritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620-21, 86 S. Ct. 1018, 16 L. Ed. 2d 131 (1966)). In evaluating\nthe Administrative Judge\u2019s finding, we are required to give deference to the Administrative Judge\u2019s\ncredibility determinations. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s statement of the issues on appeal include challenges to the sufficiency\nof the Judge\u2019s factual findings.  One dispute is a particularly significant mixed question of law and\nfact.  Department Counsel disagrees with the Judge having concluded that the new trial and\nsubsequent dismissal of the 2003 DWI were the functional equivalent of an acquittal.  Department\nCounsel points out that the Directive  makes no explicit provision \u201cfor approximations or\n1\nsimilarities\u201d of an \u201cacquittal.\u201d The Department Counsel identifies the Judge\u2019s finding that this was\n\u201csufficiently close to an acquittal to constitute a mitigating condition\u201d to be a factual error.\nIn this regard, we have examined the record evidence and take note of three documents.\nGovernment Exhibit 9,  the motion for a new trial, includes the following: \u201cDefendant...moves this\nJudge to grant a new trial for the reason that the verdict is contrary to the law and evidence.\u201d  The\nbottom of the exhibit reflects that the Judge granted the motion.  Government Exhibit 10 is a\npleading submitted by the District Attorney requesting the Judge to dismiss the DWI, in light of\n\n4\nApplicant having pled guilty to obstructing a passageway.  Government Exhibit 11 contains the\ndisposition of the Obstruction charge, with the imposition of the sentence as described above.  These\ndocuments, taken together, appear to constitute a final disposition of the July 2003 DWI.  Because\nthe significance of these events involves the issue of whether, in totality, they constitute an\n\u201cacquittal\u201d for purposes of mitigation, the Board defers discussion until our discussion of whether\nthe Judge\u2019s conclusions with regard to mitigation were arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law. \nWhether the Record Supports the Administrative Judge\u2019s Ultimate Conclusions.\nAn Administrative Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a\nsatisfactory explanation for\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found\nand the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins.\nCo., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983) (quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156,\n168 (1962)). The Appeal Board may reverse the Administrative Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or\nrevoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.3. Our\nscope of review under this standard is narrow and we may not substitute our judgment for that of the\nAdministrative Judge. We may not set aside an Administrative Judge\u2019s decision \u201cthat is rational,\nbased on consideration of the relevant factors, and within the scope of the authority delegated to the\nagency ...\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n, 463 U.S. at 42. We review matters of law de novo.\nDepartment Counsel has challenged the Judge\u2019s decision on a variety of grounds, including\nthat he did not properly analyze the evidence as a whole and that he improperly excluded relevant\nand material evidence submitted by the Government.   Concerning Guideline E,  Applicant is alleged\nto have made a false statement when, in answering question 24, he did not mention his military\noffenses.  This question asks, in pertinent part, whether Applicant had \u201cever been charged with or\nconvicted of any offense(s) related to alcohol or drugs?\u201d  Applicant testified that he believed that\nmilitary matters were covered by question 25 rather than 24.  The Judge found Applicant\u2019s\nexplanation to be plausible, and the Board sees no error in that finding.  Neither punishment under\nArticle 15, UCMJ, nor a reprimand, which are the apparent extent of Applicant\u2019s military\ndisciplinary record, constitute convictions under military law.  See, for example, 10 U.S.C. \u00b6  815.\nA reasonable person, reading questions 24 and 25 in tandem, could well believe that 24 was\nconcerned exclusively with judicial dispositions of cases and that 25 was seeking information about\nthe broader spectrum of military adverse actions, which include judicial, nonjudicial, and\nadministrative actions.  \nRegarding the Administrative Judge\u2019s application of disqualifying or mitigating conditions,\nthe standard is whether he exercised sound discretion in light of the record evidence as a whole.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 01-14740 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 15, 2003).  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to\nweigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable\nevidence, or vice versa.  A party\u2019s disagreement with the Judge's weighing of the record evidence\nis not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-00609 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Nov 24, 2006).\nWhen the rulings or conclusions of an Administrative Judge are challenged, the Board must\nconsider whether they are: (1) arbitrary or capricious, or (2) contrary to law.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.3.\nIn deciding whether the Judge\u2019s rulings and conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, the Board will\nreview the Judge\u2019s decision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to\n\n\u201cAlcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence, fighting, child or spouse\n2\nabuse, or other criminal incidents related to alcohol use\u201d (Directive \u00b6 E2.A7.1.2.1). \n\u201cHabitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment\u201d (Directive \u00b6 E2.A7.1.2.5). \n3\nThe Judge\u2019s reference in the Conclusions portion of his Decision at 6 to the \u201cJuly 2003 incident\u201d instead of\n4\na January 2003 incident and his reference to Applicant\u2019s excessive alcohol consumption ending  in \u201cJanuary 2000\"\ninstead of July 2000, conflict with his findings of fact in the Decision at 3-4.  In the overall context, these errors appear\nto be harmless.  \n5\narticulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between the\nfacts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of\njudgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision\nthat runs contrary to the record evidence ; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere\ndifference of opinion.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 97-0435 at 3 (App. Bd. July 14, 1998) (citing\nSupreme Court decision).  \nDepartment Counsel persuasively argues that the Administrative Judge erred in concluding\nthat the four incidents are not part of a pattern and that the Judge had engaged in piecemeal analysis.\nThe Judge concluded that Alcohol Consumption Disqualifying Conditions 1 and  5  applied to\n2\n3\nApplicant, and that Disqualifying Condition 5 applied to Applicant because of excessive alcohol\nconsumption during college and his military service.  Decision at 6.  The record also establishes that\nApplicant had two alcohol-related driving incidents in December 1987 and one in July 2000.    Even\n4\nthough the 2003 incident may not have resulted in a conviction for driving while intoxicated, it was\nanother alcohol-related driving incident that followed a similar pattern as the conduct in the first\n1987 incident and in 2000.  It occurred after socializing with current or former friends and colleagues\nand resulted in an arrest due to abuse of alcohol in conjunction with the operation of a motor vehicle.\nThe Judge concluded that the four incidents were unrelated because the two December 1987\nincidents were too remote and the January 2003 incident was a \u201cone-time relapse, akin to a sober\nalcoholic \u2018falling off the wagon\u2019\u201d after a \u201cboys\u2019 night out.\u201d  The Judge recognized that \u201cApplicant\nwas not acquitted of DWI after his July [sic] 2003 arrest,\u201d but as stated earlier, regarded the\ndisposition of charges \u201cas sufficiently close to an acquittal to constitute a mitigating condition.\u201d \nAn \u201cacquittal\u201d connotes an adjudication on the merits of a criminal case that results in a\nfinding of not guilty.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 00-0016 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 23, 2000).  The Board\nhas held that it is arbitrary and capricious for a Judge to apply Criminal Conduct Mitigating\nCondition 5 absent evidence of acquittal.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-00741 at 6-7 (App. Bd. Nov.\n15, 2005).  A review of the 2003 incident indicates that Applicant was not acquitted; moreover, the\noutcome of the legal proceedings cannot plausibly be characterized as something equivalent to an\nacquittal.  In this case, Applicant was convicted by a jury of a second offense driving while\nintoxicated, but was granted a new trial.  The prosecutor could have re-prosecuted the driving while\nintoxicated charge, but for whatever reason, declined to do so when Applicant pled guilty to the non-\nalcohol charge.   As the Judge stated, the Applicant was sentenced to 3 days in jail, a $2,000 fine,\n24 months of probation, and 24 hours of community service, which is a heavy fine for a non-alcohol\ndriving offense.   Additionally, the record indicates that Applicant was subject to alcohol evaluation,\nparticipation in a repeat offenders program, and preclusion of Applicant from driving a vehicle that\ndid not have an alcohol level monitoring system installed.   See Government Exhibit 11.\n\n\u201cThe alcohol related incidents do not indicate a pattern\u201d (Directive \u00b6 E2.A7.1.3.1). \n5\n\u201cThe crime was an isolated incident\u201d (Directive \u00b6 E2.A10.1.3.2). \n6\n\u201cThe problem occurred a number of years ago and there is no indication of a recent problem\u201d (Directive \u00b6\n7\nE2.A7.1.3.2). \n\u201cThe criminal behavior was not recent\u201d (Directive \u00b6 E2.A10.1.3.1).  \n8\nAlcohol Consumption Mitigating Condition 3 (Directive  \u00b6 E2.A7.1.3.3).\n9\nCriminal Conduct Mitigating Condition 6 (Directive \u00b6 E2.A10.1.3.6). \n10\n6\nConsidering this record, the Judge erred in his decision that Applicant\u2019s outcome could be viewed\nas equivalent to an acquittal for mitigation purposes.   See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-07714 at 3 (App.\nBd. Oct. 19, 2006).\n      \nConsidering their factual similarity, the Administrative Judge\u2019s conclusions that the four\nalcohol incidents do not indicate a pattern,  and that the crimes were isolated,  are not sustainable.\n5\n6\nBecause the security significance of the alcohol-related behavior began when Applicant was in\ncollege and continued episodically until at least 2003, and the associated criminal conduct continued\nepisodically from 1987 until at least 2003, the Judge could not apply Alcohol Consumption\nMitigating Condition 2  and Criminal Conduct Mitigating Condition 1  so as to fully mitigate the\n7\n8\ngovernment\u2019s security concerns.  The remaining question is whether the Judge\u2019s conclusions that (a)\nthere are positive changes in behavior supportive of sobriety  and (b) clear evidence of successful\n9\n(criminal conduct) rehabilitation,  are sustainable. The Judge based his favorable sobriety\n10\nconclusions on the following: (a) that \u201cApplicant substantially changed his drinking habits after his\nDWI conviction in 2000; (b) that the January 2003 arrest was a one-time relapse; (c) that Applicant\nno longer socializes with his old drinking friends; (d) that he has become very family-oriented; (e)\nand that he has established a reputation as an outstanding and dependable worker.  Decision at 6-7.\nThe Judge also recognized that clear evidence of successful rehabilitation is dependent on the\npassage of a significant period of time without recurrence of past misconduct.  Decision at 7.  \nAlthough he mentions that Applicant made changes in his lifestyle and behavior, the primary\nbases for the Administrative Judge\u2019s application of Criminal Conduct Mitigating Condition 6 are the\npassage of six years since Applicant\u2019s last DWI conviction and more than three years \u201csince his\nquestionable arrest for DWI and its generally favorable disposition.\u201d  Decision at 8.   In view of the\nJudge\u2019s unsustainable characterization of the 2003 incident and its legal disposition, and his\nerroneous comparison of the 2003 with the 1987 and 2000 incidents, the record does not contain\nsufficient record evidence to sustain the Judge\u2019s successful application of Criminal Conduct\nMitigating Condition 6.  While the Judge had to consider Applicant\u2019s testimony that he no longer\nsocializes with old drinking friends and other testimony indicating lifestyle changes toward sobriety,\nthe Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant made positive changes in behavior supportive of sobriety is\npredicated in significant part on the findings that Applicant changed his drinking habits after his\nDWI conviction in 2000 and that the January 2003 arrest was a one-time relapse.  These two findings\nare untenable considering the record evidence as a whole.  \n\n7\nWhen an appealing party demonstrates factual or legal error, the Board must consider\nwhether: (a) the error is harmful or harmless; (b) the non-appealing party made a persuasive\nargument for how the Administrative Judge's decision can be affirmed on alternate grounds; and (c)\nif the Administrative Judge's decision cannot be affirmed, should the case be reversed or remanded.\nIn this case, Department Counsel has demonstrated harmful error, and the Judge\u2019s decision cannot\nbe affirmed on alternate grounds.  Considering the record evidence as a whole, the amount of time\nthat the security significant conduct had existed, and the necessity to resolve any doubts in favor of\nnational security (Directive \u00b6 E2.2.2), it is unlikely that a favorable clearance decision would be\nsustainable and that the identified errors could be remedied by remand.  See ISCR Case No. 03-\n22861 at 3 (App. Bd. June 2, 2006).  Viewed cumulatively, the Judge\u2019s errors warrant reversal.   See\nISCR Case No. 03-10380 at 7 (App. Bd. July 28, 2006). \nOrder\nThe decision of the Administrative Judge granting Applicant a clearance is REVERSED. \n  \nSigned: Michael Y. Ra\u2019anan  \nMichael Y. Ra\u2019anan\nAdministrative Judge\nChairman, Appeal Board\nSigned: Michael D. Hipple      \nMichael D. Hipple\nAdministrative Judge\nMember, Appeal Board\nDissenting Opinion\nI respectfully disagree with my colleagues, particularly in their analysis of the disposition of\nthe 2003 offense.  The three documents to which my colleagues refer in their discussion of the\nJudge\u2019s findings, taken together, appear to constitute a final disposition of the July 2003 DWI charge\nunder circumstances that preclude retrial.  U.S. Const. amend. V, cl. 2.  In my view, the resolution\nof Applicant\u2019s case is legally the same as if Applicant had been found not guilty following a trial on\nthe merits.  \n An acquittal does not necessarily mean that the defendant was factually innocent of the\ncharged offense.  In a given case, it may signify nothing more than that the government\u2019s admissible\nevidence was insufficient to prove his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.  Indeed, the Supreme Court\nhas recognized that post-conviction resolutions favorable to the defendant can be the same as an\nacquittal  for purposes of Double Jeopardy.  See, e.g., Monge v. California, 524 U.S. 721, 729 (1998)\n(\u201cWe have held that where an appeals court overturns a conviction on the ground that the prosecution\nproffered insufficient evidence of guilt, that finding is comparable to an acquittal and the Double\nJeopardy clause precludes a second trial.\u201d)(emphasis added).  The Supreme Court has stated that\nwhat constitutes an acquittal is not the particular form wherein a court\u2019s ruling is expressed but\n\n8\nwhether the ruling resolves some or all of the factual elements of a charged offense.  United States\nv. Martin Linen Supply Co., 430 U.S. 564, 571 (1977).   \nIn light of this, I see no legally significant difference between the situation described in\nMonge and that underlying Applicant\u2019s case.  In the former, an appellate court reversed a conviction\non the ground of insufficient evidence.  In the latter, an appellate court vacated a conviction as being\n\u201ccontrary to law and evidence,\u201d and in the subsequent prosecution accepted a plea to a lesser offense,\ndismissing the more serious charge.  Both Monge and Applicant\u2019s case were resolved in a manner\nthat precludes retrial. Certainly the record evidence in Applicant\u2019s case provides no basis to suspect\notherwise.  Indeed, there can be no doubt that, had the this been the initial resolution of Applicant\u2019s\ncase rather than the result of action taken on appeal, we would not be discussing this issue.\nTherefore, I find no error in the challenged conclusion by the Judge. \nI also disagree with my colleagues\u2019 view that the Judge analyzed the case in a piecemeal\nfashion.  To the contrary, I conclude that his analysis satisfies the requirements of Directive  \u00b6\nE2.2.1, in that he considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s conduct in reaching his decision.  See ISCR\nCase No. 04-09959 (App. Bd. May 19, 2006).  This is not to say that I would necessarily have\nreached the same decision as the Judge, only that I do not believe his decision to be arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  I would affirm the decision of the Judge.  \nSigned: James E. Moody    \nJames E. Moody\nAdministrative Judge\nMember, Appeal Board\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant denied all of the allegations in the SOR. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 68 years old. She has worked for a defense contractor for almost 26 years. She is a senior administrative assistant and has held a secret security clearance since 1983. She married in 1964 and divorced in 1998. She has two adult sons, ages 42 and 39.2 The SOR lists 67 delinquent debts in the form of foreclosed properties (four), judgments (25, aggregate balance $624,388), tax debts (13, aggregate balance $52,130), repossessed properties (24, aggregate value $1,135,000) and a charged-off credit card ($7,675). Applicant did not know which alleged debt applied to a specific property and she was unable to detail what tax debt was applied to a specific property. While married to her husband, Applicant jointly invested in real estate. She stated she signed the real estate documents and the closing contracts to purchase the proprieties. They jointly purchased approximately 40 properties for investment. They began making the purchases in 1985. She stated she did not participate or have knowledge about the properties and he did not keep her informed. She also participated in obtaining 35 jointly held credit cards.

Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \nOn February 12, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under \nGuidelines F. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines \n(AG) effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, \n2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on March 6, 2009, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on April 27, 2010. \nDOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on May 5, 2010. I convened the hearing as scheduled \non May 24, 2010. The Government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 9. Applicant did not \n \n1 \n \n \nJune 22, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                          \nobject and they were admitted. Applicant testified and offered Exhibits (AE) A through I, \nwhich were admitted without objection. The record was held open until June 15, 2010, \nto allow Applicant to submit additional documents in support of her case. Department \nCounsel contacted Applicant on the date the record closed to confirm she did not have \nadditional documents to submit. She confirmed she did not submit any documents and \nthe record closed.1 Department DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on June 2, \n2010.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant denied all of the allegations in the SOR. After a thorough and careful \nreview of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 68 years old. She has worked for a defense contractor for almost 26 \nyears. She is a senior administrative assistant and has held a secret security clearance \nsince 1983. She married in 1964 and divorced in 1998. She has two adult sons, ages 42 \nand 39.2  \n \n \nThe SOR lists 67 delinquent debts in the form of foreclosed properties (four), \njudgments (25, aggregate balance $624,388), tax debts (13, aggregate balance \n$52,130), repossessed properties (24, aggregate value $1,135,000) and a charged-off \ncredit card ($7,675). Applicant did not know which alleged debt applied to a specific \nproperty and she was unable to detail what tax debt was applied to a specific property.  \n \nWhile married to her husband, Applicant jointly invested in real estate. She stated \nshe signed the real estate documents and the closing contracts to purchase the \nproprieties. They jointly purchased approximately 40 properties for investment. They \nbegan making the purchases in 1985. She stated she did not participate or have \nknowledge about the properties and he did not keep her informed. She also participated \nin obtaining 35 jointly held credit cards. However, she was fully aware of what she was \nsigning. She also jointly signed, with her husband, 15 lines of credit. She confirmed she \nsigned the contracts over a 25-year period. She said that he purchased the properties \nagainst her wishes. When asked if she was coerced, she stated \u201cno,\u201d but she was \n\u201cpersuaded.\u201d She admitted she was aware of all of the accounts. She confirmed she \nwas the owner of the properties. She stated:  \n \nI signed my name to all the credit cards and lines of credit that my \nhusband opened while we were married. In hindsight, I would not do that, \nbut he handled the finances and I took his advice. Also, until he went off \nhis medication permanently when we divorced, he had handled our \nfinances responsibly.3  \n \n1 Hearing Exhibit I is an email confirmation from Department Counsel.  \n \n2 Tr. 52-56. \n \n3 Tr. 27-28, 37-38, 49. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                                          \nApplicant\u2019s husband requested a divorce and she filed for one in 1998. She was \nrepresented by a lawyer. The divorce decree made the husband responsible for the \ncredit cards and lines of credit. However, the credit card companies would not remove \nher name from the cards. She closed the credit card accounts and her husband would \nreopen some of them, telling the companies that the cards were lost or stolen. He \nreopened credit card accounts and he used her name without her permission. She \ncontacted the credit card companies and advised them of the circumstances and they \nclosed the accounts. Applicant did not provide specific details as to which SOR \nallegations were accounts that her husband opened and she is not responsible for.4  \n \nAlso part of Applicant\u2019s divorce settlement was that she would receive 20 of the \nproperties she and her husband had jointly purchased. He would receive the other 20. \nHer name remained on the mortgages for the properties her husband received. She \nconsidered the 20 properties she received in the divorce settlement as investments that \nwould help provide financial security for her when she retired. She stated she kept the \nproperties for a few years, attempted to pay the mortgages, and would occasionally pay \nthe taxes for a few years until she could no longer keep up with them. She knew she \nwas behind in paying the taxes. She would pay the real estate taxes \u201cpiecemeal,\u201d5 that \nis, when she could. She was receiving rental income at the time. At one point, she \ncontacted the state tax department to work out a payment plan. The tax department \nwanted a lump-sum payment. She could not pay it, so she stopped paying completely. \nShe admitted that she could have paid the taxes if she had used her personal funds. \nApplicant learned that the properties could not be sold because of the tax liens that \nwere on them.6 \n \nIn approximately 2001, Applicant stopped paying the mortgages on most of her \nproperties. She stated the mortgage companies and banks would not take the \nproperties because she had tax liens on them. Applicant stated that she contacted one \nof the banks, but it considered some of the properties as a package. She held a portion \nof the properties in the package and her ex-husband held the other portion. The ex-\nhusband stopped paying the mortgages and Applicant stated the bank advised her that \nshe should stop paying also. She decided to let the properties go to foreclosure. She \nstated all of her properties were foreclosed during the past eleven years. The last two \nwere foreclosed in approximately November 2008. She continued to make mortgage \npayments on these properties until approximately 2003. She continued to rent the \nproperties and had tenants in them as late as 2007, even though she stopped paying \nthe mortgage in 2003. It is noted that for the last two properties, she cancelled the \ninsurance on one in March 2009 and the other July 2009. She notes the deeds changed \nin 2009. She believes these properties were sold for an amount in excess of their \nmortgage and she may receive a profit from the sale, although she acknowledged it \n \n4 Tr. 27-51, 56. \n \n5 Tr. 58-60. \n \n6 Tr. 27-51, 56-60. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                                          \nwould not be for a couple of years.7 No documents were provided to substantiate her \nposition. \n \nApplicant explained the reason she held onto the properties even though she fell \nbehind in the mortgage payments and taxes, and did not attempt to sell them was \nbecause: \u201cI was trying to hang onto my properties because I felt that they would be my \nnest egg. I did try. I eventually gave up.\u201d Applicant also agreed that had the properties \nbeen profitable she would have been happy to accept the windfall and she would have \npaid her debts. She concurred that it was a bad financial proposition that she was \ninvolved in, but blames her ex-husband for creating a situation which caused her \nhardship and her inability to maintain the property.8 \n \nApplicant stated that all of the properties were sold by the sheriff\u2019s office and \nnone of them had deficiency balances owed and all of the tax liens were satisfied. GE 7 \nreflects a current list of judgments and liens from the state. She did not do anything to \ndispute the judgments. The record was held open to allow Applicant the opportunity to \ncontact the appropriate tax offices and provide documentation to show the tax liens \nwere paid and the properties did not have a deficiency owed. She did not provide any \ndocumentary evidence to support her position.9  \n \nApplicant stated that her ex-husband failed to maintain the properties that he \nobtained in the divorce settlement. He did not pay the taxes on the properties. She did \nnot provide information as to which properties listed on the SOR were given to him and \nwere his responsibility.10  \n \nThere were also five properties that were owned by Applicant, her ex-husband, \nand a partner. When the partner sued them, she ceded her interest in the properties to \nthe partner. Applicant\u2019s position was that her ex-husband did not maintain the \nproperties. He abandoned them or left them in disrepair. He did not maintain the houses \nhe owned and failed to pay the taxes. However, she did not provide any information to \nshow which properties that were listed on the SOR belonged to her husband. She did \nprovide a chart she made that lists properties, the dates they were foreclosed, when the \ninsurance was cancelled and a column labeled \u201cdeed changed.\u201d No official supporting \ndocuments were provided.11  \n \nApplicant stated that her ex-husband was mentally ill. She provided a document \nfrom his doctor verifying his condition. She attempted to have the court order a guardian \n \n7 Tr. 27-51, 102-104, 107-113, 119-120; AE I. \n \n8 Tr. 62, 72-75. \n \n9 Tr. 41-51, 69. \n \n10 Tr. 61. \n \n11 Tr. 37, 44-48, 77-78; AE I. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                                          \nfor him. Her request was originally denied. He stopped paying on the mortgages of the \nproperties in December 1998, after they divorced. Later a guardian was appointed for \nhim and bankruptcy was filed on his behalf. However, because Applicant\u2019s name \nremained on the mortgage documents, the creditors looked to her for payment.12  \n \n \nApplicant hired lawyers to help her with her real estate problems. After her \ndivorce she had property managers for the properties. She paid the mortgages from the \nrental income she received. She stated she filed the appropriate annual tax returns for \nthe properties.13  \n \nApplicant did not use any money she received from her salary or savings to pay \nany of the bills associated with the properties. She did not organize her properties to \nlimit her personal liability. She used whatever income she received from the properties \nto pay the mortgages, expenses, and taxes. If the properties did not earn enough \nincome, she did not pay the associated bills. She decided when she could no longer \nmake the payments she would let the properties be foreclosed. She stated \u201cI realized I \nwould lose all my property.\u201d Her position was that she was not going to commingle her \nbusiness income and expenses with her personal finances. If her business was failing \nand she could not pay bills, she would not use her personal finances to pay them.14  \n \nApplicant\u2019s position is that everyone has been paid and all the liens satisfied. She \ndid not submit any documented proof. Applicant provided a copy of a credit report. It \nincluded pages 1 through 8; pages 9 through 14 were not included. It did not list the tax \nliens or judgments alleged. The Government produced earlier credit reports reflecting \njudgments and liens. The Government also provided documents of the state\u2019s judgment \nand lien filings.15 \n  \n \nApplicant provided proof that she pays her monthly personal expenses on time. \nShe has four credit cards that are paid every month. She stated she has a good credit \nrating and lives within her means. She owns a condominium and earns a good income. \nShe also collects Social Security payments. She has a car loan that will be completely \npaid in October 2010. She stated: \u201cAlthough I lost all my properties which formed the \nbasis of my future nest egg, I completely built myself up from scratch with no help \nthrough hard work and saving.\u201d She further stated: \u201cI will be receiving funds from the city \nfrom the sale of my last two properties.\u201d Applicant expects to receive a profit from the \nsale of the remaining property she owned.16  \n \n \n12 Tr. 41-43. \n13 Tr. 41-43. \n \n14 Tr. 102-104. \n \n15 Tr. 82-85, 102-104; AE D, GE 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.  \n \n16 Tr. 43-44; AE C, D. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n                                                          \n \nI considered all of the documents Applicant provided, to include performance \nassessments, awards, a budget, and character letters. Letters from her brother and \nsons confirm that her ex-husband had mental problems. They believed she had severed \nties with the rental properties when she divorced. They believe her financial situation is \nstable and she demonstrated honorable behavior.17 \n \n \nCharacter letters were also provided by friends and co-workers. She is described \nas follows:  \n \n\u2022 She is a financially responsible person and her performance is exemplary. \n\u2022 She achieves a high standard for efficiency, accuracy, and thoroughness.  \n\u2022 She is a person of superb character, performance and professionalism.  \n\u2022 She is a trustworthy person with strong moral character. \n\u2022 She is strong and independent.18  \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \n \n17 Tr. 27; AE A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H.  \n \n18 AE A. \n\n \n7 \n \n \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of the disqualifying conditions under AG & 19 and especially considered: \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nAppellant has a history of being unwilling or unable to meet her financial \nobligations. She has judgments, tax liens, and other debts that are not resolved. I find \nthere is sufficient evidence to raise the above disqualifying conditions.  \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. I have considered the following mitigating \nconditions under AG \u00b6 20: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s behavior is recent because she has not provided documented proof \nthat she has resolved any of the alleged judgments, tax liens, or debts. I find AG \u00b6 20(a) \ndoes not apply. \n \n \nApplicant attributes the judgments, liens, and debts raised in the SOR to actions \nby her ex-husband in acquiring property and then defaulting on it. She provided \nevidence that he was mentally unstable. However, Applicant confirmed she was aware \nof the legal documents she was signing. She was not coerced into being a part of his \nbusiness ventures. When Applicant and her husband divorced, as part of the property \nsettlement, she received 20 properties. She viewed the properties as investments for \nher retirement. She kept the properties, hired property managers, and accepted rental \nincome. All these actions were taken in her capacity as owner. Her last property was \nforeclosed in 2008, ten years after her divorce. Regardless of what transpired before the \ndivorce, Applicant accepted properties as part of the marital settlement. She was given \nan opportunity to provide information to show which of the 67 alleged debts were for \nproperties that were awarded to her husband in the divorce settlement and which were \nawarded to her. She did not provide that information. Applicant kept the properties she \nwas awarded in the divorce settlement. When the properties were not profitable, she \nwanted to absolve herself of responsibility. She stated all the properties were sold, \ndeficiencies were paid, taxes were satisfied, and she is not responsible for them any \n\n \n9 \n \n \nlonger. Perhaps that is the case, but she did not provide any documents to substantiate \nher statements, despite being afforded additional time to do so. To a small extent, her \nex-husband\u2019s condition was beyond her control. However, she signed legal and binding \ndocuments. She accepted property as part of a divorce settlement. Based on her \nactions she was the owner. Her ex-husband\u2019s condition marginally raises the application \nof AG \u00b6 20(b). In order for that mitigating condition to be fully applicable, Applicant must \nhave acted responsibly under the circumstances. In this case, as addressed above, \nApplicant has not done so. AG \u00b6 20(b) has limited application. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s failure to detail which debts were for properties owned by her ex-\nhusband and which were hers, and her failure to provide proof that the tax liens were \nsatisfied and other deficiencies were paid, indicate the problem is not resolved or under \ncontrol. She has not made a good-faith effort to repay creditors or resolve the debts. I \nfind AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) do not apply.  \n \n \nApplicant disputes all of the debts alleged, but failed to provide any documents to \nsupport her position. She categorically stated the judgments were satisfied, the tax liens \nare paid, and there are no deficiencies on the foreclosed and repossessed properties. \nDespite being given an opportunity to provide proof, she failed to do so. I find AG \u00b6 \n20(e) does not apply. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment.  \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \nApplicant has an excellent work record. She received many awards and \naccolades for her performance. She was married to a man that had a mental condition. \nApplicant contractually obligated herself by signing real estate contracts, lines of credits, \nand holding joint credit cards. She admitted she was not coerced into participating in her \nhusband\u2019s financial endeavors. Later, when they divorced, the property was divided. \nShe accepted the properties as part of their divorce settlement. Applicant hoped the \nproperty would be a good investment for her retirement. When they proved not to be, \nshe defaulted on the mortgages and failed to pay the taxes. Although not unsympathetic \nto the difficult familial situation Applicant was confronted with, the fact remains that \nwhen she divorced she accepted ownership of the property. She cannot, more than \ntwelve years later, continue to absolve herself of financial responsibility for the \nproperties she accepted and managed for the past years. She was given an opportunity \nto show which properties on the SOR belonged to her and which may have been \nawarded to her ex-husband, but she did not provide the information. She was given an \nopportunity to provide supporting documents to show the tax liens, judgments, and \nother debts were paid or resolved. She did not provide any documents. Therefore, the \nrecord evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to \nmitigate the security concerns arising under the guideline for Financial Considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.bo:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. Eligibility \nfor access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nCarol G.

On October 7, 2005, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons  (SOR)\n1\ndetailing the basis for its decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline E (Personal Conduct)\nand Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) of the Directive. Applicant answered the SOR in writing on\nNovember 4, 2005, and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was\nassigned to me on December 15, 2006. A notice of hearing was issued on March 6, 2007, scheduling\nthe hearing for March 21, 2007. Applicant waived the 15-day notice requirement. With the consent\nof the parties, the hearing was conducted as scheduled to consider whether it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. The Government\noffered six exhibits that were marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 6, and admitted\nwithout objection. Department Counsel\u2019s list of exhibits was marked as Hearing Exhibit (HE) II.\nApplicant testified and offered four exhibits that were marked Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through\nD, and admitted without objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on March 30, 2007.\nRULINGS ON PROCEDURE\nDepartment Counsel requested that three witnesses testify via video teleconference (VTC).\nApplicant did not object, and the three Government witnesses testified via VTC. E-mail\ncorrespondence on this subject was marked as HE I.\nDepartment Counsel requested that administrative notice be taken of provisions of the Joint\nEthics Regulation (HE III), the calendar for 2001 (HE IV), and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 (HE V). Applicant\ndid not object, and I took administrative notice of those items.2\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the allegations in the SOR are incorporated herein. In addition,\nafter a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following\nfindings of fact.\nApplicant is a 28-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He is a high school graduate.\nApplicant enlisted in the U.S. Army right out of high school. He served four years, and was\nhonorably discharged as a Sergeant (E-5). He has held a security clearance since he was in the Army.\nApplicant is single with no children.3\n\nTr. at 52-58, 116-117; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 3, 4, 6; AE A.\n4\nTr. at 21-22, 120-121; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; HE III.\n5\nTr. at 31, 55-56, 60-61, 73-74; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR.\n6\nTr. at 56-58.\n7\nTr. at 58; HE IV.\n8\n4\nAfter he left the Army, Applicant obtained a temporary job through a staffing agency.\nApplicant was employed by the staffing agency, but worked directly for a defense contractor in a\nSensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF), aboard a military installation. Applicant\u2019s\nsupervisors were employees of the defense contractor company, not the staffing agency. He was\nhired to temporarily fill a position until a full time employee could be hired. His employment dates\nwere set to run from June 2001 through September 15, 2001.4\nApplicant did not have SCI access at that time and had to be escorted while he was in the\nSCIF. Applicant used his government computer to access adult web sites on several occasions. The\nweb sites contained images of nude adult women, what is commonly referred to as pornography.\nWhen the web sites are accessed, some of the material on the site is automatically saved to the hard\ndrive. The use of the government computer to view pornography was against the Joint Ethics\nRegulation (JER) and local regulations. Applicant may not have specifically known of the provisions\nof the JER, but he was aware that accessing pornographic web sites on his government computer was\nunauthorized.5\nThere is conflicting evidence as to whether Applicant was assigned a password and was able\nto log onto the system by himself, or if he had to be logged on by someone else. Applicant testified\nthat he never received a password, and would be logged onto the system by another employee. The\ngovernment witnesses testified they believed that Applicant was issued his own password and access,\nbut acknowledged that they were uncertain of that fact.  I find that there is insufficient evidence to\n6\nprove that Applicant had his own password, and was able to log onto the system on his own.\nPrior to Applicant\u2019s projected employment end date of September 15, 2001, the defense\ncontracting company hired a full time employee for Applicant\u2019s position. The area supervisor\ninformed Applicant that they hired a full time employee, and that Applicant\u2019s last day of work would\nbe Friday, September 7, 2001.7\nMonday, September 3, 2001, was Labor Day. Applicant received a paid day off for this\nholiday. Applicant\u2019s area supervisor was off work on Tuesday, September 4, 2001.8\nSecurity personnel at the military installation monitored the computer system for\nunauthorized use. The security personnel identified that a computer in Applicant\u2019s area was\naccessing adult web sites. In the afternoon of September 4, 2001, security personnel monitored\nApplicant\u2019s computer and saw that it was accessing an adult web site. They went to the SCIF and\nchecked the computers in the room. Applicant had viewed adult web sites within fifteen minutes of\nthe arrival of the security personnel. Security stopped at Applicant\u2019s computer and verified it was\nthe computer in question. Applicant was sitting at the computer when the security personnel arrived\n\nTr. at 23-29, 42-43, 71-79; GE 4; GE 5 at 2; AE A.\n9\nTr. at 122-123; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR.\n10\nTr. at 148.\n11\nId. at 123-124.\n12\nGE 2.\n13\nId.\n14\nId. The statement incorrectly notes throughout that September 5, 2001, and not the correct date of September\n15\n4, 2001, was the date of the incident.\n5\nto check his computer. He was asked to leave the SCIF, and was escorted out of the SCIF by the\nacting area supervisor. Security personnel verified that Applicant\u2019s computer was the one that visited\nadult web sites, and they seized the computer. Security personnel informed Applicant\u2019s supervisor\nwhen he returned to the SCIF that they found pornography on the computer. The supervisor left the\nroom and told Applicant that they found pornography on the computer. Applicant was then sent\nhome. Applicant\u2019s time card shows he ended work one and a half hours early.  \n9\nThe staffing agency called Applicant that evening and told him that he was no longer needed\nat the work site and that his contract was done. The company made no mention of his accessing\npornography, and did not tell him he was terminated.  When asked at the hearing what his\n10\nunderstanding at that time was as to when his last day of work would be, Applicant stated that he\nthought his last day of work would be \u201csome time within that next week and a half,\u201d  and that:\n11\nI knew that it had been shortened or originally it was extended because the person\nquit. They needed to find somebody else to replace that position. I didn\u2019t know how\nlong or how short it was going to be. When I received that phone call I just assumed\nthat they had found somebody and they no longer were going to need me there.12\nApplicant was interviewed by an investigator for the Defense Security Service (DSS) on\nNovember 21, 2002, and provided a written statement. Applicant was questioned about the events\nthat occurred during his last day of employment in September 2001. Applicant denied accessing\npornographic web sites. This was a knowing and willful false statement. He stated that he was never\n\u201caccused of violating or misusing information technology.\u201d  I also find this was a knowing and\n13\nwillful false statement.\nApplicant wrote in the statement that each time he worked on the computer that another\nemployee had to log him onto the computer.  There is insufficient evidence to make a determination\n14\nthat this was a false statement.\nApplicant further stated that September 5, 2001, was to be his, \u201clast day of employment due\nto end of contract,\u201d and that it was \u201ccoincidental the last day of the contract happened to be the day\nthat they confiscated the computer.\u201d  I find that this was a knowing and willful false statement by\n15\nApplicant. \n\nApplicant\u2019s response to the SOR. \n16\nTr. at 122. Any false information provided by Applicant in his response to the SOR or at the hearing is not\n17\nconsidered for disqualifying purposes, but may be considered in assessing Applicant\u2019s credibility, when analyzing the\n\u201cwhole person,\u201d and the potential application of mitigating conditions.\nAE B-D.\n18\nDepartment of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).\n19\n6\nApplicant responded to the SOR on November 4, 2005. He admitted that he accessed\npornography on his government computer, and stated, \u201c[t]his was a one time transgression that I very\nmuch regret.\u201d Applicant admitted he lied in his statement when he wrote that he \u201cnever accessed a\npornographic web site,\u201d but denied that he lied in other parts of the statement. Applicant wrote in\nhis response:\nOn my last day of employment, my actual supervisor was not at work. Therefore, I\nwas being escorted by another employee that worked in the same area as I did. After\nlunch he had to go to a meeting and since I was not permitted to be in the area by\nmyself he told me to go home for the day. I simply casually left the building as I did\non any other day. Once I got home I received a phone call from [staffing company]\nsaying that they no longer needed me for that job, but no reason was given as to why.\nIt was my understanding at the time that September 5, 2001, was to be my last day\nof work. That is why when I was told by [staffing company] on September 4, 2001,\nthat I was not needed to stay I understandably did not think anything of it.16\nApplicant testified that he was never told that he was suspected or accused of accessing\npornography on the computer.  Since I found that Applicant was told that September 7, 2001 was\n17\nto be his last day of work, and that he was informed that pornography was found on his computer,\nI find that Applicant intentionally provided false information in his response to the SOR, and during\nhis testimony at his hearing.\nApplicant is highly regarded by those who know him from the Army and from working with\nhim. He is described as a man of strong values and integrity, honest, candid, someone who has\nalways been one for upholding high standards, adheres to regulations, and is a strong advocate of\nnetwork security. His character letters confirm that they are aware of the allegations against\nApplicant. They believe it to be an isolated incident, and that Applicant has learned his lesson.  His\n18\ncharacter witnesses testified similarly.\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  As Commander in Chief, the President has\n19\n\u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine\nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person\n\nId. at 527.\n20\nExec.

Or. 10865 \u00a7 7.\n24\n7\naccess to such information.\u201d  The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to\n20\ngrant applicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  An applicant has the ultimate burden of\n21\ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his or her\nsecurity clearance. The clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations\nshould err, if they must, on the side of denials.  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant\n22\nshould be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such\nsensitive information.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a\n23\ndetermination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not\nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a\nclearance.  \n24\nThe Directive sets forth potentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions\n(MC) under each guideline. Additionally, each security clearance decision must be a fair and\nimpartial commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the\nwhole-person concept, along with the adjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6 6.3 and \u00b6 E2.2.1 of the\nDirective.\nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those\nwhich would mitigate security concerns, pertaining to the adjudicative guidelines are set forth and\ndiscussed in the conclusions section below.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards discussed above.\nI reach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the SOR.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nConduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations  could indicate that the person may\nnot properly safeguard classified information. \nPersonal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) E2.A5.1.2.1 (Reliable, unfavorable\ninformation provided by associates, employers, coworkers, neighbors, and other acquaintances),\n\nTr. at 78.\n25\nApplicant\u2019s response to SOR at 2.\n26\nPart of the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.d, were that Applicant was terminated from employment, and that\n27\nthe end of his contract was September 15, 2001. I do not find those specific facts.\n8\nand PC DC E2.A5.1.2.4 (Personal conduct or concealment of information that increases an\nindividual\u2019s vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or duress, such as engaging in activities which,\nif known, may affect the person\u2019s personal, professional, or community standing or render the\nperson susceptible to blackmail) apply to Applicant\u2019s accessing pornography on his government\ncomputer. \nPC DC E2.A5.1.2.3 (Deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning\nrelevant and material matters to an investigator, security official, competent medical authority, or\nother official representative in connection with a personnel security or trustworthiness\ndetermination), and PC DC E2.A5.1.2.4 apply to Applicant\u2019s intentional false statement to the\ninvestigator.\nApplicant admitted he lied in one part of his statement, but he denied lying in other parts. I\nobserved Applicant during his testimony, and assessed his demeanor and credibility. I considered\nall the evidence, including Applicant\u2019s inconsistent statements, and admission that he lied to the\ninvestigator about one aspect of the incident. I considered that the government witness testified that\nhe could not state that he was \u201cabsolutely sure\u201d that he mentioned to Applicant that pornography was\nfound on the computer.  I weighed the witness\u2019 testimony with Applicant\u2019s denials. I also\n25\nconsidered Applicant\u2019s version of events that the acting supervisor told him that he had to go to a\nmeeting, and that since Applicant needed an escort, Applicant should go home, so Applicant \u201csimply\ncasually left the building as [he] did on any other day.\u201d  The witness never testified about a meeting.\n26\nApplicant\u2019s version of events is not credible.\nAfter considering all the evidence, I find that Applicant deliberately provided false\ninformation to the DSS investigator when he denied accessing pornographic web sites, when he\nstated that he was never accused of violating or misusing information technology, and when he stated\nthat the day of the incident was to be the last day of his contract.\nI do not find that Applicant was \u201cterminated\u201d from his employment. Applicant was not\nemployed by the contractors at the military installation. They could not terminate his employment.\nHe was employed by the staffing agency. I am satisfied that the staffing agency simply told Applicant\nthat he was no longer needed at the installation. While I find that Applicant provided more than one\nfalse fact in his statement, as substantially alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1d, there was only one\nstatement.  I find this amounts to a single incident of falsification.\n27\nIn his statement, Applicant wrote that he had to be logged onto the computer by another\nemployee. There is insufficient evidence for a finding that the statement was false in that regard. I\nconclude SOR \u00b6 1.c in Applicant\u2019s favor.\n\nISCR Case No. 99-0557 (App. Bd. Jul. 10, 2000).\n28\nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-10502 (App. Bd. April 29, 2004).\n29\n9\nI considered all the mitigating conditions and specifically considered Personal Conduct\nMitigating Condition (PC MC) E2.A5.1.3.2 (The falsification was an isolated incident, was not\nrecent, and the individual has subsequently provided correct information voluntarily), PC MC\nE2.A5.1.3.3 (The individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the falsification before being\nconfronted with the facts), PC MC E2.A5.1.3.4 (Omission of material facts were caused or\nsignificantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of authorized personnel, and the\npreviously omitted information was promptly and fully provided), and PC MC E2.A5.1.3.5 (The\nindividual has taken positive steps to significantly reduce or eliminate vulnerability to coercion,\nexploitation, or duress). \nApplicant was not completely honest to the DSS investigator and at the hearing about what\noccurred when he was viewing pornography on the government computer. He has not significantly\nreduced his vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or duress. Without complete candor, I cannot\napply PC MC E2.A5.1.3.5. \nThe Appeal Board has established the difference between PC MC E2.A5.1.3.2 and PC MC\nE2.A5.1.3.3 when analyzing their application in a falsification case:\nMitigating Condition 2 [E2.A5.1.3.2] is properly used in a case where the\nfalsification is old and the applicant subsequently provides correct information to the\ngovernment about other matters not covered by the old falsification (to elaborate, in\na hypothetical case, if an applicant made a false declaration in 1986 but subsequently\nprovided truthful statements about matters other than the false declaration in his re-\ninvestigations in 1992 and 1999 and did not repeat the false declaration, then\nMitigating Condition 2 would be applicable). In a situation where an applicant seeks\nto correct a falsification, such as the instant case, the potentially applicable factor, if\nthere is one, is Mitigating Condition 3 [E2.A5.1.3.3], not Mitigating Condition 2.28\nApplication of PC MC E2.A5.1.3.3 in Applicant's favor requires that Applicant meet his burden of\nestablishing that he made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct his false statement to the DSS\ninvestigator before being confronted with the facts.  His partial admissions in response to the SOR\n29\nand at the hearing do not constitute a prompt, good-faith effort to correct his falsification before\nbeing confronted with the facts. No mitigating condition is applicable.\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nA history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about an applicant\u2019s judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness.\nIt is a criminal offense to knowingly and willfully make any materially false, fictitious, or\nfraudulent statement or representation in any matter within the executive branch of the Government\nof the United States. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001. Security clearances are within the jurisdiction of the\n\nSee Egan, 484 U.S. at 527. \n30\n10\nexecutive branch of the Government of the United States.  A violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 is a\n30\nserious offense as it may be punished by imprisonment for up to five years. Applicant knowingly and\nwillfully made a materially false statement to an authorized investigator, as discussed above.\nCriminal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (CC DC) E2.A10.1.2.1 (Allegations or admissions of\ncriminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged), and CC DC E2.A10.1.2.2\n(A single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses) both apply. \nI have considered all the mitigating conditions and especially considered Criminal Conduct\nMitigating Condition (CC MC) E2.A10.1.3.1 (The criminal behavior was not recent), CC MC\nE2.A10.1.3.2 (The crime was an isolated incident), and CC MC E2.A10.1.3.6 (There is clear\nevidence of successful rehabilitation), and conclude none apply. Applicant knowingly and willfully\nmade a false statement. I further find that he intentionally submitted false information in his response\nto the SOR, and provided false testimony at his hearing. Under those circumstances, no mitigating\ncondition applies.\nWhole Person Analysis\nThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is an acceptable security risk. Available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in\nreaching a determination. In evaluating Applicant\u2019s case, I have considered the adjudicative process\nfactors listed in the Directive. I have also considered every finding of fact and conclusion discussed\nabove. \nI considered Applicant\u2019s military record and Honorable Discharge. I also considered\nApplicant\u2019s age and favorable character evidence. That evidence is insufficient to overcome the poor\njudgment, untrustworthiness, dishonesty, and unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations\nwhich Applicant displayed by accessing pornography on a government computer, and then lying\nabout it.\nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions and evaluating all the evidence\nin the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns\nbased on his personal conduct and criminal conduct.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.

Norman, Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On December 5, 2005, DOHA issued a statement of reasons advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).

Mogul denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nApplicant timely appealed pursuant to Directive E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.   \nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s findings of fact under\nGuideline F are based in part on a misunderstanding of one of Applicant\u2019s exhibits.  Finding no\nharmful error, we affirm the decision.\nWhether the Record Supports the Administrative Judge\u2019s Factual Findings\nA.  Facts\nThe Judge made the following findings that are pertinent to this appeal: Applicant is indebted\nto the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) on three tax liens for unpaid federal taxes, interest, and\npenalties.  The first allegation is in the amount of $92,733.00; the second $22,445.00; and the third\n$80,209.00.\nApplicant hired an attorney to represent him in his attempts to resolve his tax liabilities.  A\nletter from his attorney (Exhibit L) states that, after February 9, 2007, Applicant will owe only\n$25,000.00, the remainder being uncollectible due to the statute of limitations.  Applicant introduced\na check in the amount of $24,932.00, which he stated would be the means whereby he pays off this\nreduced amount.  The Judge stated, \u201cAt this time, until the IRS responds, I find that Applicant still\nowes the full amount alleged\u201d in the SOR.\nB.  Discussion\nThe Appeal Board\u2019s review of the Judge\u2019s findings of fact is limited to determining if they\nare supported by substantial evidence\u2013such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as\nadequate to support such a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  Directive\nE3.1.32.1.  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing\ntwo inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency\u2019s findings\nfrom being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S.\n607, 620-21 (1966).  In evaluating the Judge\u2019s findings, we give deference to the Judge\u2019s credibility\ndeterminations.  Directive \u00b6  E3.1.32.1.  \nOn appeal, Applicant states that the Judge misunderstood the significance of Exhibit L.  It\n\u201cis not a proposal to the IRS, it is a factual statement from my attorney that there is a plan in place\nwith the IRS that will totally have my debt paid in full in February 2007.\u201d  \nWe have examined the document in question.  Although it is entitled \u201cTax Relief Proposal\nfor [Applicant],\u201d it is not addressed explicitly to the IRS.  It advises the reader that Applicant\u2019s tax\nliabilities are expected to be reduced to the extent and for the reasons described above.  Its language\nis not that normally associated with offers for settlement drafted by lawyers but appears designed to\nadvise any interested party that Applicant will be free of legally enforceable tax debt by the specified\ndate.   \nApplicant, in explaining the document, testified as follows: \u201c[My lawyer] has come to a\nresolution with the IRS, which is stated in the letter that I presented to you . . .We have a resolution\n\n3\nto all the tax problems that\u2013February 9  [2007], which is seven months away, I won\u2019t owe the IRS\nth\nanything.  I\u2019ll be totally paid.\u201d  Transcript at 50.\nGiven the record evidence, we conclude that there is merit in Applicant\u2019s allegation of error.\nThe Judge appears to have interpreted the document as an offer to the IRS.  However, we read it to\nbe a statement of the attorney\u2019s professional opinion that, due to operation of the statute of\nlimitations, Applicant\u2019s enforceable tax debt was, as of the hearing, soon to be reduced by a\nsubstantial amount.  Of course, this error does not impair the Judge\u2019s finding that, as of the date of\nthe decision, Applicant still owed the full amounts alleged.\nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Ultimate Conclusions\nA Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation\nfor\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choices made.\u2019\u201d\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43\n(1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. V. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  The\ngeneral standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests\nof national security.\u2019\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 581, 528 (1988). The Appeal\nBoard may reverse the Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or revoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Directive  \u00b6  E3.1.32.3.  We review matters of law de novo.\nWe must examine whether the erroneous finding identified above is harmful.  In his\nConclusions section, the Judge stated the following: \u201cThe evidence shows that Applicant has . . .\nmade a good faith effort to resolve his debt with the IRS.  Unfortunately at this time he still owes the\nIRS approximately $200,000.00.  It is Applicant\u2019s hope that this debt may be satisfied in February\n2007.  But at this time there is no way to know if the IRS will accept Applicant\u2019s offer in\ncompromise.\u201d Decision at 6.  \nThe Board reads the evidence to show that Applicant is executing a plan to eliminate his\nindebtedness which is heavily dependent upon the running of the statute of limitations.  Such\nreliance does not normally absolve an applicant of his responsibilities for security clearance\npurposes, absent other mitigating circumstances.   See ISCR Case No, 03-04779 at 4 (App. Bd. Jul.\n20, 2005).  The Judge\u2019s mischaracterization of Applicant\u2019s plan is harmless error which if anything\nbenefitted Applicant.  \nMoreover, the Judge noted the following in his Conclusion: \u201cAn additional point of concern\nis that Applicant again exhibited the conduct that got him into trouble previously.  It was his failure\nto file his tax returns in 1989 through 1993 that was the cause of the initial debt to the IRS.

Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.32.3 and E3.1.33.3.\n\u201c[T]here is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance.\u201d  Dorfmont v.

Once the government\nth\npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to establish any\nappropriate mitigating conditions.  See Directive  \u00b6  E3.1.15.  \u201cThe application of disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions and whole person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more\nof them apply to the particular facts of a case.

Dec. 20, 2006).\nIn deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, the Board\nwill review the Judge's decision to determine whether:  it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails\nto articulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of\njudgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision\nthat runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere\ndifference of opinion. In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law, the\nBoard will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of Executive Order 10865, the Directive,\nor other applicable federal law.  See ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006).\nIn resolving the case for  Applicant, the Judge favorably applied Criminal Conduct Mitigating\nConditions (CCMC) 1  and 6.   Department Counsel argues that, concerning CCMC 1, the Judge\n1\n2\nevaluated Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct in a piecemeal fashion, rather than considering it in its\ntotality.  Department Counsel argues that Applicant\u2019s conduct, when viewed as a whole, is\ninconsistent with the Judge\u2019s conclusion that the conduct was not recent.  \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s argument has merit.  As stated above, a Judge\u2019s application of\nmitigating factors must be conducted in light of the record as a whole.  With regard to the recency,\n\u201c[t]he board has declined to furnish  \u2018bright-line\u2019 guidance.  The conclusion . . . that conduct of\nsecurity significance was not recent must be evaluated through careful consideration of the totality\nof the specific record at hand.\u201d   Similarly, CCMC 6 \u201crequires more than just some evidence of\n3\n\nISCR Case No. 01-03695 at 9 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002).\n4\nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-27170 at 4-5 (App. Bd. May 5, 2006). \n5\nDecision at 4. \n6\nApplicant testified that someone had given him the weapon a few months prior to the incident for which he was\n7\narrested.  \u201cQ: And in this instance, you saw your friend was getting into a fight and so you handed him the brass\nknuckles?  A: Right.\u201d  Tr. at 53-54.\n\u201cQ: What were the circumstances surrounding this arrest?  A: I really can\u2019t remember that exact, because we\n8\nfought so much.  I don\u2019t really remember the exact time that I got arrested for that one . . . Q: You remembered that you\nwere ordered to attend ten anger management classes?  A: Right . . . Q: Do you recall that it involved your first ex-wife\n. . . A: Yes.  I know it was my first ex-wife, but I don\u2019t know what the exact fight was about or what happened . . . we\nlived in a trailer park, so screaming and yelling, you can hear it like it\u2019s right in your own trailer . . . Q: Do you recall\nif she was charged with anything at the same time? A . . . She wasn\u2019t.\u201d  Tr. at 40-41.\nThe incident arose out of an altercation between the victim and Applicant\u2019s children.  \u201c[Applicant] dragged\n9\n[victim] by the throat across the road and released his grip on [victim\u2019s] throat. [Victim] hit his head and shoulders on\na tree trunk . . . [Applicant] picked up [victim\u2019s] bicycle and threw it across the road . . .\u201d  Exhibit 9 describes the\nvictim\u2019s throat has having black and blue bruises.  Government Exhibit 9 at 3.\n\u201c[Applicant\u2019s brother stated] that [Applicant] had come over swearing loudly and very upset . . . that\n10\n[Applicant] ran from the house and got a crowbar.  That [Applicant] hit the outside handrail with the crowbar and\ncontinued to swear . . . that [Applicant] came into the house with the crowbar; that the children were in the living room.\n[Brother] said that he got his shotgun and told [Applicant] to leave. [Brother said] he was in fear for the safety of his\nchildren and just wanted [Applicant] out of the house . . . when [Applicant] left the house he hit the handrail again with\nthe crowbar, then threatened [Brother] with the crowbar, saying he would hit him with it. . . if [Brother] did not stop\n\u2018saying stuff\u2019 about his wife.\u201d  Government Exhibit 10 at 3.       \nApplicant testified that an unknown person at a party gave him a marijuana cigarette, which he put in his\n11\npocket, intending to take it to his girlfriend.  The police stopped him as he was illegally walking across a bridge and\ndiscovered the marijuana.  Tr. at 33, 67.  \n4\nrehabilitation.  There must be \u2018clear evidence of successful rehabilitation\u2019 considering the record as\na whole.\u201d   A Judge\u2019s failure to analyze a case in this way can constitute reversible error.\n4\n5\nIn the case under review, the Judge stated, \u201cThe most recent arrest in 2004 is [Applicant\u2019s]\nonly alcohol related incident and he has taken steps to avoid a recurrence.  The second most recent\narrest in 2000 appears to have been a relatively minor matter resulting in a ticket and a fine.  The rest\noccurred over six years ago.  There is clear evidence of rehabilitation from the changes in his conduct\nand the fact that he has had no difficulties since 2004.\u201d   The Judge\u2019s analysis contains no discussion\n6\nof the record as a whole, noting only that most of Applicant\u2019s misconduct occurred more than six\nyears prior to the close of the record.  In so doing, it fails to explain why a pattern of arrests that\nspans a period of over twenty years and includes carrying a dangerous weapon,  domestic\n7\ndisturbance,  assault on a minor,  communicating threatening language,  possession of marijuana,\n8\n9\n10\n11\n\n\u201cI was in the parking lot of a restaurant and I backed into this car.  I tapped this car, and then when I drove\n12\noff, supposedly there was either an off duty police officer or another police officer, and he said he yelled at me as I was\nleaving the parking lot.  Then down the road the other police pulled me over and said, \u201cYou were in an accident in the\nparking lot and you took off.\u201d  I said \u201cNo, I wasn\u2019t.  I tapped the back of a car and I left the parking lot.\u201d  Tr. at 25-26.\n\u201cQ: You were out at dinner . . . ?  A: Yes.  Q: . . . What were you drinking?  A: Budweiser.  Q: . . . [H]ow\n13\nmany do you believe you had?  A: Six, from six at night to midnight . . . Q: . . . Did you have to take a breathalyzer?  A:\nI refused to take a breathalyzer . . . because I didn\u2019t understand why I was getting pulled over in the first place.  Q: Okay,\nbut he\u2019s a police officer.  A: Right.  Q: So why did you refuse the direction of a police officer?  A:   Like I said, I just\ndidn\u2019t  \u2013 he wouldn\u2019t give me a real reason why he pulled me over.\u201d  Tr. at 70-71.     \nDecision at 3.  \n14\nTr. at 64.  \n15\nDecision at 4.  \n16\n5\nhit and run,  and DUI  is not recent simply due to the elapse of three years between the last offense\n12\n13\nand the date of the Judge\u2019s decision.  Indeed, the seven year gap between the assault charge and the\nmarijuana possession militates against a conclusion that Applicant\u2019 misconduct is sufficiently\nattenuated so as to resolve the security concerns which it raises.  See ISCR Case No. 04-12680 at 3\n(App. Bd. May 21, 2007) (A Judge\u2019s decision must be reasonable in light of the contrary record\nevidence.)\nSimilarly, the absence of a meaningful evidentiary discussion vitiates the Judge\u2019s conclusion\nthat Applicant has met his burden of persuasion on rehabilitation.  The Judge noted Applicant\u2019s\nattendance at anger management classes and an alcohol rehabilitation program.  However, again he\ndid not relate the significance of the seven year gap to the question of Applicant\u2019s rehabilitation.\nNeither does the Judge discuss in sufficient detail the record evidence underlying the offenses,\nevidence which is inconsistent with his opinion that most of Applicant\u2019s misconduct concerns the\n\u201cexercise of bad judgement.\u201d   For example, concerning the dangerous weapon charge, Applicant\n14\ntestified that he handed a friend the brass knuckles to assist in a fistfight against a third person.\nGovernment Exhibit 10, a police report describing the July 1991 breach of peace, reports that\nApplicant brandished a crowbar at his brother, threatening him.  Applicant testified that at one point\nhe threatened to kill his brother.   Government Exhibit 9, another police report, describes an assault\n15\non a 13-year old boy, which left bruising.  Applicant also testified about the marijuana incident, in\nwhich he obtained a joint as a present for his girlfriend, and the DUI charge, in which he refused a\npoliceman\u2019s directive to take a breathalyser.    \nAs a matter of common sense, any evaluation of Applicant\u2019s rehabilitation must take into\naccount the inherent seriousness of his criminal conduct and explain why the mere passage of three\nyears from the last offense constitutes \u201cclear evidence of successful rehabilitation.\u201d   The Judge\nacknowledges that Applicant has had \u201cdifficulty with anger management and authority issues.\u201d16\nHowever, his own findings and the record evidence suggest that the latest two incidents both\ninvolved refusing the orders of  policemen, implying that Applicant\u2019s problems with authority are\n\n\u201c[Applicant] has had a series of seven charges or arrests from the time he was 18 in 1982 over a 22 year period\n17\nuntil 2004 when he was 41.  All were separated by at least four years except for two incidents in 1991 and two in 1999\nand 2000 . . . Applicant impressed me . . . as a hard-working person whose anger issues had been a material cause of his\nsporadic problems with the law.\u201d  Decision at 3, 5.\nISCR Case No. 03-27170 at 5 (App. Bd. May 5, 2006).  \n18\nSee U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F. 2d 389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966), cert. denied 385 U.S. 974 (1966) (\u201cThe trier is entitled,\n19\nin fact bound, to consider the evidence as a whole; and, in law as in life, the effect of this generally is much greater than\nthe sum of the parts.\u201d) See also Schulz v. Secretary of HEW, 1987 WL 15314 (DC NJ 1987) (unreported decision),\nreversing an administrative law judge decision which considered various pieces of medical evidence separately rather\nthan as a whole.  \u201c[The ALJ] arrived at [his] judgement through a piecemeal analysis of the medical evidence,\nconsidering separately rather than cumulatively the effects of plaintiff\u2019s conditions.  Thus, the ALJ could not determine\nthe full extent of plaintiff\u2019s disability.\u201d  \nApplicant testified that he went to his brother\u2019s door, yelling.  He stated that he did not enter the house.  The\n20\nbrother came to the door and produced a shotgun, at which point Applicant stated that he went to his car to get the\ncrowbar.  Tr. at 60-64.  Government Exhibit 10 contains a summary of Applicant\u2019s statement to the police.  \u201c[Applicant]\nsaid he had gone into his brother\u2019s home, telling him to leave his wife alone, that he\u2019s had enough of the rumors.  That\nas he was getting in his pick-up truck, he saw his brother standing in the door of the apartment holding a shotgun, so\n[Applicant] got out of the pick-up with the crowbar . . .\u201d  Compare with the brother\u2019s version set forth in Note 10 above.\nTr. at 81. Compare with the victim\u2019s account, described in Note 9 above.  The Police report states that the\n21\nvictim\u2019s account was corroborated by other witnesses.  Government Exhibit 9 at 3.  \n6\nnot merely sporadic, as the Judge described them, but ongoing.   Given that Applicant\u2019s seven year\n17\nhiatus in criminal conduct was followed by incidents in 1999, 2000, and 2004 which indicate at the\nvery least difficulty with self-control and with submission to legitimate authority, we conclude that\nApplicant\u2019s rehabilitation evidence is \u201cinsufficient to rise to the level of \u2018clear evidence of\nrehabilitation\u2019 required under Mitigating Condition 6.\u201d18\nWe have also considered the Judge\u2019s whole person analysis.  While the Judge properly gave\nweight to Applicant\u2019s attendance at various rehabilitation programs, his difficult childhood, and his\nchanged family circumstances, he minimized the seriousness of Applicant\u2019s misconduct, viewing\nit as a string of relatively isolated instances of poor judgement rather than a pattern of criminal\nbehavior, much of it violent.   Additionally, the Judge did not discuss apparent discrepancies\n19\nbetween Applicant\u2019s versions of the two 1991 incidents and those reflected elsewhere in the record\nevidence.  For example, regarding the July incident, Applicant presents his brother as more of an\naggressor than is depicted in the police report.   Also, Applicant claims he did not cause the child\n20\nvictim to strike a tree, as Government Exhibit 9 states.   After considering the Judge\u2019s  findings in\n21\nlight of the record as a whole, we conclude that the Judge\u2019s favorable decision is arbitrary,\ncapricious, and contrary to law.\n\n7\nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge granting Applicant a security clearance is REVERSED.\nSigned: Michael Y.

Jeffreys, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \nGALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns regarding personal conduct and \nfinancial considerations.  Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified \ninformation is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn July 6, 2006, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted an \nEPSQ version of a Security Clearance Application (SF 86).1 On September 16, 2007, \nthe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) furnished him a set of \ninterrogatories pertaining to his financial situation and other unspecified issues. He \nresponded to the interrogatories on November 5, 2007.2 On October 20, 2009, DOHA \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended \nand modified; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \n \n1 Government Exhibit 1 (SF 86), dated July 6, 2006.  \n \n2 Government Exhibit 5-A (Original of Applicant\u2019s Answers to Interrogatories, dated November 5, 2007); \nGovernment Exhibit 5 (Copy of Applicant\u2019s Answers to Interrogatories, dated November 5, 2007. \nMay 21, 2010\n\n \n2 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and modified \n(Directive); and Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to \nClassified Information (effective within the Department of Defense on September 1, \n2006) (hereinafter AG) for all adjudications and other determinations made under the \nDirective. The SOR alleged security concerns under Guidelines E (Personal Conduct) \nand F (Financial Considerations), and detailed reasons why DOHA could not make a \npreliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and \nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance \nshould be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  \n \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on October 26, 2009. In a sworn, \nwritten statement, undated but notarized, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations \nand requested a hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel indicated \nthe Government was prepared to proceed on January 15, 2010, and the case was \nassigned to Administrative Judge Edward W. Loughran on January 27, 2010. It was \nreassigned to me on February 12, 2010, due to caseload considerations. A Notice of \nHearing was issued on March 12, 2010, and I convened the hearing, as scheduled, on \nApril 1, 2010. \n \n \nDuring the hearing, 13 Government exhibits and 2 Applicant exhibits were \nadmitted into evidence, without objection. Applicant and one other witness testified. The \nrecord remained open to afford Applicant the opportunity to supplement it, and on April \n12, 2010, he submitted five additional documents. Four were admitted into evidence as \nApplicant exhibits C through F, respectively, without objection; however, Department \nCounsel objected to the fifth document (Applicant exhibit G for identification) on the \ngrounds that the unsigned document was hearsay and was offered for the truth of the \nmatter asserted. I sustained the objection and rejected the document. The transcript \n(Tr.) was received on April 8, 2010. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the Guideline F factual \nallegations (\u00b6\u00b6 2.a. through 2.z.) and one of the Guideline E factual allegations (\u00b6 1.c.) \nof the SOR. He denied the remaining Guideline E factual allegations (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a. and 1.b.). \n \nApplicant is a 43-year-old employee of a defense contractor, currently serving as \nacting lead technician,3 and he is seeking to obtain a security clearance. He had \npreviously been granted a security clearance in 1984.4 He served on active duty with \nthe U.S. Army from July 1984 until July 1987, and in the Army Reserve from July 1987 \nuntil May 1990.5 After his discharge, Applicant was employed by a number of employers \nin a variety of positions, including electronic bench technician, electronic helper, and \n \n3 Tr. at 36-37. \n \n4 Government Exhibit 1, supra note 1, at 10. \n \n5 Id. at 6. \n \n\n \n3 \n                                      \n \nnce.\n   \n                                                          \nelectronic technician. He also went through a five-month period of unemployment \n(August 1998 until January 1999).6 He has been with his current employer since April \n2006.7 \n \nApplicant has been married since May 1996.8 He and his wife have two children, \nborn in 1995 and 2002, respectively.9  \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \n \nOn March 18, 2002, DOHA issued Applicant an SOR alleging security concerns \nunder Guidelines E (Personal Conduct), F (Financial Considerations), G (Alcohol \nConsumption), and J (Criminal Conduct).10 Applicant elected to have his case decided \non the written record in lieu of a hearing. On September 25, 2002, Administrative Judge \nRichard A. Cefola issued a decision that it was \u201cnot clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.\u201d11Applicant \ncontinued to work for the same employer, but was relocated to a position not requiring a \nsecurity cleara\n12\n \n \nIn response to interrogatories previously sent to him by DOHA, on November 5, \n2007, Applicant submitted a number of letters purportedly from various creditors \nindicating either that he made payment arrangements, had been making payments, or \nthat the creditor had acknowledged errors in reflecting delinquencies. One letter, \npurportedly from the U.S. Department of Education, dated October 29, 2007, with an \nillegible signature, states:13 \n \nIn our recent conversation you had indicated to us that your student loans \nwere listed outstanding on your credit report. We understand our concern \nand want to assure you that you are in excellent standing with the US \nDepartment of Education. All your payments of $630.00 have been \nreceived every month. We would like to Thank You for keeping current \nwith your payments. \n \n \n6 Id. at 3. \n \n7 Id. at 2. \n \n8 Id. at 4. \n \n9 Id. at 4-5. \n \n10 Government Exhibit 7 (Statement of Reasons, dated March 18, 2002). \n \n11 Government Exhibit 6 (ISCR Case No. 00-0744, dated September 25, 2002), at 7.  It was determined that \nApplicant had mitigated only the alcohol consumption concerns. \n \n12 Tr. at 25. \n \n13 Letter from U.S. Department of Education, dated October 29, 2007, attached to Government Exhibit 5-A, \nsupra note 2. \n \n\n \n4 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \nDOHA subsequently followed up on the status of the account (SOR \u00b6 1.p.), and \non December 7, 2007, the U.S. Department of Education sent a letter indicating \nApplicant\u2019s account was in collection, and his payment history reflected the two most \nrecent payment checks had been returned.14 On March 20, 2008, the U.S. Department \nof Education commented on the purported October 27, 2007 letter previously submitted \nby Applicant, which he attached to his response to DOHA\u2019s interrogatories.15 \n \nAfter reviewing the alleged October 29, 2007 Department of Education \nletter sent to [Applicant], our office of Direct Loans . . . was unable to find \nany record that the Department sent this letter. In addition, Direct Loans \nindicated that the letterhead format was incorrect, and that if they had sent \nthe letter, a Direct Loans letterhead would have been used. Additional \nconcerns I find include improper language, an Education address used in \nplace of the borrower\u2019s address and no printed signature block. Based \nupon our research, the letter in question does not appear to be from the \nDepartment of Education; instead, it appears to be some veiled attempt to \nimitate a Department letter. \n \nIn reference to [Applicant\u2019s] account status with the U.S. Department of \nEducation, his balance, as of today, is $100,119.19 (includes principal, \ninterest and projected collection costs). \n \n \nAnother letter, purportedly from a cable provider (SOR \u00b6 1.s.), dated October 23, \n2007, with an illegible signature, refers to previously agreed payment arrangements and \na payment already made.16 In another letter, purportedly from a different cable provider \n(SOR \u00b6 1.q.), dated October 25, 2007, also with an illegible signature, the creditor \napologizes for mistakenly seeking payment on an account in which the unpaid balance \nhad been discharged in bankruptcy in 2002.17 Still another letter, purportedly from an \nautomobile finance company, dated October 24, 2007, again with an illegible signature, \napologizes for an accounting error on Applicant\u2019s account, and states his account is in \n\u201cexecellent standing.\u201d18 The final letter, from a collection agency representing a medical \nprovider (SOR \u00b6 1.r.), dated October 25, 2007, without any signature, acknowledges a \npayment bringing the account to current status.19 \n \n \nApplicant denied drafting, doctoring, forging, making up, or creating any of the \naforementioned letters which he submitted to DOHA in response to the interrogatories, \n \n14 Government Exhibit 4 (Letter from U.S. Department of Education, dated December 7, 2007). \n \n15 Government Exhibit 3 (Letter from U.S. Department of Education, dated March 20, 2008). \n \n16 Letter from cable provider, dated October 23, 2007, attached to Government Exhibit 5-A, supra note 2. \n \n17 Letter from cable provider, dated October 25, 2007, attached to Government Exhibit 5-A, id. \n \n18 Letter from automobile finance company, dated October 24, 2007, attached to Government Exhibit 5-A, id. \n  \n19 Letter from collection agency, dated October 25, 2007, attached to Government Exhibit 5-A, id. \n \n\n \n5 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \nand has no idea why they would have been sent to him if they were not authentic.20 \nApplicant stated he never contacted the U.S. Department of Education regarding their \nletter, but was happy that he had the letter.21 After comparing the style, formats, fonts, \nand signatures of the subject documents, along with the commentary furnished by the \nU.S. Department of Education, I find that the documents are not authentic, and are most \nlikely forgeries.   \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nThere was nothing unusual about Applicant\u2019s finances until about 2002. At some \npoint prior to November 2002, Applicant\u2019s unsecured consumer debt reached a certain \nlevel, and he and his wife decided to file for bankruptcy under Chapter 7 of the U.S. \nBankruptcy Code.22 He listed total liabilities of $157,435, including about $94,000 in \nstudent loans and about $63,435 in unsecured debts.23 In July 2003, the unsecured \ndebts were discharged, but Applicant remained responsible for the student loans.24  \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial habits did not change after the bankruptcy.25 Other than \ndisconnecting cable television, he did nothing to prevent new debts from becoming \ndelinquent.26 He offered no reason for his failure to adjust his habits or address his \nfinancial situation.27 At some unspecified point after the bankruptcy discharge, his \naccounts again became delinquent. Some accounts were placed for collection or \ncharged off. Applicant could not explain why even the smallest of his debts had not \nbeen taken care of.28 \n \n \n20 Tr. at 28-34. It is interesting to note that Applicant Exhibit G for identification, which was submitted after \nthe hearing, and which was objected to by Department Counsel and rejected by me, purports to be a letter from \nApplicant\u2019s wife (unsigned), in which she took full responsibility for forging the identified documents. \n \n21 Id. at 35. \n \n22 Government Exhibit 13 (Combined Experian, Trans Union, and Equifax Credit Report, dated October 18, \n2006), at 5.  \n \n23 Tr. at 55-56. \n \n24 Id. at 56. \n \n25 Id. at 57. \n \n26 Id. at 51. \n \n27 Id. at 49. \n \n28 Id. at 48-51, 69. His comment in this regard is not entirely accurate. On October 4, 2007, Applicant paid \none particular collection agency $977 to be applied to unspecified delinquent accounts, leaving an unpaid balance of \n$284.53. See Receipt for Payment, dated October 4, 2007, attached to Government Exhibit 5-A, supra note 2. On \nNovember 2, 2007, he made payments to four different creditors identified in the SOR: $719 (\u00b6 2.m.), $285 (\u00b6 2.n.), \n$166 (\u00b6 2.s.), and $440 (\u00b6 2.x.). See MoneyGram receipts, also attached to Government Exhibit 5-A, id. \n \n\n \n6 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \n Because of his relative inaction pertaining to his delinquent student loans,29 the \nU.S. Department of Education indicated it intended to collect the debt by administrative \nwage garnishment. Applicant agreed to a rehabilitation plan but the loan was not \nrehabilitated because two payments were returned for insufficient funds.30 Instead, a \nwage garnishment order was sent to Applicant\u2019s employer in October 2008, and \neffective November 21, 2008, the first garnishment payment was received from \nApplicant\u2019s employer.31 As of August 24, 2009, Applicant owed $72,986.72 principal, \n$10,081.36 interest, and $20,218.77 projected collection costs.32 \n \nIn addition to the allegation pertaining to Applicant\u2019s bankruptcy, the SOR \nidentified 25 purportedly continuing delinquencies, including the student loan account, \nas reflected by seven credit reports, including one from 2006,33 three from 2007,34one \nfrom 2008,35 one from 2009,36 and one from 2010,37 totaling approximately $89,901. Of \nthat amount, $83,308 is for student loans. Some accounts have been transferred, \nreassigned, or sold to other creditors or collection agents. Other accounts are \nreferenced repeatedly in the credit reports, in many instances duplicating other \naccounts listed, either under the same creditor or collection agent name, or under a \ndifferent creditor or collection agent name. Some accounts are identified by complete \naccount numbers, while others are identified by partial account numbers, in some \ninstances eliminating the last four digits and in others eliminating other digits. Those \ndebts listed in the SOR, all of which Applicant admitted, and their respective current \nstatus, according to the credit reports, documents submitted by Applicant, and \nApplicant\u2019s written and testimonial comments relative thereto, are described below: \n \n29 Applicant made only \u201csporadic\u201d payments between January 25, 2007 and October 29, 2007, and his loan \nstatus was changed to \u201cdefaulted.\u201d See Government Exhibit 2 (Letter from U.S. Department of Education, dated \nAugust 24, 2009), at 1. \n \n30 Id. \n \n31 Id. \n \n32 Id. \n \n33 Government Exhibit 13, supra note 22. \n \n34 Government Exhibit 12 (Equifax Credit Report, dated September 16, 2007); Merged Infile Credit Report, \ndated November 5, 2007, attached to Government Exhibit 5-A, supra note 2; Government Exhibit 11 (Equifax Credit \nReport, dated December 7, 2007. \n \n35 Government Exhibit 10 (Equifax Credit Report, dated February 29, 2008). \n \n36 Government Exhibit 9 (Equifax Credit Report, dated July 14, 2009).  \n \n37 Government Exhibit 8 (Equifax Credit Report, dated March 26, 2010). \n\n \n7 \n                                      \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 \nTYPE DEBT \nAMOUNT \nSTATUS \n2.a. \nMedical service \n$889 \nCollection.

The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his \ndesignee to grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a \nfinding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d75   \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are useful in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \n \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines \nare applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. \n \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d76 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish \na potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced \nsubstantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \napplicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, \nextenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s \ncase. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.77  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence.

It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to \npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  Furthermore, \n\u201csecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d78 \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no \nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d79 Thus, nothing \nin this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole \nor in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, \nor patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.  In \nreaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, \nand based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing \ninferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15:  \n      \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG \u00b6 16(a), a \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used \nto conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or \nstatus, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary \nresponsibilities,\u201d is potentially disqualifying. Similarly, under AG \u00b6 16(b), \u201cdeliberately \nproviding false or misleading information concerning relevant facts to an employer, \ninvestigator, security official, competent medical authority, or other official government \nrepresentative,\u201d may raise security concerns. Applicant\u2019s submission to DOHA of forged \ndocuments to support his contention that various accounts were no longer delinquent or \nnever were delinquent, provided false and misleading information concerning critical \n \n78 Egan, 484 U.S. at 531 \n \n79 See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \n\n \n12 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \nrelevant facts to DOHA\u2019s personnel security specialist, as well as to me during \nApplicant\u2019s hearing pertaining to his eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. His \nactions provide sufficient evidence to examine if his submissions were deliberate \nfalsifications or were the result of simple oversight or negligence on his part.  \n \nAs noted above, Applicant denied drafting, doctoring, forging, making up, or \ncreating any of the aforementioned letters which he submitted to DOHA in response to \nthe interrogatories. At the hearing, he claimed to have no idea why they would have \nbeen sent to him if they were not authentic. Yet, when he submitted them, he knew, or \nreasonably should have known, the actual state of his financial affairs. Many accounts \nwere already delinquent and he was aware that his limited financial resources were \ninsufficient to satisfy them all. With delinquent student loans approaching $100,000, it \nwas unreasonable for him to assert there was no delinquency. Under the \ncircumstances, I find his denials not to be credible. That is not to say that he actually \ndrafted, doctored, forged, made up, or created the documents, for there is no direct \nevidence that he did so. However, he did use the documents with the presumed \nknowledge that the contents therein were false. I find Applicant\u2019s explanations are \nincredible in his denial of deliberate falsification.80 AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) and 16(b) have been \nestablished. \n \nThe guidelines also include examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from personal conduct under AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(a)-(g). But in this instance, \nnone of the mitigating conditions apply.  \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. . . . \n \n \n80 The Appeal Board has explained the process for analyzing falsification cases, stating: \n \n(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has the burden of proving \nfalsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove an applicant\u2019s \nintent or state of mind when the omission occurred; and (c) a Judge must consider the record \nevidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial evidence concerning the \napplicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the omission occurred. [Moreover], it was legally \npermissible for the Judge to conclude Department Counsel had established a prima facie case \nunder Guideline E and the burden of persuasion had shifted to the applicant to present evidence to \nexplain the omission. \n\n \n13 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG \u00b6 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying. \nLikewise, under AG \u00b6 19(b), \u201cindebtedness caused by frivolous or irresponsible \nspending and the absence of any evidence of willingness or intent to pay the debt or \nestablish a realistic plan to pay the debt,\u201d may also be potentially disqualifying. Similarly, \nunder AG \u00b6 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise security \nconcerns. Also, under AG \u00b6 19(e), \u201cconsistent spending beyond one\u2019s means, which \nmay be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-\nto-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis,\u201d is potentially disqualifying.  \n \nAs noted above, there was nothing unusual about Applicant\u2019s finances until about \n2002, when he and his wife filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy \nCode. In July 2003, $63,435 in unsecured debts were discharged, and his financial \nproblems were eliminated. But not for long, for within a matter of a few years, various \nnew accounts became delinquent. Despite promises to pay certain accounts, and \nclaims to have paid others, with few exceptions, he has failed to keep his bills current. \nAccounts became delinquent and were placed for collection; some were charged off. \nAnd he continued to spend. Now there are additional delinquent non-SOR accounts. It \nappears that when his financial relationship with one cable company came to an \nimpasse, he simply chose to move on to another such company, leaving the original \nprovider with an unpaid account. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.i., 2.q., and 2.s.) The same is true for his \nrelationships with mobile telephone service. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.e., 2.n., 2.o., and 2.w.) While he \nhas submitted some documentation to support his contentions regarding payments \nsupposedly made or accounts supposedly disputed, he has not done so for the \nremaining delinquent accounts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), and 19(e) apply. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition \nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Also, under AG \n\u00b6 20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where Athe conditions that resulted \nin the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of \nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce \nor separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ Evidence \nthat Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are \nclear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@ is potentially \nmitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG \u00b6 20(d) applies where the evidence shows \nAthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise \nresolve debts.@81 Also, AG \u00b6 20(e) may apply where \u201cthe individual has a reasonable \n \n81 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood-faith\u201d effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant must present \nevidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith \naction aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not define the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 \nHowever, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith \u2018requires a showing that a person \nacts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 \n\n \n14 \n                                      \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                          \nbasis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem \nand provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.\u201d  \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems commenced in 2002, were resolved by a Chapter \n7 bankruptcy discharge of his debts in 2003, and eventually re-emerged. Because the \nfinancial situation is frequent and continuing in nature, AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \nApplicant\u2019s handling of his finances, under the circumstances, does cast doubt on his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.  \n \nLikewise, Applicant receives minimal application of AG \u00b6 20(b), for Applicant has \nnot documented evidence that the conditions that resulted in his financial problems at \nsome point were largely beyond his control. He has noted certain family health issues, \nbut has not explained how they interfered with his handling of his finances. Applicant \nfailed to act responsibly under the circumstances. He failed to explain the \ncircumstances regarding his financial problems between 2003 and the present. Rather \nthan consolidating and minimizing expenses, except for dropping cable service, he \ncontinued to spend unwisely. He increased his expenditures and failed to reduce his \ndelinquencies.82  \n \nAG & 20(c) does not apply because Applicant has not received financial \ncounseling and debt consolidation guidance, or if he has, he has not provided \ndocumentation to support any other conclusion. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) only partially applies because Applicant initiated a very limited good-\nfaith effort to repay several creditors, well before the SOR was issued. He made several \npayments in January, October, and November 2007, and again in March 2010, but \nexcept for those payments, ceased all such voluntary action. After years of ignoring his \ndelinquent student loans, or making rare payments, the U.S. Department of Education \ngarnished his wages and is now getting paid \u201cinvoluntarily.\u201d Over the years, Applicant \ndid not act aggressively, timely, or responsibly to resolve his delinquent debts. Instead, \nhe has taken no significant actions to address the satisfaction of those delinquent \ndebts.83  \n \n \nAccordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally \navailable option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the \n\u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition].  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting ISCR Case \nNo. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \n \n82 \u201cEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside his \n[or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when \ndealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd.

Dec. 1, 1999)).  \n \n83 The Appeal Board has previously held that \u201c[A] applicant must do more than merely show that he or she \nrelied on a legally available option (such as bankruptcy) in order to claim\u201d he or she initiated a good-faith effort to \nrepay creditors or otherwise resolve debts. ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004). \n\n \n15 \n                                      \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply because, while Applicant might have a legitimate \nreason to dispute the unknown account set forth in SOR \u00b6 2.y., he has not provided \n\u201cdocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute.\u201d \n  \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \nThere is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct. Well after his \nfinances got out of control, he initiated some belated good-faith efforts to pay some \ndebts, well before the SOR was issued. For a brief period in 2007, he made some minor \npayments to some creditors. Thereafter, all of his efforts ceased, and did not resume \nuntil the day before the hearing. \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. \nApplicant continued to obtain services and goods from a variety of creditors, but either \nhad no ability or intention to pay for them. As a result, he continued to accumulate \ndelinquent debt and did not pay his older debts. In July 2003, $63,435 in unsecured \ndebts were discharged in bankruptcy.  \n \nNevertheless, since his bankruptcy discharge, with the exceptions described \nabove, Applicant did not make significant good-faith efforts to pay a variety of delinquent \ndebts. While he ignored most of his creditors, he made a number of promises and \nclaimed to have paid several creditors. Yet, there is insufficient or questionable \ndocumentation to support his contentions that he had fully, or partially, satisfied some of \nthe creditors. Now, seven years after his debts were discharged under a Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy order, he is again enmeshed in financial disarray. His long-standing failure \nto repay creditors, at least in reasonable amounts, or to arrange payment plans, while \ncreating new debts, reflects judgment traits which raise concerns about his fitness to \nhold a security clearance.  \n \n\n \n16 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \nOf course, the issue is not simply whether all his debts are resolved or at least \nunder repayment arrangements; it is whether his financial circumstances raise concerns \nabout his fitness to hold a security clearance. And there is the personal conduct \nsurrounding the submission to DOHA of the forged documents. I am mindful that while \nany one factor, considered in isolation, might put Applicant\u2019s credit history and personal \nconduct in a sympathetic light, I have evaluated the various aspects of this case in light \nof the totality of the record evidence and have not merely performed a piecemeal \nanalysis.84 His insufficient good-faith efforts or evidence to reflect actual payments to \nhis SOR creditors, and his inability to satisfactorily explain his submission of the forged \ndocuments, are sufficient to raise continuing security concerns. See AG \u00b6 2(a)(1) \nthrough AG \u00b6 2(a)(9). \nThe Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in \nfinancial cases stating:85 \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201c\u2018meaningful track record\u2019 necessarily includes evidence of \nactual debt reduction through payment of debts.\u201d However, an applicant is \nnot required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off \neach and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an \napplicant demonstrate that he [or she] has \u201c . . . established a plan to \nresolve his [or her] financial problems and taken significant actions to \nimplement that plan.\u201d The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of \nan applicant\u2019s financial situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the \nextent to which that applicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of his outstanding \nindebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive \u00b6  E2.2(a) (\u201cAvailable, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d) There is \nno requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts \nsimultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may \nprovide for the payment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no \nrequirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable \ndebt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. \n \nAlthough there are few positive signs in Applicant\u2019s favor, such as his recent \nefforts to take corrective actions, and his maintenance of some of his payments of his \ndaily living expenses, these steps are simply insufficient to show he can \u201clive within [his] \nmeans, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations.\u201d See AG \u00b6 18. Moreover, the \npersonal conduct issues raise questions about his honesty and trustworthiness. Overall, \nthe record evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his personal conduct \nand financial considerations.  \n \n84 See U.S. v.

Clearance is denied.\nOn September 17, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under\nGuidelines G and E.. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant answered the SOR on November 13, 2008, and requested a hearing.\nThe case was assigned to me on February 12, 2009. On February 17, 2009 a Notice of\nHearing was issued originally scheduling the case for March 3, 2009. The hearing was\ncontinued because of inclement weather, and rescheduled for April 6, 2009. It was then\nApril 30, 2009\n\nThese charges were the subject of an earlier security clearance investigation, and were included in an SOR\n1\nissued on July 23, 1991 (Exhibit 12). Because Applicant admitted them then, and an administrative judge\nincorporated them into his findings of fact in a subsequent decision that is part of this record (Exhibit 11), I will\nnot address the specifics of each arrest any further.\n2\nheld as scheduled. I received 26 government exhibits, one Applicant exhibit, and\nApplicant\u2019s testimony. The transcript was received on April 15, 2009.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 57-year-old man with four adult children. He has been divorced for\nmore than 30 years. He has a GED, and served in the U.S. Army from 1972 through\n1973. He received an honorable discharge (Exhibit 9). Since 2001, he has worked for a\ndefense contractor as a shipyard pipefitter (Exhibit 1) He had previously worked in this\noccupation in the early 1990s (Exhibit 15 at 2), and from 1978 to 1980 (Exhibit 25 at 2).\nApplicant has had a problem controlling his alcohol consumption for his entire\nadult life. Although his Army discharge status was honorable, he was released early\nafter Medical Board Proceedings concluded he was temporarily disabled, in part,\nbecause of a history of alcoholism (Answer at 1; Exhibit 8). Between 1974 and 1988,\nApplicant was charged four times with alcohol-related offenses as described in SOR\nsubparagraphs 1.c, 1.d, 1.h, and 1.i.  \n1\nApplicant sought inpatient treatment for his alcohol consumption in December\n1981 (Answer at 2). At that time, he was drinking a fifth of a gallon of liquor and a six-\npack of beer per day (Exhibit 11 at 2). He left the program prematurely without\ncompleting it (Id.). His alcohol counselor stated in a discharge summary that he would\ncontinue to have problems with alcohol abuse so long as he had the same\nuncooperative attitude (Id.).\nAfter leaving the treatment center in 1981, Applicant\u2019s alcohol consumption\nbriefly decreased. By 1985, it again increased. By August 1985, when he re-entered the\ntreatment center, he was drinking a fifth gallon of liquor per day (Id.). Subsequently, a\npsychiatrist diagnosed him with chronic alcoholism (Id.; Exhibit 20 at 2). While enrolled\nin the program, he was prescribed antabuse, received therapy, and attended Alcoholics\nAnonymous (AA) meetings. Upon his discharge, his therapist advised him to continue\nattending AA meetings, and taking antabuse (Id.). \nApplicant remained sober for a few months after his discharge, then began\ngradually relapsing. By May 1986, he was again drinking a fifth gallon of liquor daily (Id.\nat 3). He went to a staff physician at the local VA who diagnosed him with chronic\nalcoholism, and recommended that he return to the treatment center where he had\nbeen treated twice earlier (Exhibit 24). Also, the physician admitted him into the hospital\nto begin treatment while waiting for a bed to become available at the alcohol treatment\ncenter. Applicant was then discharged from the VA after three days because he failed to\nfollow through with his physician\u2019s recommendations (Id.).\n\n3\nApplicant\u2019s continuing problems with alcohol consumption prompted the issuance\nof an SOR in July 1991. At the hearing, Applicant stated he never drank alcohol in the\namounts he told the therapist at the treatment center. Rather, he lied to the therapist so\nthat he could be admitted (Exhibit 14 at 45).\nUpon considering the evidence, the administrative judge granted Applicant a\nclearance (Exhibit 11 at 6). In doing so, he rejected Applicant\u2019s contention that he\npurposefully misrepresented his alcohol consumption to the clinic director to gain\nadmission into the program, and concluded that his contradictory testimony\n\u201cundermined his credibility\u201d (Exhibit 11 at 6).\nOne evening in July 1998, a police officer stopped Applicant for speeding. After\nApplicant informed him that he had been drinking, the officer conducted a field sobriety\ntest (Exhibit 3 at 4). Applicant failed, and was arrested and charged with Driving While\nIntoxicated (DWI), and Refusal to take a Breathalyzer (Answer). Six months later,\nApplicant was found guilty and sentenced to five months in jail, suspended (Answer;\nExhibit 2 at 10).\nOn February 26, 2000, Applicant was arrested and charged with DWI, Reckless\nDriving, and Possession of a Concealed Weapon (Answer; Exhibit 2 at 6). The court\ndismissed the latter two charges, and convicted him of the DWI charge. He was\nsentenced to six months in jail with all but two days suspended, fined $250, and ordered\nto attend outpatient alcohol treatment, in addition to the state\u2019s Alcohol Safety\nAwareness Program (ASAP). As part of ASAP, an ignition interlock device was installed\non his automobile (Id.; Tr. 30). \nApplicant completed the outpatient alcohol treatment. He was diagnosed with\nalcohol dependence, hepatitis C and liver disease (Exhibit 6 at 1).\nOn or about June 15, 2001, a show cause order was filed against Applicant for\nreturning the ignition interlock device without the court\u2019s permission. On August 20,\n2001, he was found guilty, and ordered to participate in ASAP for an additional six\nmonths. He completed ASAP, as ordered (Exhibit 6 at 1).\nApplicant completed another outpatient treatment in 2004 (Exhibit 6). Most\nrecently, he received outpatient treatment in 2008. He underwent a urine screen, testing\npositive for alcohol (Exhibit 6 at 2). The organization\u2019s director, a licensed professional\ncounselor, evaluated him, concluded he was alcohol dependent, and recommended a\n20-week relapse prevention program to include random alcohol testings (Exhibit 6 at 1).\nDuring an initial interview, Applicant told the clinic director that he was engaged\nin AA and the 12-step program. When the clinician asked Applicant to describe the 12\nsteps, \u201che was unable to provide the most basic information about them\u201d (Exhibit 6 at 1).\nAlso, Applicant stated his last use was in 2004, then later revealed he had drunk an\nalcoholic beverage three weeks before the evaluation (Id.).\n\nQuestion 20. Your Use of Alcohol: In the past 7 years, has your use of alcoholic beverages . . . resulted in\n2\nany alcohol-related treatment or counseling (such as for alcohol abuse or alcoholism).\n4\nIn August 2003, Applicant completed a security clearance application. In\nresponse to a question regarding prior alcohol-related arrests, he listed the 2000 DWI,\nbut not the 1998 DWI (Exhibit 1 at 7). He testified that he did not include it because he\nhad forgotten about it (Tr. 29).\nAlso, in response to a question regarding alcohol-related therapy received in the\npast seven years,  Applicant disclosed the 2000 treatment, and listed attendance from\n2\nJuly 2000 through August 2000. The government alleges this is a falsification, asserting\nthat he attended from June 2000 through January 2001. The record evidence is\ninconclusive as to the exact dates of attendance.\nCurrently, Applicant characterizes himself as a beginner in the 12-step program\n(Tr. 33). Also, he stated that he was \u201cnot going to the meetings like [he] was at one\ntime\u201d (Tr. 32).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\n\n5\nAnalysis\nGuideline J, Alcohol Consumption\nUnder this guideline, \u201cexcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise\nof questionable judgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness\u201d (AG \u00b6 21). Applicant has a 40-year\nhistory of alcohol abuse. In that time, he has been arrested multiple times for alcohol-\nrelated offenses, and been diagnosed multiple times with chronic alcoholism or alcohol\ndependence. AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a), \u201calcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving\nwhile under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other\nincidents of concern  . . . ,\u201d 22(c), \u201chabitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point\nof impaired judgment  . . . ,\u201d 22(d), \u201cdiagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional\n(e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of alcohol abuse or alcohol\ndependence,\u201d and 22(e), \u201cevaluation of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence by a\nlicensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol treatment\nprogram,\u201d apply.\nApplicant has relapsed multiple times over the years. As recently as 2001, he\nwas found guilty of contempt of court for failing to follow the conditions of an alcohol-\nrelated court order. AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(f), \u201crelapse after diagnosis of alcohol abuse or\ndependence and completion of an alcohol rehabilitation program,\u201d and 22(g), \u201cfailure to\nfollow any court order regarding alcohol education, evaluation, treatment, or\nabstinence,\u201d also apply.\nI have considered the mitigating conditions, and conclude none apply. After\napproximately 40 years of alcohol abuse, multiple arrests and failed attempts at\ntreatment, Applicant characterized himself as a beginner in the 12-step program, and\nstated he is not attending any 12-step program sessions on a regular basis.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nUnder this guideline, \u201cconduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified\ninformation\u201d (AG \u00b6 15). Although Applicant\u2019s history of alcohol abuse does not trigger\nthe application of any of the specific disqualifying Personal Conduct disqualifying\nconditions, it constitutes a concern under criteria set forth in the guideline\u2019s introductory\nparagraph. Consequently, SOR subparagraph 2.a, which cross-alleges the Alcohol\nConsumption allegations of SOR Paragraph 1, also constitutes a security concern under\nSOR Paragraph 2, Personal Conduct. For the reasons set forth above, none of the\nPersonal Conduct mitigating conditions apply, either. \nThe SOR alleges in SOR subparagraph 2.c that Applicant was charged with\nallowing an unlicensed driver to drive his car in 2000. Applicant successfully rebutted\n\n6\nthis allegation at the hearing, providing evidence that the defendant was his son, who\nshares his name. I find in his favor as to SOR subparagraph 2.c.\nApplicant has provided contradictory information concerning the extent of his\nalcohol abuse and his commitment to alcohol treatment through two separate security\nclearance investigative processes. Consequently, his contention, in response to SOR\nsubparagraph 2.d, that he did not list the 1998 DWI arrest on his security clearance\napplication because he forgot it, is not credible. AG \u00b6 16(a), \u201cdeliberate omission,\nconcealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire,\npersonal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine\nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities,\u201d applies to SOR\nsubparagraph 2.d without mitigation.\nNo conclusive record evidence establishes when Applicant completed his therapy\nthat began in approximately June 2000. Consequently, Applicant\u2019s disclosure of this\ntherapy in response to the corresponding question on the security clearance application\ndoes not trigger the application of AG \u00b6 16(a). Assuming for the sake of argument that\nthe dates he listed were inaccurate by a few months, such an error would be immaterial\ngiven the disclosure of the therapy. I find in Applicant\u2019s favor as to SOR subparagraph\n2.e. \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nDespite Applicant longstanding history of alcohol dependence, he has never fully\napplied himself toward rehabilitation.

Applicant requested a hearing.  On March 31, 2006, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge Martin H. Mogul. granted Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nDepartment Counsel appealed.  After considering the merits of Department Counsel\u2019s appeal, the\nAppeal Board issued a Decision dated March 14, 2007 in which it remanded the case to the Judge\nwith instructions.  The Judge issued a Remand Decision on March 22, 2007.

She received her education, which\nincludes a Ph.D., from U.S. universities.  Her husband, who is not of Persian descent, was born in\nIran.

Applicant indicated that she would be willing to renounce\nher Iranian citizenship.\nB. Discussion\nThe Appeal Board\u2019s review of the Administrative Judge\u2019s findings of fact is limited to\ndetermining if they are supported by substantial record evidence\u2013such relevant evidence as a\nreasonable mind might accept as adequate to support such a conclusion in light of all the contrary\nevidence in the record.  Directive \u00b6 E3. 1.32.1.  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the\nevidence, and the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not\nprevent an administrative agency\u2019s finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d  Consolo\nv. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620-21 (1966).  In evaluating the Administrative\nJudge\u2019s findings, we are required to give deference to the Administrative Judge\u2019s credibility\ndeterminations.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.\nDepartment Counsel has not expressly challenged the Administrative Judge\u2019s factual\nfindings, although she provides a detailed description of facts from the record, upon which her\nappeal brief relies.  Some of this evidence was not included in the Judge\u2019s factual findings.\nInasmuch as Department Counsel\u2019s appeal arguments are couched essentially in terms of objections\nto the Judge\u2019s conclusions, the Board will address the arguments raised on appeal by Department\nCounsel in the context of determining whether the record supports the Judge\u2019s ultimate conclusions.\nIn so doing, the Board will discuss evidence highlighted by Department Counsel in her argument,\nsome of which was not included in the Judge\u2019s factual findings.\nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Ultimate Conclusions\nAn Administrative Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a\nsatisfactory explanation for\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found\nand the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto Ins.\nCo., 463 U.S. 29,43 (1983) (quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168\n(1962)).  The Appeal Board may reverse the Administrative Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or\nrevoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.3. We\nreview matters of law de novo.\nDepartment Counsel asserts that the Judge\u2019s application of Foreign Influence Mitigating\nCondition 1 is unsupported by the evidence and is arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law.\nSpecifically, Department Counsel argues: (a) in view of the record evidence, the Judge\u2019s conclusion\nthat Applicant\u2019s family members are not in a position to be exploited by the government of Iran is\narbitrary and capricious; (b) the Judge failed to consider Applicant\u2019s husband\u2019s ties to his family\nmembers in Iran when evaluating the potential threat of coercion toward Applicant by the presence\nof those family members in Iran; and (c) the Judge did not consider the nature of the Iranian regime\n\nDirective \u00b6 E2.A2.1.2.1.: \u201cAn immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has close ties of\n3\naffection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign country.\u201d \n4\nwhen evaluating Applicant\u2019s vulnerability to exploitation.  Department Counsel\u2019s arguments have\nmerit.\nThe Judge concluded that Foreign Influence Disqualifying Condition 1  applied to the case.\n3\nThe Judge is bound by the Directive.  Under the Directive, once it has been demonstrated that\nApplicant has immediate family members in one or more foreign countries, the burden shifts to\nApplicant to show that the government\u2019s concerns about Applicant\u2019s overseas family are mitigated.\nFor FIMC 1 to apply, Applicant was charged with satisfying the burden of presenting evidence\nsufficient to establish that her family members in Iran are not in a position to be exploited so as to\nforce her to choose between loyalty to those persons and the United States.  The Judge gave four\nreasons for applying FIMC 1: (i) the connection between Applicant\u2019s family in Iran, who have no\ngovernment involvement, and Applicant is minimal and Applicant is not close to them; (ii)\nApplicant\u2019s stated intention not to cooperate with any potential threat to her in-laws in Iran; (iii)\nApplicant was born in the United States and all of her close family members are citizens and\nresidents of the United States; and (iv) her long and successful employment history and her\nsignificant financial interests in the United States.\nAs matter of common sense and human experience, there is a rebuttable presumption that a\nperson has ties of affection for, or obligation to, the immediate family members of the person\u2019s\nspouse.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-03120 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2002).  Department Counsel\npersuasively argues that the record evidence in this case does not establish that Applicant has\novercome this presumption.  As Department Counsel points out, the Judge\u2019s analysis of this aspect\nof the case is flawed in that, when he evaluates the strength of family ties, he focuses only on\nApplicant\u2019s ties to her Iranian in-laws and fails to consider the ties of Applicant\u2019s husband to his\nimmediate family members in Iran.  These latter ties have a direct bearing on the strength of the ties\nof affection and obligation between Applicant and her father-in-law and her siblings-in-law.  The\nrecord evidence establishes that there is genuine affection between Applicant\u2019s husband and his\nfather and his siblings in that they communicate monthly, Applicant\u2019s husband sends his relatives\ngifts,  and Applicant\u2019s parents-in-law have visited Applicant\u2019s husband and their other sons in the\npast on a yearly basis.  The record indicates that Applicant herself has communicated with her in-\nlaws on numerous occasions, either directly or through her husband.  Applicant has also traveled to\nIran three times in the past to visit her Iranian in-laws.  Given the state of the evidence, the\npresumption in favor of close ties of affection or obligation between Applicant and her Iranian in-\nlaws has not been overcome.  There is no evidence of hostility, estrangement, or indifference in the\nrelationship between Applicant and her Iranian in-laws or in the relationship between Applicant\u2019s\nspouse and those same relatives.  Therefore, the Judge\u2019s conclusion that a weakness of ties between\nApplicant and her Iranian in-laws minimizes the likelihood of vulnerability to coercion has no\nsupport in the record. \nThe Judge mentioned Applicant\u2019s stated intention not cooperate with any potential threat to\nher in-laws in Iran as a matter in mitigation.  An applicant\u2019s stated intention about what he or she\nmight do in the future under some hypothetical set of circumstances is merely a statement of\nintention that is not entitled to much weight, unless there is record evidence that the applicant has\nacted in an identical or similar manner in the past under identical or similar circumstances. See, e.g.,\n\n5\nISCR case No. 02-26826 at 5 (App. Bd. Nov. 12, 2003).  Moreover, application of FIMC 1, by its\nown terms, does not hinge on the choice Applicant might make in such a situation.  Rather, the\nconcern is that Applicant not be placed in a situation that could force her to choose between her\nloyalty to foreign in-laws and the United States.  See ISCR Case No. 03-15205 (App. Bd. Jan. 21,\n2005). \nDepartment Counsel is not required to present evidence that Applicant would compromise\nclassified information if the Iranian government made threats against her family members living in\nIran.  The federal government is not required to wait until a hostile foreign country makes threats\nagainst an applicant or the applicant\u2019s immediate family members and then see how the applicant\nreacts or responds to such threats.  Cf. Adams v. Laird, 420 F.2d 230, 238-239 (D.C. Cir.\n1969)(government need not wait until a person mishandles or fails to safeguard classified\ninformation before it can make an adverse security clearance decision), cert. denied, 397 U.S. 1039\n(1970).  All that is required is evidence that Applicant is in a situation that poses a security risk. To\nrequire a stronger showing would result in the untenable situation that the federal government would\nhave to grant access to classified information until or unless there is evidence that an applicant has\nactually failed to protect and safeguard classified information, or until or unless persons in hostile\ncountries are actively engaging in attempts to gain access to classified information from an applicant\nthrough the use of threats and intimidation toward that applicant\u2019s relatives.\nThe Judge lists Applicant\u2019s status as a natural-born United States citizen, the status of her\nclose family members as United States citizens, her long and successful employment history in the\nUnited States and her significant financial interests in the United States as factors in his\ndetermination that her family in Iran does not constitute an unacceptable security risk.  While these\nfactors were relevant evidence that the Judge was entitled to consider, given the record evidence in\nthis case, which includes the potential actions of the government of Iran, a regime that is openly\nhostile to the United States and its interests, Applicant\u2019s ties and history in the United States do not\neliminate the security concerns raised by her family ties in Iran.  Given the nature of the Iranian\ngovernment, Applicant has presented no evidence, and the Judge has articulated no rationale,\nestablishing that her sense of family obligation to relatives living in Iran are diminished by her ties\nto the United States.\nDepartment Counsel asserts that the Judge did not adequately consider the nature of the\nIranian regime when reaching his conclusions in this case.  Notwithstanding the expanded treatment\ngiven the description of the government of Iran in the Judge\u2019s remand decision, Department\nCounsel\u2019s argument has merit.  With this decision the Judge has described the characteristics and\nhistory of the current Iranian regime in more detail.  However, there is little in the way of analysis\nthat relates these factors to Applicant\u2019s situation.  \nAs a matter of common sense and sound risk management under the \u201cclearly consistent with\nthe national interest\u201d standard, an applicant with in-laws to whom they may feel a sense of obligation\nliving in a country hostile to the United States and with a poor human rights record regarding its own\ncitizens should not be granted a security clearance without a very strong showing that those family\nties do not pose a security risk.  Given the undisputed hostility of the Iranian government to the\nUnited States, the fact that Applicant has a father-in-law and two sibling-in-laws living in Iran places\na heavy burden on her to demonstrate she should be granted access to classified information.  In this\n\n6\ncase, the record evidence does not provide the Judge with a rational basis for his conclusion that\nApplicant has met that heavy burden.\nConclusion\n       \nConsidering the record evidence as a whole, Department Counsel has identified a number\nof errors by the Judge which, taken in their entirety, warrant reversal of the Judge\u2019s favorable\nsecurity clearance decision.\nOrder\nThe decision of the Administrative Judge granting Applicant a security clearance is reversed.\n     \nSee Concurring Opinion       \nMichael Y. Ra\u2019anan\nAdministrative Judge\nChairman, Appeal Board\nSigned: Jeffrey D. Billett          \nJeffrey D. Billett\nAdministrative Judge\nMember, Appeal Board\nSee Dissenting Opinion          \nJames E. Moody\nAdministrative Judge\nMember, Appeal Board\nCONCURRING OPINION OF ADMINISTRATIVE JUDGE MICHAEL Y. RA\u2019ANAN\nI concur with the decision to reverse the Judge\u2019s favorable decision.  I write separately to\nclarify an issue arising from my dissent in the first Appeal Board decision in this case.\nIn my dissent, I discussed Applicant\u2019s dual citizenship and the lack of record evidence that\nshe had pursued renunciation of her Iranian citizenship.  As it turned out, my discussion of this\nmatter alerted Applicant to the fact that evidence she had submitted to the Administrative Judge had\n\n7\nnever been admitted into the record.  My earlier discussion of this aspect of the case is no longer\npertinent in light of the correction to the record.\nIn addition to the facts discussed in the majority opinion in the context of  the issue of\nApplicant\u2019s Iranian relatives and in-laws I also note one other problem with the Judge\u2019s favorable\ndecision.  Department Counsel cites case law discussing the fact that family relationships are\ncomplex and involve matters of obligation.  She specifically notes that Applicant\u2019 granddaughter is\nan Iranian citizen.  Applicant\u2019s testimony is plain that the granddaughter\u2019s father is an Iranian,\npossibly living in Iran. (Applicant\u2019s daughter met him in Iran, they married in Iran, and the\ngrandchild was born in Iran).  It seems to me that the parent of one\u2019s grandchild is potentially a\nperson of obligation no less than the in-laws.\n \nSigned: Michael Y. Ra\u2019anan    \nMichael Y. Ra\u2019anan\nAdministrative Judge\nChairman, Appeal Board\nDISSENTING OPINION OF ADMINISTRATIVE JUDGE JAMES E. MOODY\nI respectfully disagree with my colleagues\u2019 decision in this case.  Given the Judge\u2019s\nunchallenged findings, I conclude that a favorable whole person analysis is sustainable on this\nrecord.\nI would note first of all that Applicant is a U.S. citizen, born in this country of parents who\nthemselves are U.S. citizens.  She has two brothers, both of whom are U.S. born citizens as well.\nTherefore, Applicant is in a position different from many others under Guideline B in that she has\nnot become a U.S. citizen only recently, nor has she faced a shifting of national loyalties that might\nbe expected to accompany the naturalization process.  Additionally, her children are U.S. born\ncitizens, and her husband has been a citizen of this country since 1983.  She and her husband hold\nsubstantial assets in the U.S. and none in Iran.  All in all her family history, her immediate family,\nand her financial holdings suggest greater psychological ties to the U.S. than might be found in many\nother cases under this Guideline.  \nI do not believe that Applicant\u2019s security concerns can be mitigated as a matter of law merely\nthrough the application of relevant mitigating conditions.   The presence of in-laws in a hostile\ncountry like Iran would make that a difficult task.  However, a Judge is not limited to Adjudicative\nGuideline mitigating conditions when deciding on whether an applicant has demonstrated\nextenuation or mitigation.  It is obviously permissible for a Judge to conclude that no mitigating\ncondition will per se justify the granting of a clearance yet nevertheless decide in an Applicant\u2019s\nfavor in view of the whole person analysis.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-05110 at n 7 (App. Bd. Mar.\n22, 2004); ISCR Case No. 99-0542 at 7 (App. Bd. Mar. 21, 2003).  In this case the Judge\u2019s findings\nand the record as a whole demonstrate (1) that Applicant has been a U.S. citizen since birth; (2) that\nher parents and brothers are themselves U.S. citizens by birth; (3) that her husband has been a U.S.\n\n8\ncitizen for 24 years; (4) that Applicant\u2019s children are U.S. citizens by birth; (5) that Applicant\u2019s\nfinancial assets, valued at over $2 million, are located in the U.S.; (6) that neither Applicant nor her\nhusband own property in Iran; (7) that Applicant has held a Department of Defense security\nclearance since 1991 without incident or concern; and (8) that Applicant\u2019s direct contact with her\nIranian in-laws is either non-existent or infrequent.  After examining these facts in light of the record,\na reasonable person could conclude that the real probability of Applicant becoming a danger to\nnational security is sufficiently low as to warrant a favorable decision.  I express no opinion as to\nwhether I would have decided in Applicant\u2019s favor had I been the Judge in this case.  However, given\nthe constraints which the Directive imposes upon the Board\u2019s exercise of appellate review, I cannot\nsay that the Judge\u2019s favorable decision under the facts of this case is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary\nto law.  See Directive \u00b6  E3.1.32.3.  See also ISCR Case No. 03-23483 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 29, 2007.)\nFor that reason I would affirm the decision of the Judge.     \nSigned: James E.

Bohn, Esq.\n\n2\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant is a  United States born citizen, and her husband, two children, and other close\nrelatives are also United States citizens.  She has not acted in such a way as to indicate a possible\npreference for a country other than the United States. Applicant  never applied for or received her own\nIranian passport, but her husband did place her name on his passport. While her father-in-law and\nsisters-in-law are citizens and residents of  Iran, a country with interests greatly inimical to the U.S.,\nnone of these family members belong to, participate in, or are active with any government agency of\nIran.  Applicant\u2019s strong attachment to the United States makes it highly unlikely that she would\nrespond favorably to any efforts to act against United States interests.   Mitigation has been shown.\nClearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn September 30,2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 (as amended by Executive Orders 10909, 11328 and 12829) and Department\nof Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992 (as amended by Change 4), issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the\npreliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant. DOHA recommended referral to\nan Administrative Judge to conduct proceedings and determine whether clearance should be granted,\ncontinued, denied or revoked.\nApplicant filed a notarized response, dated November 14, 2005, to the allegations set forth\nin the SOR, and requested a hearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.\nOn December 28, 2005, this case was assigned to this Administrative Judge to conduct a\nhearing and issue a written decision. A Notice of Hearing was issued to the parties on January 5,\n2006, and the hearing was held on January 23, 2006. \nAt the hearing, Department Counsel offered thirteen documentary exhibits (Exhibits 1 through\n13) and no witnesses were called. Applicant offered twenty one documentary exhibits (Exhibit A\nthrough U) at the hearing, and offered her own testimony. \nAll of the documents were entered into evidence without objection. The transcript (Tr) was\nreceived on February 2, 2006. \nThe Government appealed my original decision, which was dated March 31, 2006.  The\nAppeal Board remanded that decision and instructed me to consider all the record evidence, and make\n\u201cmore complete factual findings\u201dprimarily \u201cabout the nature of the Iranian Government.\u201d This has\nbeen done in this remand decision. The remand was assigned to me on March 14, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe SOR contains two allegations, 1.a., and 1.b., under Foreign Preference (Guideline C ) and\n\n3\nsix allegations, 2.a. through 2.f., under Foreign Influence (Guideline B). Applicant admitted SOR\nallegations 2.b. through 2.f. with explanations, and she denied 1.a., 1.b., and 2.a. The admitted\nallegations are incorporated herein as Findings of Fact. \nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including Applicant's\nAnswer to the SOR, the admitted documents and the live testimony, and upon due consideration of\nthat evidence, I make the following additional Findings of Fact: \nApplicant is a 53 year old employee of a defense contractor, and she seeks to retain a DoD\nsecurity clearance in connection with her employment in the defense sector.\nApplicant was born in the United States to United States born parents. She received all of her\neducation, including a Bachelor and Masters of Science, and a Ph. D. degree in Computer\nEngineering, from United States universities. Her husband, whom she married in 1973, is of Turkish\ndescent. He was born in Iran, and became a United States in 1983.  Applicant and her husband have\ntwo children, who were born in the United States and are U. S. Citizens.\nApplicant\u2019s mother and two brothers are also natural born United States citizens, and they\nreside in the United States. Applicant\u2019s father is deceased.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline C - Foreign Preference) \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because\nshe has acted in such a way as to indicate a preference for another country over the United States.\nWhile Applicant  testified that Iran may consider her a citizen of Iran, because she is married to an\nindividual who was a citizen of Iran, she does not consider herself a citizen of Iran. She denied that\nshe had ever taken any affirmative step to be considered an Iranian citizen.\nThe SOR alleges that Applicant applied for an Iranian passport on August 7, 1996, and then\nrenewed her Iranian passport on March 1, 2002, even though she was a United States citizen by birth.\nApplicant denied that she ever applied for or possessed an individual Iranian passport. When she\ntraveled to Iran with her husband, the names of Applicant and her daughters were added to his\npassport, and that was what was used to enter and exit Iran. \nWhen Applicant\u2019s husband became aware that his Iranian passport was an issue of security\nconcern and significance for Applicant, he tore it up and discarded it.\nApplicant indicated that she would be willing to renounce her Iranian citizenship, even though\nshe does not consider herself an Iranian citizen.\nParagraph 2 (Guideline B - Foreign Influence) \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because\nshe has immediate family members or people to whom she may be bound by affection or obligation\nwho are not citizens of the United States, or may be subject to duress. \n\n4\nThe first allegation in this paragraph is that Applicant has a son-in-law, who is an Iranian\ncitizen, residing in India. Applicant denied this allegation, since her daughter is now divorced from\nthis individual, who resides in either Iran or Germany, and neither she nor her daughter have any\ncontact with him. \nApplicant\u2019s niece, a citizen of Iran, resided with Applicant in the United States from 1999 to\n2001. She no longer resides with Applicant, but she does reside in the United States. She is in the\nprocess of becoming a United States citizen, and she plans to remain in this country.\nApplicant has a father-in-law, who is a citizen and resident of  Iran. He also has permanent\nresidency status in the United States. He owns a private company, not associated with the Iranian\nGovernment. She maintains no contact with him, and she last spoke to him in 2002.   Her father-in-\nlaw did visit the United States in 2005, but she neither saw him,  nor spoke to him when he was here.\nApplicant\u2019s husband has three sisters ands one brother. Applicant\u2019s brother-in-law is now a\nUnited States citizen residing in the United States with his wife and children. One sister-in-law\nresides in the United States and is the process of becoming a United States citizen. Her husband is\na  United States citizen. Applicant\u2019s  other two sisters-in-law both reside in Iran and Germany.\nNeither they nor their spouses work for the Iranian Government.  Applicant  maintains no regular\ncontact with any of her relatives in Iran. \nApplicant traveled to Iran in 1998, 1999, and 2002.  The first visit was to visit her father-in-\nlaw and to honor her mother-in-law who had died one year previously. The trip in 1999 was for a\nceremony of her daughter, who was marrying an Iranian man, whom she had met during their 1998\ntrip. The final trip was to see her grandchild who had been born in Iran. During all of her trips to Iran\nshe complied with all the security regulations of her employer. Now that all of Applicant\u2019s  immediate\nfamily is in the United States and she is aware of the security concerns, it is her intention to never\nreturn to Iran.\nApplicant had also lived in Iran with her husband from 1976 to 1979, while he fulfilled his\nservice obligation to the country by teaching at a university. She also worked as a teacher while they\nwere in Iran.   \nNeither Applicant nor her husband own any property or other assets or stand to inherit any\nassets in Iran. They have a home which they value at $2 million and other significant assets in this\ncountry. \nCurrent Status of Iran\nIn writing my initial decision, I considered all of the evidence presented in the case regarding\nthe current status of Iran, and how it may affect Applicant. In my decision I wrote that because, \u201cIran,\n[is] a country which is undisputedly hostile to the Government of the United States, Applicant has\na very heavy burden of showing that these family members do not pose a security risk.\u201d This remand\ndecision will discuss in more detail the current nature and extent of the Iranian Government,\nespecially as it relates to the United States. \nCurrently, Iran is considered one of the most dangerous adversaries to the interests of the\n\n5\nUnited States. The U.S. has not had diplomatic relations with Iran since April 7, 1980, following the\nNovember 1979 Iranian student occupation of the American Embassy in Tehran and the hostage\ntaking of 52 Americans, which was supported by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, Iran\u2019s leader at the\ntime.\nThe United States Government\u2019s concerns with Iran\u2019s policies include, but are not limited to\nthe following: (1) its clandestine efforts to acquire nuclear weapons of mass destruction, (2) its\nsponsorship of international terrorism, (3) its intervention into the internal affairs of Iraq, (4) its\naggressive efforts to undermine the Middle East peace process, and (5) its human rights violation\nagainst its own people. As a result of these concerns, the U.S. prohibits most trade with Iran.\n \nPOLICIES\nThe adjudication process is based on the whole person concept. All available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, is to be taken into account\nin reaching a decision as to whether a person is an acceptable security risk. Enclosure 2 to the\nDirective sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be carefully considered according to the\npertinent criterion in making the overall common sense determination required. Each adjudicative\ndecision must also include an assessment of the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct and\nsurrounding circumstances; the frequency and recency of the conduct; the individual's age and\nmaturity at the time of the conduct; the motivation of the individual applicant and extent to which the\nconduct was negligent, willful, voluntary or undertaken with knowledge of the consequences\ninvolved; the absence or presence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; the\npotential for coercion, exploitation and duress; and the probability that the circumstances or conduct\nwill continue or recur in the future. See Directive 5220.6, Section 6.3 and Enclosure 2, Section E2.2.\nBecause each security case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be\nassumed that the factors exhaust the realm of human experience or that the factors apply equally in\nevery case. Moreover, although adverse information concerning a single criterion may not be\nsufficient for an unfavorable determination, the individual may be disqualified if available\ninformation reflects a recent or recurring pattern of questionable judgment, irresponsibility or\nemotionally unstable behavior. See Directive 5220.6, Enclosure 2, Section E2.2.4. \nUnder the provisions of Executive Order 10865 as amended and the Directive, a decision to\ngrant or continue an applicant's clearance may be made only upon an affirmative finding that to do\nso is clearly consistent with the national interest. In reaching the fair and impartial overall common\nsense determination required, the Administrative Judge can only draw those inferences and\nconclusions which have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record. In addition, as the\ntrier of fact, the Administrative Judge must make critical judgments as to the credibility of witnesses.\nDecisions under the Directive include consideration of the potential as well as the actual risk that an\napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to properly safeguard classified information.\nBurden of Proof\nInitially, the Government has the burden of proving any controverted fact(s) alleged in the\nStatement of Reasons. If the Government meets its burden and establishes conduct cognizable as a\nsecurity concern under the Directive, the burden of persuasion then shifts to the applicant to present\nevidence in refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the existence\n\n6\nof criterion conduct, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with\nthe Government predicated upon trust and confidence. Where the facts proven by the Government\nraise doubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy\nburden of persuasion to demonstrate that he is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the United\nStates Supreme Court in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988), \"the clearly\nconsistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the\nside of denials.\" Any doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with\nnational security will be resolved in favor of the national security. See Enclosure 2 to the Directive,\nSection E2.2.2.\nCONCLUSIONS\nHaving considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal precepts and factors,\nand having assessed the credibility of those who testified, I conclude the following with respect to\nguidelines C and B:\n(Guideline C - Foreign Preference) \nGuideline C is based on actions taken by an individual that indicate a preference for a foreign\ncountry over the United States. Applicant argues credibly that she never took any affirmative action\nto be considered an Iranian citizen and therefore, she does not consider herself an Iranian citizen.  She\nnever applied for or possessed her own Iranian passport.  Her husband, who already possessed an\nIranian passport, added the names of Applicant and their daughters to his passport. Her husband has\ndestroyed his Iranian passport, and neither of them has any intention of traveling to Iran again. \nIn reviewing the Disqualifying Conditions (DC) under Guideline C,  I do not find that any\napplies because Applicant never acted in such a way as to indicate a preference for Iran over the\nUnited States.   She never applied for or possessed her own Iranian passport, nor took any other steps\nto assert an Iranian or dual citizenship.  Mitigating Condition (MC) (E2.A3.1.3.4.), a stated\nwillingness to renounce dual citizenship, could be argued to apply, although Applicant does not\nconsider herself an Iranian citizen. I resolve Paragraph 1, Guideline C for Applicant.  \n(Guideline B - Foreign Influence) \nUnder Guideline B, a security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including\ncohabitants, and other persons to whom he is bound by affection, influence or obligation, are not\ncitizens of the United States or may be subject to duress. Based on the evidence of record, the\nGovernment has established an initial reason to deny Applicant a security clearance because of\nforeign influence. As Applicant\u2019s in-laws are citizen and resident of Iran, a country which is\nundisputedly hostile to the Government of the United States, Applicant has a very heavy burden of\nshowing that these family members do not pose a security risk. ISCR Case No. 01-26893 (October\n16, 2002). \n\n7\nThe Iranian citizenship of members of Applicant's immediate family create the potential for\nforeign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information because it makes\nApplicant potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure. The possession of such ties\nraises a security concern sufficient to require Applicant to present evidence in rebuttal, extenuation,\nor mitigation sufficient to meet his burden of persuasion that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for him. ISCR Case No. 99-0424, 2001 (App. Bd.\nFeb. 8, 2001). This Applicant has done.\nThe evidence of existence of Applicant\u2019s father-in-law and sisters-in-law, who are citizens\nand residents of Iran, comes within DC (E2.A2.1.2.1.), an immediate family member, or a person to\nwhom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in,\na foreign country. \nAs stated above, I have considered the country involved in this case in making my original\ndecision and in this remand. Iran, with an interest greatly inimical to the United States, must be\nscrutinized in great detail. However, the connection between Applicant\u2019s family in that country and\nApplicant is minimal. As discussed above, Applicant\u2019s only relatives in Iran are her father-in-law and\nher two sisters-in-law, both of whom reside part time in Germany. Applicant\u2019s contact with all three\nis extremely limited, as she  never communicates with any of them by telephone, and she last saw\nthem  in 2002. What is extremely telling, as to a lack of closeness between Applicant and her father-\nin-law, is that when her father-in-law visited the United States in 2005, she neither saw nor spoke to\nhim. While I certainly considered in my original decision and continue to understand that Iran, which\nengages in human rights violations, could potentially place threats against Applicant\u2019s father-in-law\nin an attempt to coerce Applicant, the evidence strongly suggests that no such threat would  cause\nApplicant to act in a way that would be contrary to the interest of the United States.\nThe primary factors in mitigation that I have considered include the following: Applicant was\nborn in the United States to United States citizens; all of her close family members, including her\nhusband, her two daughters, her granddaughter, her mother, and her two brothers are citizens and\nresidents of  the United States; she has had minimal contacts and closeness with her in-laws in Iran,\nwho have no Iranian government involvement; her long and successful employment history in the\nUnited States; her significant financial interests in the  United States; and her stated intention not to\ncooperate with any potential threat to her in-laws in Iran.  \nBased on the nature of the overall record and the totality of the evidence,  I have determined\nthat her family in Iran does not constitute an unacceptable security risk, and Mitigating Condition\n(MC) E2.A2.1.3.1, \u201ca determination that the immediate family member(s) . . . in question are not\nagents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force\nthe individual to choose between loyalty to the person(s) involved and the United States,\u201d applies. \nAfter considering all of the evidence of record on the issue of Foreign Influence, I resolve\nParagraph 2, Guideline B for Applicant.  \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings as required by Section 3. Paragraph 7 of Enclosure 1 to the Directive are\n\n8\nhereby rendered as follows:\nParagraph 1. Guideline C: FOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1. a.: \nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.: \nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2.

He has \nworked for his current employer for almost 30 years. Applicant is married with one child \nand three step-children. He has an associate of arts degree. He served in the U.S. Navy \nfrom 1976 until 1980. Id. During his military career, he served aboard an aircraft carrier \nand worked with an aviation rating. He held a top secret clearance. After his discharge \nfrom active duty, he served in the Reserves (Tr. 22). \n \n \nApplicant started drinking alcohol while in the Navy. In April 1986, Applicant was \narrested and charged with (1) driving under the influence of alcohol, (2) blood alcohol \nlevel of .10 or above, and (3) unlicensed driver. He pled guilty to the first charge. \nApplicant was sentenced to attend 12 weeks of intensive alcohol information school. He \nwas given a 90 day restriction on his driver\u2019s license, received 36 months probation, and \nordered to pay a fine of $750. He admits consuming alcohol, at times to the point of \nintoxication, from 1986 to at least September 2005 (Tr. 24). \n \n \nApplicant was arrested on March 24, 1992. He was charged with (1) driving while \nintoxicated (DWI) and (2) driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI). He pled not guilty \nto count (1). The court found Applicant guilty on count (2). He was granted probation \nbefore judgment for one year and fined $250 plus court costs of $20. \n \n \nApplicant has worked for his current employer, as noted above, since 1980. In \n1997, Applicant received counseling for having alcohol on his breath at work. He is \ndiabetic (requires insulin) and maintains that the odor was not alcohol but due to high \nblood sugar level it may smell like alcohol. He further states that the only time he \nreceived any negative notice at work was when he worked under a certain supervisor \nwith whom he had a conflict (Tr. 34-35).  \n \nIn January 1997, Applicant received an unsatisfactory evaluation from the same \nsupervisor. He was cited for excessive absenteeism. Applicant had medical problems at \nthe time. He had an angiogram and a stent put in his heart. In September 1997, he was \ngiven a work performance counseling for wandering off the job. Applicant admitted to \nthe allegations in the SOR, but he explained at the hearing that he could not remember \nthe circumstances. He was adamant that they were all given by the same supervisor \nwith whom he had a personality conflict. He also stated the March 4, 1998 disciplinary \ncounseling for failure to follow directions was also without merit (Tr. 40-43).     \n \nOn January 13, 1999, Applicant received a citation from work for a security \nviolation. He does not know the reason for this violation. He was not working on \n\n \n3 \n                                      \n \nanything secret or top secret at the time. He went to security and asked about this \nviolation. He wanted to see his record. He was told there is no record of the violation \n(Tr. 48). \n \n \nOn August 4, 2003, Applicant received a final written warning about personal use \nof the internet on a government computer. He checked his emails during lunch time. He \nreceived spam and the company told him not to check personal email again (Tr. 49). \n \n \nApplicant was never court ordered to alcohol counseling, nor does he have any \ndiagnosis of alcohol abuse or dependence. He does not go out at night very much due \nto his medical conditions. He had a stroke in 2004. He does not go to bars anymore \nbecause he can no longer play darts and this was a form of entertainment to him. He \nwon various titles for dart competition (Tr. 23). \n \n \nApplicant currently drinks at home in the evening from approximately 5:00 p.m. \nuntil 11:00. He consumes four or five drinks. He will have two cocktails before dinner \nand then maybe two or three drinks before he retires for the evening. He explained he \nmay have one drink per hour before he goes to bed. He reports that he does not put \nhimself in any situations with drinking (such as driving) that would jeopardize him (Tr. \n57). \n \n \n  Applicant enjoys his current position and is very committed to its success. He is \na well respected employee and a valued member of the team. He maintains a \nprofessional appearance and sets a good example to the other staff. He displays a high \ndegree of proficiency and professionalism in his work.  He has been acknowledged for \nhis innovation, expertise and support by his peer, the company and its customers (AE \nA-C). He has excellent rapport with his customers and his work exceeds expectations. \nHis most recent Performance Appraisals (2005-7) rate him as outstanding (AE D). He \nreceived a prestigious award from the company in 2007. He is highly recommended for \na security clearance by his employer.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on \nnational security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to \noccupy a position \u2026 that will give that person access to such information.\u201d Department \nof the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 527 (1988).  In Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information Within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), the President set \nout guidelines and procedures for safeguarding classified information and determining \ntrustworthiness within the executive branch.  \n \n \nTo be eligible for a security clearance or access to sensitive information, an \napplicant must meet the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  Enclosure 2 of \nthe Directive sets forth Adjudicative Guidelines which must be considered in the \nevaluation of security suitability. Paragraph E2.2., Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth \npotentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each \nguideline. Additionally, each security decision must be a fair and impartial \n\n \n4 \n                                      \n \ncommonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and circumstances, \nand the whole-person concept. \n \n \nThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life \nto make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.\u201d   \nAn administrative judge must apply the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d and consider and \ncarefully weigh the available, reliable information about the person.  An administrative \njudge should consider the following factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of \nthe conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and \nmaturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the \npresence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n   \n         Initially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in \nthe SOR that disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to \nclassified information. Directive Enclosure 3, Paragraph E3.1.14. Thereafter, the \napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate \nthe facts. Directive, Enclosure 3, Paragraph E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate \nburden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or \ncontinue his security clearance.\u201d Any doubt as to whether access to classified \ninformation is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the \nnational security. Directive, Enclosure 2, E2.2.2.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate adjudicative factors, I conclude the following with respect to the allegations \nset forth in the SOR: \n  \nGuideline G (Alcohol Consumption) The Concern; Excessive alcohol consumption \noften leads to the exercise of questionable judgment, unreliability, failure to control \nimpulses, and can increases the risk of unauthorized disclosure of classified information \ndue to carelessness. \n \n \n \nIn this matter, the government provided substantial evidence that Applicant was \narrested in 1986 and 1992 for alcohol related driving incidents. Consequently, Alcohol \nConsumption Disqualifying Condition (AC DC) E2.A7.1.2.1 (\u201calcohol-related incidents \naway from work, such as driving under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, \ndisturbing the peace, or other criminal incidents related to alcohol use\u201d) applies. \nApplicant admitted that he consumed alcohol, at times to excess and to the point of \nintoxication, from 1986 to at least 2005. Thus, AC DC E2.A7.1.2.5 (\u201chabitual or binge \nconsumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment\u201d) applies. \n \n \nWith the government\u2019s case established, the burden shifts to Applicant to present \nevidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against him. I \n\n \n5 \n                                      \n \nconsidered the Alcohol Consumption Mitigating Condition (AC MC) E2.A7.1.3.1 (\u201cthe \nalcohol-related incidents do not indicate a pattern\u201d) and (AC MC) E2.A7.1.3.2 (the \nproblem occurred a number of years ago and there is no indication of a recent \nproblem\u201d). There are no \u201cbright line\u201d rules for determining when conduct is \u201crecent.\u201d The \ndetermination must be based on \u201ca careful evaluation of the totality of the record within \nthe parameters set by the directive. ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd.  Aug. 4, \n2004). If the evidence shows \u201ca significant period of time has passed without any \nevidence of misconduct,\u201d then an administrative judge must determine whether that \nperiod of time demonstrates \u201cchanged circumstances or conduct sufficient to warrant a \nfinding of reform or rehabilitation.\u201d Id. AC MC 1 and 2 have some applicability in this \ncase. Applicant was found guilty of DUI in 1986. He did not have any alcohol driving \nincidents again until 1992 when he was leaving a party. He was given a Probation \nBefore Judgment and successfully completed probation. Thus, the last alcohol driving \nincident was sixteen years ago. He has changed his drinking habits and does not drink \nand drive. He has no problems at work directly related to alcohol consumption and has \nreceived outstanding evaluations. His past conduct does not cast doubt on his current \nreliability, trustworthiness or good judgment. The whole person analysis, infra, provides \nadditional discussion of mitigating circumstances \n \nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) The Concern; Conduct involving questionable \njudgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations could indicate that the person may not properly \nsafeguard classified information.  \n \n \nPersonal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) E2.A.5.1.2.1 (\u201creliable, \nunfavorable information provided by associates, employers, coworkers, neighbors, and \nother acquaintances\u201d), and PC DC E2.A5.1.2.5 (\u201ca pattern of dishonesty or rule \nviolations, including violation of any written or recorded agreement made between the \nindividual and the agency\u201d) apply. During the period in 1997 and 1999, Applicant had \nseveral counseling actions at work for absenteeism and alcohol on his breath. He also \nhad a warning in 2003 concerning his personal use of the computer. He has more than \n30 years with his employer.  \n \n \nPersonal Conduct Mitigating Condition (PC MC) E2.A5.1.3.1. (\u201cthe information \nwas unsubstantiated or not pertinent to a determination of judgment, trustworthiness, or \nreliability\u201d) applies. The SOR was completed in 2005. Initially, Applicant admitted to all \nthe allegations and did not want a hearing. When he testified at the hearing, he had \nexplanations for the various incidents. He tried to find a record on the security violation \nand was told that there was none. I find under these circumstances that this mitigating \ncondition applies to SOR 2.f. Also, the incidents are distant in time, and Applicant has \nperformed in an outstanding manner since then. E2.A5.1.3.5 (\u201cthe individual has taken \npositive steps to significantly reduce or eliminate vulnerability to coercion, exploitation or \nduress\u201d) applies. \n \n \n \n \n  \n\n \n6 \n                                      \n \nWhole Person \n \n \nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount \nconcern. The objective of the clearance determination process is the fair-minded, \ncommonsense assessment of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that \nthe person is eligible for a clearance. Indeed, the adjudicative process is a careful \nweighing of a number of variables in considering the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept. It \nrecognizes that we should view a person by the totality of their acts, omissions, \nmotivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking \ninto consideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature \nthinking, and careful analysis. \n \n \n \nApplicant was candid in his demeanor and testimony at the hearing. He \nacknowledged that he did not want a hearing initially, and did not understand the \nprocess. He was forthright in acknowledging that he filled out his SF 86 a long time ago \nand the incidents are ten years ago. He has received outstanding evaluations. The \nincidents have been documented for twenty years and he does not understand why this \nis an issue now.  \n \n \nHe has completed his alcohol probation and does not have an alcohol-related \ndiagnosis. He does not drink and drive. He is no longer going out to bars to drink. He \nhas a clearance and enjoys his work. He has letters of appreciation and commendations \nover the years. Despite his prior two alcohol-related incidents, he continued to perform \nin his work.  He never mishandled classified information and continued to work on a \nregular basis. His circumstances have changed due to his medical condition and his life \nis devoted to work. He works long hours and lives a quiet life. Although he admits that \nhe still drinks alcohol every evening at home, he is adamant that he does not drink and \ndrive.  He has no incidents or absences at work. His past three year evaluations are \noutstanding. His employers praise his commitment and accomplishments. \n \n \nI have considered all the evidence and the \u201cwhole person\u201d in evaluating \nApplicant\u2019s security clearance determination. Applicant has mitigated the government\u2019s \nconcern pertaining to his alcohol consumption and his personal conduct. \n. \nFORMAL FINDINGS \n \n \nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 1.

Howry Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Martha D. Henderson, Esquire\nSeptember 25, 2008\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMOGUL, Martin H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on July 7, 2003.\nOn April 9, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guidelines C and B\nfor Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant replied to the SOR (RSOR) in writing on May 22, 2008, and requested\na hearing before an Administrative Judge. I received the case assignment on July 11,\n2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on August  4, 2008, and I convened the hearing\nas scheduled on August 27, 2008. The Government offered Exhibits 1 through 8, which\nwere received with some objection to the documents used regarding Taiwan. Applicant\ntestified on his own behalf and had two additional witnesses testify. Through counsel,\nhe also submitted Exhibits A through O, which were received without objection. DOHA\n\n2\nreceived the transcript of the hearing (Tr) on September 12, 2008. Based upon a review\nof the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is granted.\nRequest for Administrative Notice\nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice\nof certain facts relating to the country of Taiwan. The request and the attached\ndocuments were admitted into evidence as Exhibit 8. The facts administratively noticed\nare set out in the Findings of Fact, below. \nFindings of Fact\nIn his RSOR, Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations 1.a. through e., and\n2.a., through f., with explanations. The admitted allegations are incorporated herein as\nfindings of fact. \nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including\nApplicant's RSOR, the admitted documents, the testimony of Applicant and the other\nwitnesses, and upon due consideration of that evidence, I make the additional findings\nof fact: \nApplicant was born in Taiwan in 1953. He moved to the United States in 1977,\nand he has lived in the U.S. since that time, with the exception of a three month period\nin 2000.  He had received a Bachelor of Science Degree in Chemical Engineering in\nTaiwan, and he came to the U.S. to pursue higher education in engineering and\nscience. He received a Master of Science degree in Chemical Engineering from a U.S.\nuniversity in 1979, and a Ph.D. degree from another U.S. university in Material Science\nand Engineering. \nHe became a naturalized United States citizen in 1988.  Applicant is married, and\nhis wife, who was also born in Taiwan, came to the United States in 2003, and became\na United States citizen in 2007. Applicant and his wife have a five year old daughter.\nApplicant\u2019s parents are deceased. His brother is a U.S. citizen and resident, and\nhis sister is permanent resident of the U.S.\nApplicant is employed as a research scientist by a defense contractor, and he\nseeks a DoD security clearance in connection with his employment in the defense\nsector.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline C - Foreign Preference) \n1.a. It is alleged in the SOR that Applicant exercised dual citizenship with Taiwan\nand the United States. Applicant contends that his only exercise of Taiwanese\ncitizenship was to enter and exit Taiwan between 1998 and 2002 with a passport from\nTaiwan.  Applicant began using his Taiwanese passport after he learned that he could\n\n3\nnot stay in Taiwan longer than 60 days without leaving and traveling to Hong Kong to\nget an extension. He has not used his Taiwanese passport since 2003.  Applicant does\nnot consider himself to be a dual citizen of Taiwan and the United States, but only a\nU.S. citizen. Other than using his Taiwanese passport, he has not engaged in any of the\nresponsibilities or duties, or received any privileges, from being a Taiwanese citizen. \n1.b. As of October 9, 2007, Applicant continued to possess a Taiwanese\npassport that was issued on January 2, 2003.  His Taiwan passport is not scheduled to\nexpire until January 2, 2013. At the hearing, Applicant testified that he has renounced\nhis Taiwanese citizenship and revoked his passport from Taiwan. Applicant submitted a\nCertificate of Renunciation of Nationality, dated June 4, 2008, from the Minister of the\nInterior, indicating that Applicant\u2019s renunciation of his Taiwanese citizenship has been\naccepted (Exhibit O).  Applicant testified that at the same time that he applied for the\ncitizenship renunciation, he also included his Taiwanese passport. At the hearing he\nsubmitted the passport to me, explaining and showing me that a corner of the passport\nhad been cut off and it had been invalidated by the Taiwanese government.  \n1.c.  Applicant applied for and was issued a Taiwanese  passport, even though\nhe had become a United States citizen in 1988, and held a valid United States passport\nsince 1988. As discussed above, Applicant only did this so that he could stay in Taiwan\nfor longer than 60 days, without having to leave the country to receive an extension to\nstay longer. \n1.d.  Applicant used his Taiwanese passport in lieu of his U.S. passport to enter\nand exit Taiwan until 2003, when his supervisor suggested to him that, since he was\nbeing considered for a security clearance, he should use only his U.S. passport. When\nApplicant learned that using his Taiwanese passport might be considered showing a\npreference for a country other than the United States, he stopped using it, and he has\nnow renounced his Taiwanese citizenship and had his Taiwanese passport invalidated. \n1.e.  Applicant used his Taiwanese passport for travel to the People\u2019s Republic of\nChina (PRC) in 2000, and he had retained the travel document that was issued by the\nPRC government to citizens of Taiwan for travel in the PRC. Applicant testified that he\ntook two trips to the PRC when he worked for a Taiwanese company, to visit the\ncompany\u2019s plant in the PRC. This employment will be discussed in more detail under\nparagraphs 2.d. and 2.e., below. Applicant only kept the document because there was\nno requirement to return it. Exhibit E is a copy of this travel document with the first page\ntranslated, showing that the document expired in October 2005. Applicant has not\ntraveled back to the PRC since 2000.\n\n4\nParagraph 2 (Guideline B - Foreign Influence) \n2.a. Applicant's mother-in-law is a citizen and resident of Taiwan. She visits\nApplicant and his wife, usually two times a year for three months at a time. She is 64\nyears old and is retired as a golf shop manager. She has recently received approval to\nreceive an immigration visa from the U.S. When she receives it, she plans to move to\nthe U..S. and to live with Applicant and his wife. \n2.b. Applicant has one brother-in-law who is a citizen and resident of Taiwan. He\nis an officer in the Immigration Administration of the Interior Ministry of Taiwan.\nApplicant testified that his job is to check people\u2019s passports as they enter Taiwan.\nWhen Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law is staying with them, his brother-in-law calls\napproximately once a week, and when she is not in the U.S., he calls once a month.\nApplicant does not always speak to him when he calls. \n2.c. Applicant has a second brother-in-law who is a citizen and resident of\nTaiwan. He is a chemical engineer for a private company in Taiwan. Applicant does see\nboth brothers-in-law when he travels to Taiwan.  \n2.d. Applicant resided in Taiwan from September 2000 to November 2000, and\nhe was employed by a Taiwanese company that was owned by Applicant\u2019s friend, who\nis a citizen and resident of Taiwan. The company, for which he worked as a consultant,\nmanufactured the material that was attached to cooking utensils to make them non-\nstick. Applicant\u2019s friend asked Applicant if he could come to Taiwan and help him with\nhis business. Since Applicant\u2019s business in the U.S. was slow, he went for three\nmonths.  Applicant has not worked for this company since 2000. His contact with this\nfriend, who is not associated with the Taiwanese government, is infrequent. \n2.e. Applicant traveled to the PRC in 2000 for site visits for the Taiwanese\ncompany, reviewed on 2.d., above. He visited the PRC on two occasions in 2000 and\nhas not returned since that year. \n2.f.  Applicant traveled to Taiwan in the following years: 1998, and 2000 through\n2007. His visits were for both personal and business reasons, including traveling while\nworking for U.S. companies, attending the funeral of his mother, courting and marrying\nhis wife, and the consulting work that has been discussed above.  \nApplicant owns a home in the United States, and he also has retirement\naccounts and other assets worth several hundred thousand dollars in the U.S. He owns\nno assets in Taiwan or any other country but the U.S.  Since he became a U.S. citizen,\nhe has voted in almost every election for which he had an opportunity. He also testified\nabout his very strong feeling that the U.S. is his country, and he plans to remain here for\nthe rest of his life. \nTwo witnesses testified on behalf of Applicant. The first is the director of a\ndepartment and has been Applicant\u2019s supervisor since 2003. He described Applicant as\na high quality worker, who is mature, hard working, and \u201ccompletely trustworthy.\u201d This\n\n5\nwitness also wrote a very positive character letter regarding Applicant (Exhibit H).  The\nsecond witness first became associated with Applicant in 1984, when they were both\ngraduate students at a U.S. university. They have now worked together at the same\nemployer for four or five years.  This witness extolled Applicant\u2019s virtues as \u201cextremely\nhard working, of great integrity and does what is right for the program and the project.\u201d\nAdditionally this witness wrote a very positive character letter regarding Applicant\n(Exhibit I). \nFinally, Applicant submitted two additional strong character letters, which were\nvery positive on his behalf (Exhibits J and K), a Commendation letter (Exhibit L), and an\nEmployee Spot Award for his contributions to the company (Exhibit M). \nCurrent Status of Taiwan \nI take administrative notice of the following facts regarding Taiwan. Taiwan has\nan elected democratic government. It has the 17  largest economy that is a leading\nth\nproducer of high-technology goods. It engages in industrial and economic espionage.\nProprietary information technology is high on the Taiwanese list of targeted information\nto be acquired by their agents from foreign governments and businesses. \nThere are 23 million Taiwanese citizens. Their per capita income in 2005 was\n$15,000, cited by their president in a speech that he presented as economic progress\nunder his administration. Although the United States now recognizes Taiwan as part of\nthe People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) as \u201cone-China\u201d it continues to maintain strong\nunofficial relations with Taiwan.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\n\n6\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline C, Foreign Preference\nUnder AG \u00b6 9 the security concern involving foreign preference arises, \u201c[W]hen\nan individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over\nthe United States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or make\ndecisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s application and receipt of an Taiwanese passport raises foreign\npreference concerns under Disqualifying Condition DC 10 (a), the exercise of the\nprivilege of foreign citizenship.\nHowever, Applicant did invalidate his foreign passport, by turning it over to a\nTaiwanese government representative, so that it could be cut and invalidated.\nAdditionally, he renounced his Taiwanese citizenship to the proper Taiwan authorities\nand received confirmation that his renunciation of his Taiwanese citizenship has been\naccepted. Therefore, I find that Mitigating Conditions (MC) 11. (b) and (e) under this\nguideline apply to this case. After considering all of the evidence of record under\nGuideline C, I conclude that the mitigating evidence substantially outweighs the\ndisqualifying evidence. \n\n7\nGuideline B, Foreign Influence\n4\nAG \u00b6 6 expresses the security concern regarding foreign influence:\nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a\nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by\nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or\nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such\nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a\nrisk of terrorism.\nAG \u00b6 7 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying (DC). Those that could be applicable in this case include the following: (a)\ncontact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate, friend, or\nother person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a\nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;\n(d) sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship status, if\nthat relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation,\npressure, or coercion. Applicant\u2019s relatives, including his mother-in-law, and brothers-in-\nlaw, who are citizens and residents of Taiwan, make DC 7. (a) and (d) a concern to the\nGovernment.\nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns (MC):\n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of loyalty\nor obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is so minimal, or the\nindividual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that\nthe individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S.\ninterest. \nI find that MC (b) is applicable to this Applicant and strongly controlling for the\nfollowing reasons: Applicant, who is 55 years old, immigrated to the United States when\nhe was 24 and has lived in the U.S. for 31 years, more than half of his life. He has been\na U.S. citizen for 20 years, and he is married to a naturalized U.S. citizen. They have a\nsix year old daughter, who is a U. S. citizen. His brother is a U.S. citizen and resident,\nand his sister is permanent resident of the U.S. Applicant received two college degrees\nin the U.S., and has worked here his entire adult life, with the exception of three months\nin 2000, when he worked in Taiwan. Applicant has considerable assets in the U.S. and\nnone in Taiwan or any other country.   \nApplicant  has taken the formal step of renouncing his Taiwanese citizenship. He\nhas also had his Taiwanese passport invalidated. His contact with brothers-in-law is\nlimited, and his mother-in-law plans to move to the United States shortly. Finally,\n\n8\nextremely positive testimony was offered on behalf of Applicant, and he had also\nreceived many laudatory recommendations from individuals in character letters. Based\non all of this mitigating evidence, I conclude Guideline B for Applicant.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2 (c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.      \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Based on all of the reasons cited\nabove as to why the Mitigating Conditions apply under Guidelines C and B, I find that\nthe record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility\nand suitability for a security clearance under the whole person concept. For all these\nreasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline C:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline B:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.d:\nFor Applicant\n\n9\nSubparagraph 2.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.f:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

However, the record did not establish\nthat Applicant was potentially vulnerable to foreign influence. Clearance denied.\n\nRequired by Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, as amended (Directive).\n1\n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nApplicant challenges the 29 September 2005 Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n(DOHA) Statement of Reasons (SOR) recommending denial or revocation of his clearance because\nof foreign influence, security violations, and personal conduct.  Applicant answered the SOR 29\n1\nOctober 2005 and requested a hearing. DOHA assigned the case to me 20 March 2006, and I\nconvened a hearing 4 May 2006. DOHA received the transcript 17 May 2006.\n \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant denied the SOR allegations, except for admitting foreign travel to Hong Kong and\nthe People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC)(SOR 1.c. and 1.d.). He is a 46-year-old software engineer,\nemployed by a defense contractor. He seeks reinstatement of the security clearance he previously\nheld between October 1996 and October 2000, when he was terminated from his employment for\ncause.\nApplicant\u2014an ethnic Chinese\u2014was born in Hong Kong in 1960, making him a citizen of\nthe United Kingdom. He grew up in Hong Kong and was educated there. He immigrated to Canada\nin 1981, and to the U.S. in 1983.  His parents also immigrated to the U.S. His father was a chef. His\nmother was a housewife. Applicant became a naturalized citizen in October 1995. His parents also\nbecame naturalized U.S. citizens; mother in June 1996, father in August 1996. On 1 July 1997, the\nUnited Kingdom lease on the British Crown Colony of Hong Kong expired and dominion, control,\nand the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong reverted to the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC).\nHong Kong will remain a Special Administrative Region (SAR) of the PRC, retaining a high degree\nof autonomy in all matters except foreign relations and defense, until 2047.\nApplicant maintains minimal contact with Hong Kong. He remains in contact with a high\nschool math teacher. They exchange emails about twice a year, and may meet for a meal whenever\nApplicant is in Hong Kong. Between 1998 and 2003, Applicant exchanged frequent emails with an\nelectronic pen pal he met on a Hong Kong website. He met her briefly on one of his trips back to\nHong Kong in December 1998. She married in 2003, and the frequency of their emails diminished\nuntil it stopped altogether. While Applicant\u2019s mother was alive, Applicant spoke monthly by\ntelephone to a cousin who lived in the PRC. The conversations were largely about his mother and\nher health, and stopped after she died in June 2005. Until his mother died, Applicant\u2019s parents\nresided in Hong Kong for 2-3 months per year, usually in summer. They lived in a rented apartment.\nHowever, Applicant\u2019s father is now 73, and his health prevents him from traveling to Hong Kong\nalone. The lease on the apartment expired in March 2006 and his father did not renew it. He lives\nmost of the year with Applicant, but resides with Applicant\u2019s older brother in Canada during part of\nthe year.\nApplicant was briefly married to a PRC national from Hong Kong. They met in 2000 through\na personals advertisement in a Hong Kong newspaper, and communicated for several months by\n\n\u201cUncontrolled\u201d meaning not properly marked with the classification of the data contained on the disk and not\n2\nbringing the disk into the accountability system for handling classified information.\nFrom a classified computer to an unclassified computer.\n3\nHe stated \u201cI had to decide whether to get married in a week.\u201d However, Applicant was already married when\n4\nthe violation occurred.\nThe Facility Security Officer at Applicant\u2019s company testified that Applicant\u2019s attendance was confirmed by\n5\nan entry in the company\u2019s security database. The entry in the database was based on Applicant\u2019s signing in at the seminar\n(Tr. 204). She further testified that every employee gets trained on the company\u2019s information security program before\nthey are given a company email account (Tr. 193).\n3\ntelephone and email. In June 2000, he flew to Hong Kong to meet her and her family, then they\nembarked on a two-week, pre-wedding honeymoon to Japan and Europe. She immigrated to the\nU.S., where they were married in September 2000. They separated 4\u00bd months later, ostensibly\nbecause of her videotaped unfaithfulness. They were divorced in February 2002. \nApplicant has traveled to Hong Kong on a number of occasions, and for a variety of reasons,\nsince 1997. In June 1997 he traveled to Hong Kong to visit family and friends. He did so again in\nDecember 1998, and met his email pen pal in person. He traveled to Hong Kong in June 2000 to\nmeet his prospective bride and take her on a pre-marriage honeymoon trip. In December 2001, he\nreturned to Hong Kong with his mother\u2014and traveled to the PRC as well\u2014so she could visit with\nfamily. Finally, he traveled to Hong Kong in December 2005 to visit friends.\nOn 10 October 2000, Applicant was terminated from employment after being debriefed from\naccess to classified information by the defense contractor for whom he had worked since September\n1996. A number of security concerns lead to his termination. On 18 September 2000, six days after\nhis marriage, Applicant sent three classified files by unclassified email to another defense contractor\nworking on the same project. The security violation was discovered almost immediately, and both\ncompanies took quick action to ensure that the classified files had not been compromised, ultimately\nconcluding that the risk of compromise was minimal (G.E. 6).\nThe ensuing investigation disclosed the component violations in the incident: improperly\ncopying classified information from the classified computer, improperly loading the classified\ninformation onto an uncontrolled disk,  improperly transferring classified data from one system to\n2\nanother,  and improperly transmitting classified materials (G.E. 4). Applicant has variously ascribed\n3\nthe violation to \u201cthe pressure of the deadline and no one around to help me and the manager was (sic)\non vacation (G.E. 2),\u201d to not being informed by the company that he could not transmit classified\ninformation by unclassified email and worrying about his fiance\u2019s situation (G.E. 7,  Answer), to a\n4\ngeneral lack of training (Tr. 154). However, he acknowledged that he knew he should not send\nclassified information over the internet (Tr. 94). Further, company records reflect that Applicant\nattended a week-long security awareness seminar\u2014required of every employee with a security\nclearance\u2014in November 1999.  \n5\n\nAt the time of the security violation, Applicant worked in a specific laboratory for his employer (of many run\n6\nby the employer at the same location). Each laboratory had an information security representative\u2014a regular laboratory\nmember who had received additional training in information security to serve as a focal point for questions arising in the\nlaboratory.\nAccording to Applicant, the software program code is unclassified, but the database the program is supposed\n7\nto run is classified. This results in the computer being a classified computer, at the highest level of classification of any\nof the information in the database.\nApplicant claimed he did load the files into the other computer and print the code, contrary to the company\u2019s\n8\nrecorded version of the events. I find the company\u2019s version more credible, both because the company recorded the\nevents more-or-less contemporaneously and because the company designated this incident a \u201cpractice dangerous to\nsecurity\u201d rather than a security violation\u2014a distinction it made because the files on the disk were not downloaded to\nanother system or transmitted (Tr. 194).\nThe company considered this a falsification of his clearance application. Applicant attributed the mistake to\n9\nhis inability to read the fine print on the application, so when he saw \u201ccity, county, country,\u201d he assumed he should fill\nin the place of residence (G.E. 9). I find his explanation implausible, because his brother lives in Canada, not with\nApplicant.\n4\nAs a result of this security violation, Applicant received remedial training, which consisted\nof verbal counseling by his laboratory security officer  on the proper handling procedures, security\n6\noffice personnel also reviewing the proper procedures with him, and providing him with his\npersonal copy of the information security manual (to be thoroughly reviewed), among other\nmeasures. Applicant acknowledged that he received the manual, but testified that he did not review\nit because of the press of other business. During the course of the investigation, Applicant did not\nclaim that he had received inadequate training (Tr. 193). Further, both his laboratory manager and\na laboratory co-worker indicated that Applicant was aware of the requirements for handling and\ntransmitting classified information (G.E. 10).\nOn 26 September 2000, eight days after his first violation, Applicant committed essentially\nthe same violation in the laboratory. He needed to print the program code from the classified\ncomputer he was working on.  However, the classified computer did not have a printer attached to\n7\nit. So Applicant again copied the information he needed and loaded it onto another uncontrolled disk.\nHe intended to put the disk into another classified computer in the laboratory that had a printer.\nHowever, his improper copying of the files was discovered before he could complete his task.  The\n8\ncompany considered this the second security incident within a ten day period (G.E. 8), and Applicant\nwas removed from access to the company\u2019s classified areas. On 6 October 2000, he was debriefed\nfrom the classified program he was working on.\nThe ensuing investigation uncovered additional security-related anomalies regarding\nApplicant. The company discovered that Applicant\u2019s most recent clearance application incorrectly\nlisted his parents\u2019 places of birth as his residence address in the U.S. (instead of the PRC and Hong\nKong), and listed his and his brother\u2019s place of birth as his residence address in the U.S. (instead of\nHong Kong).  The company also decided it would be a prudent security measure to examine\n9\nApplicant\u2019s email account on his unclassified computer to ensure that no other classified information\nhad been improperly sent out.  None had, but the company discovered that Applicant had forwarded\nsensitive emails to many associates, both U.S. and foreign, including the woman he had just married.\nApplicant\u2019s emails disclosed that he worked in a classified lab and described details of his job and\nthe contracts he worked on, information sensitive to the company. The emails also contained\n\nThe company FSO described emails discussing diagrams, software, censor fusion information, and program\n10\nmanagement reviews\u2014all of which considered proprietary information (Tr. 197-198).\nApplicant attempted to portray an email concerning payment as merely a discussion of a dowry. However, the\n11\ncircumstances of Applicant\u2019s marriage are unusual at best. Applicant described it as similar to a mail-order bride,\nhowever, he has not addressed the internal inconsistencies raised by the speed with which he decided to marry, then\nbecame so suspicious of her fidelity that he thought it prudent to have her investigated, caught her on videotape, and\nseparated 4\u00bd months after their marriage.\nApplicant minimized the circumstances of his termination on his May 2003 clearance application (G.E. 2).\n12\nInstead of revealing that he was terminated or fired from this job, he stated only that he \u201cleft a job for other reasons under\nunfavorable circumstances.\u201d Similarly, instead of revealing that he improperly transmitted classified files, he stated only\nthat \u201cI sent out some files to the client by mistakes (sic) . . .\u201d He also minimized the circumstances of his termination\nduring his July 2003 subject interview (G.E. 7). During his initial questioning by the investigator, Applicant disclosed\nonly the improper transmission of files. Only in response to further prodding by the investigator did he disclose that the\nfiles were classified (Tr. 244-247).\nIn his clearance application (G.E. 2), Applicant listed his laboratory supervisor and a co-worker as two people\n13\nwho could confirm his claim that he had done nothing \u201cmalicious\u201d by transmitting the files by mistake. Indeed, both\nreferences stated their belief that Applicant did not act maliciously. However, both confirmed that Applicant had been\nproperly trained regarding his responsibility for handling classified information. His supervisor noted Applicant was\naloof, and had demonstrated poor judgment and a lack of attention to detail on several occasions regarding classified\ninformation. His co-worker stated Applicant did not perform his tasking satisfactorily, and described him as absent-\nminded and generally not a good fit for the position he was in (G.E. 10). His supervisor in his next job in 2000, which\ndid not require a clearance, voiced concerns about Applicant\u2019s ability to work with very sensitive classified information\nbecause of the emotional state he exhibited during his divorce and his tendency to be talkative on the job (G.E. 10).\n5\ndocuments and slide shows from his program manager (G.E. 5).  Additionally, there were emails\n10\nbetween Applicant and his fianc\u00e9 that raised suspicions about the legitimacy of the marriage.  The\n11\ncumulative effect of these discoveries, coupled with the two security incidents, was that Applicant\nwas terminated from his job on 10 October 2000.12\nApplicant\u2019s character references, who include his father, his pastor, a friend, and two\nprevious supervisors, consider Applicant an honest and trustworthy individual. They believe he can\nbe trusted to handle classified information. However, these favorable references must be compared\nagainst the unfavorable references developed during his background investigation (G.E. 10), which\ncall into question his suitability for access to classified information.13\nThe PRC is a repressive, totalitarian government with foreign policy goals antithetical to the\nU.S., although it has cooperated with the U.S. in the global war on terrorism in recent years. It has\nan active, effective intelligence service that targets U.S. intelligence and economic information, and\noperates against its citizens in the U.S. However, Hong Kong operates as an SAR of the PRC, with\nsubstantial independence until at least 2047.\nPOLICIES AND BURDEN OF PROOF\nThe Directive, Enclosure 2 lists adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating an\nApplicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information. Administrative Judges must assess both\ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative issue fairly raised by the facts and\ncircumstances presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense\n\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n14\nE2.A2.1.2.1. An immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or\n15\nobligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign country;\n6\nconsideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3. of the Directive. The presence or absence of a\ndisqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or against Applicant. However, specific\nadjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them, as they\nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified information.\nConsidering the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative\nguidelines are Guideline B (Foreign Influence), Guideline K (Security Violations), and Guideline\nE (Personal Conduct).\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant or continue an Applicant\u2019s security clearance. The government must prove, by something\nless than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it\nestablishes a prima facie case against access to classified information. Applicant must then refute,\nextenuate, or mitigate the government\u2019s case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the\nApplicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship with the\ngovernment based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a compelling interest in\nensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability, and trustworthiness of those\nwho must protect national interests as their own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d\nstandard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in\nfavor of the government.14\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe government failed to establish a case for disqualification under Guideline B. Applicant\u2019s\ntravel to Hong Kong (SOR 1.c.) and the PRC (SOR 1.d.) has no independent security significance.\nAt best, the travel might demonstrate ties of affection or obligation to someone living in either\ncountry.  Further, Applicant\u2019s contacts with his cousin in the PRC (SOR 1.b.) and his parents\u2019\n15\ncontacts with Hong Kong (SOR 1.e.) lack meaningful security significance because he has had no\ncontact with his cousin (who is also not an immediate family member) since his mother died in June\n2005, and his father is unable to travel to Hong Kong and no longer leases an apartment there.\nSimilarly, Applicant no longer has any contact with his email pen  pal in Hong Kong (SOR 1.a.).\nWhat remains is Applicant\u2019s semi-annual emails to his old high school math teacher and their\noccasional meals together when Applicant visits Hong Kong. The longevity of the relationship\nargues for its closeness. However, the nature and extent of the contacts otherwise argues against\nfinding that the contacts meet the threshold for ties of affection or obligation.\nThe plain language of the stated concerns and disqualifying factors of Guideline B may (or\nmay not) raise concerns and may (or may not) be disqualifying. This implies that mere citizenship\nof, or residence in, a foreign country of a person with close ties of affection or obligation to\nApplicant does not automatically establish the disqualifying conditions precedent to shift the burden\n\nE2.A2.11.1.2.2. Violations that are deliberate or multiple or due to negligence.\n16\nE2.A2.11.1.2.1. Unauthorized disclosure of classified information; \n17\nE2.A2.11.1.3. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include actions that:  E2.A2.11.1.3.1. Were\n18\ninadvertent;\nE2.A2.11.1.3.2. . . .Were isolated or infrequent;\n19\nE2.A2.11.1.3.3. . . .Were due to improper or inadequate training;\n20\nE2.A2.11.1.3.4. . . .Demonstrate a positive attitude towards the discharge of security responsibilities.\n21\n7\nto Applicant to mitigate the government\u2019s case. In this case, the evidence does not support a\nconclusion that Applicant has any such ties. I resolve Guideline B for Applicant.\nHowever, the government established a case for disqualification under Guideline K by\ndemonstrating that Applicant committed deliberate security violations during October 2000,  when\n16\nhe twice improperly downloaded classified information and once improperly transmitted classified\nfiles.  He also, for some period before October 2000, deliberately violated company security\n17\nregulations by transmitting proprietary information to individuals with no need for the information.\nMost of the mitigating conditions are inapplicable to Applicant. The security violations were\ndeliberate.  The security violations were arguably isolated or infrequent, but the violations of\n18\ncompany regulations regarding proprietary information were more extensive.  Applicant had been\n19\nproperly and regularly trained on the security requirements of his positions.  Finally the Applicant\u2019s\n20\ncurrent behavior fails to demonstrate a positive attitude towards the discharge of his security\nresponsibilities.  He has consistently denied responsibility for his security violations, asserting a\n21\nlack of training. He has consistently minimized the severity of the two October 2000 violations,\nwhich is emphasized by the speed with which the company first investigated the conduct, then acted\nto debrief Applicant and ultimately terminate his employment. These are not the actions of a\ncompany who viewed Applicant\u2019s conduct as harmless.\nFurther, Applicant has consistently sought to draw artificial distinctions between various\ndegrees of security violations based on a narrow focus on the characterizations used in conducting\nsecurity violation investigations. The National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual\n(NISPOM), January 1995, defines \u201csecurity violation\u201d as a \u201cfailure to comply with the policy and\nprocedures established by this Manual that reasonably could result in the loss or compromise of\nclassified information.\u201d Applicant\u2019s two security incidents in October 2000 satisfy this definition\nnotwithstanding that the company characterized the first as a \u201cviolation\u201d because classified\ninformation was removed from the laboratory, and the second as a \u201cpractice dangerous to security\u201d\nbecause the classified information was intercepted before it could be lost or compromised. A\n\u201cpractice dangerous to security\u201d was still considered a violation of the rules and regulations (Tr.\n195). In addition, Guideline K does not confine itself to security regulations that deal only with the\nhandling of classified information. Security regulations can, and do, deal with safeguarding official\nuse or privacy act material, as well as with operational security\u2014which deals with safeguarding\notherwise unclassified and unrelated pieces of information that may have security significance in the\naggregate. Internally, defense contractors, as here, may have security regulations regarding use and\n\nE2.A5.1.2.1. Reliable unfavorable information provided by associates, employers, coworkers, neighbors, and\n22\nother acquaintances;\nE2.A5.1.2.5. A pattern of dishonesty or rule violations, including violation of any written or recorded\n23\nagreement made between the individual and the agency;\nE2.A5.1.2.3. Deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning relevant and material matters\n24\nto an investigator, security official, competent medical authority, or other official representative in connection with a\npersonnel security or trustworthiness determination;\nE2.A5.1.3.1. The information was unsubstantiated or not pertinent to a determination of judgment,\n25\ntrustworthiness, or reliability;\nE2.A5.1.2.2. The falsification was an isolated incident, was not recent, and the individual has subsequently\n26\nprovided correct information voluntarily; \nE2.A5.1.2.3. The individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the falsification before being\n27\nconfronted with the facts;\nE2.A5.1.2.4. Omission of material facts was caused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate\n28\nadvice of authorized personnel, and the previously omitted information was promptly and fully provided;\n8\ndissemination of company proprietary information. Violations of any of these varied kinds of\nsecurity regulations raises doubts about an applicant\u2019s willingness and ability to safeguard classified\ninformation. Indeed, it would be anomalous to suggest that an individual who had never been\ncleared, but who had violated his employer\u2019s requirements for safeguarding information in other\nareas, could not have his case adjudicated under Guideline K. I resolve Guideline K against\nApplicant.\nFinally, the government established a Guideline E case by demonstrating Applicant\u2019s\nquestionable judgment in executing his security responsibilities over an extended period of time.22\nWhile his violations of the NISPOM were confined to October 2006, his violation of company\nregulations covered a greater period of time.   In addition, he minimized his conduct, both on his\n23\nclearance application and during his subject interview.24\nApplicant meets none of the mitigating conditions under personal conduct. His conduct was\nsubstantiated and pertinent to a judgment determination.  His misleading description of his\n25\ntermination, both on his application and during his subject interview was neither isolated nor\ndistant.  He did not disclose the full circumstances of his termination until pressed by the\n26\ninvestigator during the subject interview.  Nor did Applicant receive bad advice about what adverse\n27\ninformation he should reveal.  I resolve Guideline E against Applicant.\n28\nFORMAL FINDINGS\n\n9\nParagraph 1.

Applicant requested a hearing.\nOn May 7, 2007, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Elizabeth M. Matchinski denied\nApplicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Department Counsel filed a timely appeal pursuant to\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.  \nApplicant raises the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in concluding that\nApplicant had not met his burden of persuasion as to the application of relevant mitigating\nconditions and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance decision is arbitrary, capricious, and\ncontrary to law.  Finding no error, we affirm.\nThe Judge found that Applicant, a senior systems administrator for a defense contractor,\ncommitted numerous security violations from 1997 through 2006.  These include five instances of\nfailing to secure DoD-approved security containers designed for the storage of classified material;\ntwo instances of failure to secure a classified computer hard disk drive, and one instance of failing\nto secure a box containing material marked TOP SECRET.  This last incident occurred nearly a year\nafter the date of the SOR in Applicant\u2019s case.   Additionally, one of the improperly secured hard disk\n1\ndrives was never recovered.2\nIn analyzing the case, the Judge noted that two mitigating conditions were possibly\napplicable\u2013that Applicant\u2019s infractions were inadvertent  and that he showed a positive attitude\n3\ntoward his security responsibilities.   However, the Judge also took into consideration the fact that\n4\nApplicant\u2019s security violations span almost the whole of his employment with the federal contractor,\nthe first incident occurring only two months into his tenure.  She also noted that the latest violation\noccurred  after nine years of job experience and that various corrective steps taken by Applicant\u2019s\nemployer had been unsuccessful.  Balancing the mitigating factors with the security concerns, the\nJudge concluded that Applicant had not met his burden of persuasion that it is clearly consistent with\nthe interests of national security for him to have a clearance.  See Department of the Navy v. Egan,\n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988); Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. (\u201cThe applicant is responsible for presenting\nwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant\nor proven by Department Counsel, and has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a\nfavorable security clearance.\u201d) \nApplicant argues on appeal that the Judge erred in not applying two other mitigating\nconditions\u2013that the security incidents were isolated or infrequent and that they resulted from\nimproper or inadequate training.   The Board does not find this argument persuasive.  Given the\n5\n\nApplicant testified that upon starting his employment he was briefed on security procedures.  Tr. at 136.\n6\nGovernment Exhibit 3 consists of security training material prepared by Applicant\u2019s employer, which covers potential\ninfractions such as those committed by Applicant.  Additionally, various Government exhibits address the specific\nsecurity violations in Applicant\u2019s case and advise that remedial action included his being \u201cre-indoctrinated\u201d in security\nprocedures.  See, e.g., Government Exhibit 21 at 2.  \n3\ninherent seriousness of security violations, committing eight over a nine year period is a reasonable\nbasis for concluding that they are not infrequent.  See ISCR Case No. 03-26888 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct.\n5, 2006) (\u201cSecurity violations are one of the strongest possible reasons for denying or revoking\naccess to classified information, as they raise very serious questions about an applicant\u2019s suitability\nfor access to classified information.\u201d) (internal citations omitted); ISCR Case No. 01-24358 at 4\n(App. Bd. Apr. 13, 2004) (Judge concluded that Applicant\u2019s failure to safeguard six classified\ndocuments over a ten year period was isolated or infrequent.  Board reversed the Judge, holding the\nJudge\u2019s conclusion to be arbitrary and capricious.)  Furthermore, the Board finds no basis to disturb\nthe Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant\u2019s security violations were not caused by improper or\ninadequate training.   \n6\nExamining the Judge\u2019s decision in light of her findings and the record as a whole, the Board\nconcludes that she articulates \u201ca satisfactory explanation for\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational\nconnection between the facts found and the choices made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

On the reissuance, the January 1995\n1\nNISPOM was cancelled. It was therefore error for the government to allege a violation of the January 1995 NISPOM\nin August 2006, although \u00b6 5-100 (the obligation to safeguard classified information) had not changed. \n2\nApplicant is a computer systems administrator who failed to properly secure a classified\nstorage container in September 1997, September 1999, February 2001, July 2002, and November\n2002. He failed to safeguard two classified hard disk drives in his custody, and one disk was still\nunaccounted for as of March 2007. In August 2006, he left a TOP SECRET tape cartridge\nunprotected on top of a classified storage container, failing to secure it before he left the office. His\nmultiple security violations, while unintentional, raise considerable doubts about his ability to meet\nhis  security clearance obligations. Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for Applicant. As required by Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 \u00b6 E3.1.2\n(Jan. 2, 1992), as amended, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on August 26, 2005,\ndetailing the basis for its decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline K (Security Violations)\nof the adjudicative guidelines. Applicant answered the SOR on October 12, 2006, and elected to\nhave a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on November 30, 2006.\nOn January 25, 2007, I scheduled a hearing for March 1, 2007.\nOn January 29, 2007, the government moved to amend the SOR to add \u00b6 1.h under Guideline\nK, alleging that on or about August 18, 2006, Applicant failed to properly secure a box that held a\ntape cartridge marked TOP SECRET and an envelope marked TOP SECRET that contained\nclassified password information, thereby violating \u00b6\u00b6 5-100 and 5-303 of the National Industrial\nSecurity Program Operating Manual (NISPOM) issued January 1995  as well as \u00b6\u00b6 4.7, 4.15, and\n1\n4.16 of Section 12 and \u00b6 3.1 of Section 17 of his employer\u2019s standards practices procedures (SPP).\nOn January 30, 2007, I granted the motion and gave Applicant until February 20, 2007, to respond\nto \u00b6 1.h or it would be considered admitted.\nIn a conference call with the parties on February 28, 2007, Applicant requested a continuance\nand indicated he had no objection to \u00b6 1.h as proposed. The SOR was accordingly amended as\nrequested by the government. Applicant was also granted a brief continuance. \nA hearing was convened on March 29, 2007, to consider whether it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. The government\u2019s case\nconsisted of 29 exhibits (Ex. 1- 29 ), entered without objection, and the testimony of a Defense\nSecurity Service (DSS) senior industrial security specialist. Applicant submitted 11 exhibits (Ex.\nA-J, and L) into the record. An additional document, initially identified as Ex. K, was withdrawn.\nApplicant and his supervisor testified, as reflected in a hearing transcript (Tr.) received on April 12,\n2007.\n\nApplicant testified, unrebutted by the government, that he was briefed by document as to his COMSEC\n2\nresponsibilities. (Tr. 135)\nPersonnel access to the facility was and continues to be controlled by a professional proprietary guard force\n3\nthat conducts foot patrols and monitors a central control station equipped with a closed circuit television system and a\nDoD-accredited alarm/card access control system. The closed area and building perimeter are equipped with a card\nreader system unique to the facility. In addition, the closed area entrance is equipped with a closed circuit camera for\nmonitoring purposes. (See Ex. 22)\n3\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nIn the SOR as amended, DOHA alleges Applicant failed to properly secure a DoD approved\nsecurity container on September 14, 1997 (SOR \u00b6 1.a), September 11, 1999 (SOR \u00b6 1.b), February\n28, 2001 (\u00b6 1.c), July 25, 2002 (\u00b6 1.e), and November 24, 2002 (\u00b6 1.f), Applicant is also alleged to\nhave failed to properly secure a classified computer hard disk drive in about 2002 (\u00b6 1.d) and in April\n2003 (\u00b6 1.g), and a box containing TOP SECRET information on or about August 18, 2006 (\u00b61.h).\nThe conduct set forth in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.h was alleged to be in violation of \u00b6\u00b6 5-100 and 5-303\nof the NISPOM, and Section 12 \u00b6\u00b6 4.7, 4.15, and 4.16 and Section 17 \u00b6 3.1 of his employer\u2019s SPP.\nApplicant admits he failed to secure the approved security container on the dates alleged, but\noffers in mitigation that he had access less than 30 days (September 1997); had additional\nresponsibilities (September 1999 and February 2001); the computer hard drive had been transferred\nto him and been removed from service for two years and was not used to store classified data (2002);\nno compromise of classified information  occurred as confirmed by full inventory (September 1997,\nSeptember 1999, February 2001, July 2002, November 2002); the hard drive not secured in April\n2003 was found installed in an existing classified system as a secondary drive in a secure\nenvironment; and the recent violation was an oversight. He averred all of the incidents occurred in\na closed area with access limited to those with SECRET-level clearances and \u201cneed-to-know,\u201d and\nthat as a result of the April 2003 incident concerning the system hard drive, new security procedures\nhad been implemented at the company.\nAfter consideration of the pleadings, exhibits, and hearing transcript, I make the following\nfindings of fact:\nApplicant is a 39-year-old senior systems administrator who has worked for a defense\ncontractor since July 1997, staying on with the company after it was purchased by another defense\nfirm in 1999. Applicant was initially granted a SECRET-level security clearance for his duties as a\ncomputer software analyst in the Army National Guard. That clearance was transferred on his\nemploy with the defense contractor. His clearance was subsequently upgraded to TOP SECRET in\nOctober 1998.\nIn August 1997, Applicant was granted a SECRET-level clearance for his duties as systems\nadministrator for a UNIX-based classified engineering platform supporting various encryption\nproducts developed by the company for multiple U.S. government contracts. He was assigned\nresponsibility for a classified container approved for the storage of SECRET/COMSEC\n(communications security) information and briefed as to his COMSEC responsibilities.  The storage\n2\ncontainer was located in a Department of Defense\u2013accredited closed area of the facility where access\nwas limited to those cleared to the SECRET level at a minimum and had a \u201cneed to know.\u201d3\n\n4\nApplicant regularly accessed the storage container in performing his duties, which included not only\nconfiguring and maintaining the UNIX workstations and servers, but also maintaining backup tapes\nthat were stored in the container. On September 14, 1997, he failed to properly secure the security\ncontainer (SOR \u00b6 1.a) due to oversight. (Ex. 14) An inventory of the storage container was conducted\nand all classified materials were accounted for. Applicant was counseled about this security lapse,\nwhich he attributed to his lack of experience and failure to appreciate the importance of security.\nApplicant demonstrated core competencies during his first full year on the job. Well liked\nby the project users, and technically proficient, Applicant looked for ways to become more efficient.\nNot one to be intimidated by new problems, Applicant was noted by his supervisor as sometimes\ntaking on \u201csometimes too many\u201d new challenges. (Ex. C)\nIn 1999, Applicant\u2019s employer was acquired by a large defense contracting firm. Applicant\nwas promoted to the position of lead system administrator, and was responsible for providing\nadministrative support for a large classified local area network with more than 150 workstations. On\nSeptember 10, 1999, Applicant accessed a security container approved to safeguard\nSECRET/COMSEC material. His supervisor was the primary custodian for the container, which was\nlocated in a DoD\u2013accredited closed area. Applicant was the alternate custodian. Applicant got\ndistracted by employees needing his systems administration assistance, and he failed to properly\nsecure the container before he left the facility at around 1630 hours. (SOR \u00b6 1.b) At around 0100\nhours the next morning, a cleared member of the plant protection staff discovered the container\nunsecured and unattended. He noted a random sample of the contents and secured the container.\nCompany security conducted an administrative inquiry during which  the classified material assigned\nto all custodians of record was inventoried. All material was properly accounted for. The\ncombination to the security container was also changed. Applicant was found responsible for a non-\ndeliberate security violation and his supervisor was informed. On September 17, 1999, Applicant\u2019s\nemployer notified the government agency with cognizance over the classified material (government\nagency X) of Applicant\u2019s culpability and of its conclusion that no loss or compromise had occurred.\n(Ex. 22)\nOn February 28, 2001, Applicant failed to properly secure his security container approved\nto safeguard SECRET/COMSEC classified material when he left the facility for the day at around\n1650 hours. Involved at the time in restoring computer files to the system, Applicant again got\ndistracted by activity in the closed area and system user inquiries. (SOR \u00b6 1.c) A plant protection\nguard discovered the container unsecured at around 1720. As in 1999, the company performed an\ninventory of all classified material assigned to Applicant as custodian of the container, and all\nclassified material was properly accounted for. The classified material involved in this incident was\nnot accountable under the COMSEC account. On March 14, 2001, company security notified\ngovernment agency X of its findings that Applicant was culpable, but that no loss or compromise\nhad occurred. Applicant was re-indoctrinated as to his security responsibilities. (Ex. 21) Because the\nincident did not involve any COMSEC material, government agency X considered it \u201cNot a\nReportable Incident\u201d but informed the company that it had to be reported to the local Defense\nSecurity Service (DSS) industrial security representative. (Ex. 20)\nOn February 20, 2001, Applicant was assigned custodial responsibility for a\nSECRET/COMSEC hard disk drive that had been in the company\u2019s classified document\naccountability system since February 27, 1995. The disk drive was transferred to Applicant when the\n\n5\nformer custodian left the company. In March 2001, a cleared member of the security department\nconducted a classified material inventory of Applicant\u2019s holdings and personally sighted the hard\ndisk drive.  The hard disk drive was integral to a workstation that was installed only with a specific\nUNIX operating system. The client/server configuration for the system was such that all user data\nwas stored on the server rather than on the workstation\u2019s disk. The workstation was used only as a\ndisplay device and for its processing power. On or about August 14, 2001, the workstation associated\nwith the hard disk drive was sent to recycling to be crushed. Before the workstation was released\nfrom the classified environment, it was checked by a cleared member of the engineering staff to\nensure that the hard disk drive had been removed. (Exs. 9, 10, 16)\nDuring internal security reviews conducted from March 2002 and May 2002, the hard disk\ndrive could not be located. The company\u2019s classified material control center operations were\nreviewed, including all custodian security files, and accountability and transaction records. When\nquestioned about the hard disk drive, Applicant expressed his belief that the disk drive had been\nreturned to the classified material control center on July 10, 2001, for destruction along with other\nclassified hard drives, but the classified material control center\u2019s database and signature cards\nrevealed Applicant was still the active custodian. Applicant was assessed as culpable for the loss of\nthe hard disk drive as he was the custodian of record (SOR \u00b6 1.d), and the company submitted an\nadverse information report to DISCO. Applicant was also re-briefed as to his responsibilities. (Ex.\n10) As a direct result of the incident, systems administrators were required to audit each other six\nmonths before the annual security department audit due to the large volume of classified assets\nassigned to them. Two person validation was also required for any changes to classified inventory,\ni.e., items to be disposed of as surplus, turned in for destruction, brought into accountability. (Ex.\n16) Markings were to be affixed to the media inside a workstation when the media was removed and\nsecurity numbers of the drive placed in the title of the document so that any media to be destroyed\ncould be tracked by both the document control number and the serial number.\nOn July 25, 2002, Applicant failed to properly secure his security container approved to\nsafeguard SECRET/COMSEC classified material when he left the facility for the day at around 1700\nhours. Applicant again got distracted by activity in the closed area and system user inquiries. (SOR\n\u00b6 1.e) A plant protection guard discovered the container unsecured at around 1815, and conducted\na random sample of the contents, which were not accountable under the COMSEC account. An\ninventory was conducted and all classified material properly accounted for. On September 12, 2002,\ncompany security notified government agency X of the violation, its conclusion that no loss or\ncompromise had occurred, and that Applicant had been re-indoctrinated as to his security\nresponsibilities. (Ex. 19) Government agency X considered the occurrence as a practice dangerous\nto security. (Ex. 18)\nOn November 7, 2002, company security notified government agency X it had been unable\nto locate a hard drive missing since the inventory of Applicant\u2019s container conducted between March\nand May 2002 (\u00b6 1.d). While compromise was possible, company security personnel considered it\nvery low or remote given the system configuration (classified information was processed using the\nworkstation to a server environment and not to the operating system\u2019s hard disk drive). The company\nspeculated that the disk drive may have been removed from the personal computer tower and\ninadvertently turned in to the classified material control center absent any control number or security\nclassification marking, since in the early 1990s the company had affixed the classified material\ncontrol numbers to the personal computer tower and not the hard drive disk itself. The item would\n\n6\nhave been treated as \u201ccompany sensitive\u201d and destroyed in the same manner as classified material\nwas destroyed under the contract. (Ex. 16) Government agency X did not conduct an independent\nevaluation since there was no COMSEC involved. (Ex. 15) The DSS subsequently filed its own\nreport of the loss to government agency X. While the DSS agreed that the hard disk drive likely was\nshipped to the government contracting agency and destroyed in the same manner as material that\nbore classified markings, there was no guarantee that the hard disk drive had been destroyed. There\nwas no record that the hard disk drive had been shipped to the government. Since the hard drive had\nnot been located, it was considered a loss by the DSS. (Ex. 10)\nApplicant left his security container unsecured on November 24, 2002 (\u00b6 1.f). He had come\nin to work on a Sunday to correct problems on the servers, and short on time, neglected to lock the\nclassified storage container before he left at around 1545 hours. A plant protection officer discovered\nthe violation at around 1725 hours. (Ex. 11) An inventory of the container revealed no loss of any\naccountable items. In reporting the incident to company security, Applicant\u2019s supervisor noted the\nrigors and hectic activity in the laboratory where the container was located and Applicant being\nusually the first \u201cto bring to peoples [sic] attention concerns and policies related to security.\u201d In an\neffort to prevent a recurrence, the supervisor recommended to Applicant that he put the lock for the\ncontainer in his pocket. The container was also removed from the server area to force Applicant to\nleave his workstation to obtain classified material. The hope was that it would eliminate the\npossibility of Applicant leaving the container open when he was working. Steps were also taken to\neliminate the old backup tapes stored in Applicant\u2019s container as they were no longer needed.\nApplicant was informed that another security violation within the calender year would result in a\nreprimand and a week off without pay. (Ex. 14) Company security concluded there was no loss or\ncompromise of classified material, but filed an adverse information report with the Defense Security\nService Operations Center on January 10, 2003, since it was Applicant\u2019s third security violation in\na calendar year. (Ex. 12, Ex. 13) Government agency X evaluated the occurrence as a \u201cPractice\nDangerous to Security.\u201d (Ex. 11)\nOn June 25, 2003, Applicant was interviewed by a DSS special agent about his security\nviolations. He acknowledged he had failed to properly secure his classified storage container in\nSeptember 1997, September 1999, February 2001, July 2002, and November 2002, but asserted he\nhad not had a similar security lapse since his storage container had been moved from his immediate\nwork area. As for the missing hard drive, Applicant explained that the disk lost since 2001 had been\nin a system processed for surplus, but that particular hard drive disk had not been recorded as having\nbeen returned to the classified material control center. He indicated it might have been left in the\ncomputer, the contents of which were not checked before disposal. Since the hard drive was\nconfigured to operate the system and not to store information, Applicant maintained there could not\nhave been any classified information on the missing hard drive. Applicant also indicated that security\nwas investigating the loss of a second hard disk drive that could not be located during an audit of his\nclassified storage container in April 2003. He could not recall what happened to the disk after he\nvalidated that the disk was defective in September 2002, but asserted it did not contain classified\nmaterial.\n \nIn August 2003, company security notified the DSS that it could not account for a second\nhard disk drive (\u00b6 1.g). The hard disk drive, internal to an unclassified workstation, had been brought\ninto company classified material control accountability on July 30, 2002, when the workstation was\nconnected to an approved information system classified SECRET/COMSEC. After installation of\n\nA DSS industrial security representative with cognizance over the facility until 2004 testified that since the hard\n4\ndrive was unavailable for review, DSS could not determine for certain that no classified was on the drive. It had been\nconnected to a classified system so it was possible that classified information was on the disk and had to be treated as\nsuch. (Tr. 84-86)\nApplicant reaffirmed at his hearing that the drive could not have been used. Unable to recall previously, he\n5\nclaimed to have a clear recollection of having installed it into the system where it was found (\u201cit was the way it was\ninstalled, I knew it was mine. Those systems are not opened without our permission or without our direct involvement.\n. .\u201d Tr. 237). \n7\nthe operating system failed, the engineer with custody returned the hard disk drive to the classified\nmaterial control center for destruction. On September 9, 2002, Applicant had taken custody of the\nhard disk drive from the classified material control center after a series of internal disk drive failures.\nAs systems administrator for the SECRET/COMSEC information system, he wanted to determine\nthe cause of the disk failure. An internal review of all classified material assigned to the facility was\nconducted between March 2003 and June 11, 2003. During the course of this audit, the hard disk\ndrive could not be found. The classified material control center\u2019s operations, including all custodian\nsecurity files at the facility, were then re-inventoried, all accountability and transaction records were\nexamined, and every controlled system tower under the SECRET/COMSEC information system was\nopened with drives verified by inventory records. When the hard disk drive failed to turn up after all\nthese reviews, Applicant was assessed culpability for failure to account for the hard drive and he was\nsuspended for one week without pay from work effective August 11, 2003. He was also briefed on\nsecurity awareness, but the company did not consider removing him from his position of information\nsystems security officer. A new department policy was instituted prohibiting the recall of any\ncontrolled item turned in to the classified material control center for destruction. Another employee\nwas also hired to take over  part of Applicant\u2019s demanding workload. Company security concluded\nthat a loss had occurred but that the possibility of a compromise of classified information did not\nappear to exist as the disk drive was in a defective state (could not initiate installation of the\noperating system) when it left the classified material control center. Per Applicant, who was the\nsystems administrator, further testing would not have exposed the hard disk drive to classified\ninformation. (Ex. 7; Ex. 8)\nOn November 26, 2003, the DSS notified government agency X that the hard disk drive\ncould not be located and must be considered lost. Compromise could not be ruled out since it was\nnot known what information was transferred, if any, to the hard drive during the failed installation,\nand Applicant was unable to recall what he did with the hard disk drive after he took custody. It\ncould have been connected to the system after the failed installation as it bore classified markings\nand anyone finding it would assume it could be used on a classified system. (Ex. 5; Ex. 6) On\nDecember 1, 2003, the DSS issued an adverse information report noting Applicant\u2019s culpability for\nfailure to account for the hard disk drive, which had to be treated as SECRET/COMSEC, due to its\nconnection to a classified network and unavailability for review.  (Ex. 4) In about June 2004, a\n4\nsubordinate of Applicant\u2019s discovered the hard disk drive installed in an existing classified system\nas a secondary drive connected via data and power cables but not configured for access by the\nclassified system. Subsequent checks of the internal hard disk drive verified that the disk had no\ninteraction with the classified network. The disk had not been modified after the operating system\ninstallation failed. (Ex. L) 5\n\n8\nOn August 26, 2005, DOHA issued an SOR to Applicant because of his failures to properly\nsecure DoD approved security containers in September 1997, September 1999, February 2001, July\n2002, and November 2002, and failures to properly secure classified computer hard disk drives in\n2002 and in April 2003. Applicant admitted the violations but indicated that he had made significant\nchanges in his work procedures as evidenced by the absence of any security violations and 100%\naudit of his classified holdings for the past two years.\nAt around 1630 hours on August 18, 2006,  Applicant accessed a classified storage container\nin the security office to transfer backup media. Applicant was supporting another systems\nadministrator at the time and not entirely familiar with the routine. He removed a cardboard box\ncontaining a tape cartridge marked TOP SECRET in order to access the needed classified tapes\nunder it. Also in the box was a white envelope containing password information marked TOP\nSECRET. After he completed the transfer of tapes, he secured the cabinet leaving the box containing\nthe  password information and classified tape cartridge unsecured on top of the container. (Ex. 24;\nEx. 26) At about 1745 hours, the plant protection supervisor noticed the TOP SECRET material and\nproperly secured it. (Ex. 24; Ex. 25) Company security personnel conducted an administrative\ninquiry into the violation. In reporting the violation to the DSS in January 2007, the security manager\nindicated that the envelope marked TOP SECRET actually contained unclassified interim passwords\nused to initialize a server prior to the server being deployed in a classified environment, and that it\nwas a common practice by the engineering organization to record passwords on the server while it\nwas being built to ensure they were not forgotten. Once deployed in the classified environment, the\npasswords were changed and the server brought into accountability. The security manager also\nmaintained that there had been no compromise of the tape cartridge that was classified, as the\nsecurity office, although not located in a closed area, had been occupied until 1730 hours when the\nlast person left and locked the door. Anyone that would have entered the office during non-working\nhours would have been challenged by security office personnel. In addition, the classified\ninformation on the cartridge could be accessed only through a compatible classified information\nsystem. Applicant\u2019s supervisor was notified of the violation, but since it was Applicant\u2019s first in a\n12-month period, disciplinary action was not warranted under company security policy. (Ex. 24)\nApplicant has consistently exceeded position expectations in a demanding classified\nenvironment. (Ex. A\u2013Ex. J) As an information systems security officer for the past five or so years\nas well as the senior systems administrator for two particular classified systems, he has supported\nthe information systems security manager who has overall responsibility for information security\npolicy and implementation at the facility. In 2003, Applicant  struggled in some areas including\nimplementation of automated information systems security requirements, due to the high workload,\na coworker\u2019s failure to meet work expectations, and Applicant\u2019s efforts to keep systems users happy.\n(Ex. G) He worked diligently to bring the systems into compliance with the NISPOM in 2004. (Ex.\nH) Due in large part to Applicant\u2019s dedication, NISPOM requirements were met on a daily basis, and\nApplicant met his goal of no security violations in 2005 (Ex. I). Noting that Applicant faced potential\nloss of his clearance due to past security violations, Applicant\u2019s manager noted in his evaluation of\nApplicant\u2019s performance for 2005 that the loss of clearance by Applicant would have a major impact\nin support of the classified systems. (Ex. I)\nIn 2006, Applicant continued to manage the software development engineering for classified\nprojects in his building, to configure and maintain UNIX workstations and servers, to provide\nsupport for users, to interface with vendors, to support program management, and to train and mentor\n\n9\nthe coworker hired to take on some of his  responsibilities.(Ex. J) Applicant\u2019s continued access to\nclassified material is supported by his supervisor, the information systems security manager, and\nanother systems administrator. Applicant has a reputation at work of requiring the users of his\nsystems to comply with security requirements. The company\u2019s information systems security manager\nattributes Applicant\u2019s violations to Applicant\u2019s desire to take full responsibility for the environment\nand to maintain control over all assets rather than delegate to others. In his opinion, none of\nApplicant\u2019s violations were intentional or due to reckless disregard of security procedures, and the\npotential for future security incidents has been reduced by the implementation of procedures\ndesigned to give Applicant more time and attention to the protection of classified assets. (Ex. A) A\nsystems administrator attests to Applicant demonstrating technical excellence as well as insistence\non strict adherence to security guidelines by team members. He has experienced Applicant as\n\u201czealous in educating himself in proper handling procedures and rules and then in disseminating this\ninformation to members of the team.\u201d (Ex. B) As of 2007, Applicant was responsible for between\n130-150 classified assets (systems as well as tapes stored on a regular basis), as half of his work had\nbeen delegated to a capable subordinate.\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527.\nThe President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants eligibility for\naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb.\n20, 1960). An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App.\nBd. Dec. 19, 2002).\nThe adjudicative guidelines set forth potentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating\nconditions (MC) under each guideline. In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the\nadministrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6 6.3 of the Directive.\nThe decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the\nloyalty of the applicant. See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met\nthe strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a\nclearance. \nCONCLUSIONS\nGuideline K\u2014Security Violations\nNoncompliance with security regulations raises doubt about an individual\u2019s trustworthiness,\nwillingness, and ability to safeguard classified information. Directive \u00b6 E2.A11.1.1 Responsible\nunder the NISPOM and his employer\u2019s security policy (SPP) to safeguard classified information\nunder his custody or in his control, Applicant violated NISPOM \u00b6 5-100 and his company\u2019s SPP \u00a7\n\nNISPOM \u00b6 5-100 sets forth the general requirement for contractors and individuals to safeguard the classified\n6\ninformation in their custody and/or control. Company security policy provides under \u00a712 \u00b6 3.1 that all employees,\ncontract labor personnel and consultants are responsible for providing the proper protection and accountability for all\nclassified information entrusted to them at all times. \u00a7 12 \u00b6 4.7 requires employees to safeguard all classified information\nunder their control and to adhere to the security policy and procedures to preclude the possibility of access to classified\ninformation by unauthorized persons. \u00a7 12 \u00b6 4.15 mandates compliance with established procedures in the protection,\nrecording, and storage of classified material issued to them for their use. \u00a7 12 \u00b6 4.16 mandates employees control\nclassified material entrusted to them.\nUnder \u00b6 8-105.c.(1) all users are required to comply with the industrial security program requirements. \u00b6 8-\n7\n105.c(3) specifies that all users are accountable for their actions on an information security system. Under \u00b6 8-104.a.\ninformation system security officers are required to ensure the implementation of security measures,  in accordance with\nfacility procedures. These include implementation of the facility procedures governing the marking, handling, controlling,\nremoving, transporting, sanitizing, reusing, and destroying media and equipment containing classified information (\u00b6 8-\n104.i.(1).\nNISPOM \u00b6 5-302 requires that TOP SECRET material shall be stored in a GSA-approved security container,\n8\nan approved vault, or an approved closed area with supplemental controls). The company\u2019s security policy specifies\nunder  \u00a7 17 \u00b6 3.1 of its manual (Ex. 3) that all TOP SECRET, SECRET, and CONFIDENTIAL material shall be stored\nin an approved security container, vault or Closed Area when not in use.\n10\n12 \u00b6\u00b6 3.1, 4.7, 4.15, 4.16  on several occasions between 1997 and August 2006. On five separate\n6\noccasions between September 1997 and November 2002, he failed to properly secure a container\napproved for the storage of information classified to the SECRET-level. Sometime after March 2001,\nhe could not account for a hard disk drive classified SECRET/COMSEC for which he was the\ncustodian of record. As of March 2007, that disk drive had not been located. A second hard disk\ndrive that Applicant took custody of in September 2001 was missing until about June 2004 when it\nwas discovered as a secondary drive in a computer system. Since the hard disk drive had been in a\nworkstation connected to a classified system and used in a failed effort to upload a classified\noperating system, it was required to be protected as SECRET until it could be cleaned or at least\nverified to be defective. In failing to properly safeguard the classified hard drive, he violated the\nsecurity procedures in place to protect automated information system media set forth in \u00b6\u00b6 8-105.c(1)\nand 8-105.c(3), and because of his position as information systems security officer, NISPOM \u00b6 8-104\nas well.  More recently in August 2006, he left a TOP SECRET tape cartridge out in the open in the\n7\nsecurity office. Unlike in the earlier security incidents, the security office was not located in a closed\narea of the facility. Since he left TOP SECRET information vulnerable to compromise, Applicant\nviolated \u00b6 5-302 of the NISPOM, dated February 28, 2006, and \u00a7 17 \u00b6 3.1 of his employer\u2019s security\npolicies,  in addition to NISPOM \u00b6 5-100 and \u00a7 12 \u00b6\u00b6 3.1, 4.7, 4.15, 4.16 of the company\u2019s SPP.\n8\nGuideline K disqualifying condition \u00b6 E2.A11.1.2.2, violations that are deliberate or multiple or due\nto negligence, is implicated by his record of eight separate security infractions over a ten-year span.\nTwo of Guideline K\u2019s four mitigating conditions are potentially applicable. \u00b6 E2.A11.1.3.2,\nviolations that were isolated or infrequent, cannot reasonably be considered, even though his eight\ninfractions represent a very small percentage in terms of opportunity. Individuals with security\noversight responsibilities must be counted on to fulfill their obligation to safeguard classified\nmaterial at all times. Improper or inadequate security training (see \u00b6 E2.A11.1.3.3) was not the cause\nof Applicant\u2019s leaving his security container unsecured. Even if his initial briefing was not to the\ndetail that Applicant would have liked, he knew he had to lock his classified storage container when\nit was not in use. However, since none of the violations was deliberate, \u00b6 E2.A11.1.3.1, violations\nthat were inadvertent, must be considered. Furthermore, Applicant\u2019s supervisor and the information\n\nConcerning the August 2006 infraction, Applicant testified that as he was starting the process of swapping out\n9\nthe tapes from the classified storage container, the director of security came out and asked him what was up (\u201cYou know,\nbecause he heard me, and you know, a bit of a start, I stopped, hey, how are you, just doing tapes, blah, blah, blah and,\nat that point continue on my work. Again, secured the container, completed my log, validated the lock and I left the\noffice.\u201d Tr. 248).\n11\nsystems security manager attest to Applicant\u2019s efforts to ensure that the users of his classified\nsystems comply with their security obligations, and to Applicant\u2019s collaboration in formulating\ncorrective actions to avoid recurrence, such as carrying the lock in his pocket and relocating the\nsecurity container outside of his immediate work area. These reflect  a positive attitude by Applicant\ntoward the discharge of his security responsibilities (see \u00b6 E2.A11.1.3.4). Yet, changes instituted to\nprevent a recurrence, most notably reducing by about half the number of classified assets within his\nsecurity cognizance, did not preclude him from again becoming distracted and leaving a TOP\nSECRET tape cartridge out and unprotected on top of a security cabinet in August 2006. Fortuitously\nfor Applicant, compromise was unlikely in that incident, given the information on the TOP SECRET\ncartridge could not be easily accessed without the proper software, and the office was locked during\nthe 15 minutes it was exposed with no security personnel in the office. While Applicant\u2019s\nwillingness to comply with his security obligations is unquestioned, this recent security violation\nraises substantial doubts about his ability to comply.\n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E2.2.1.\nApplicant\u2019s overwhelming workload, especially when he had responsibility for some 275 classified\nassets, is a factor that contributed to his violations, especially his failures to secure classified storage\ncontainers in 2001 and 2002 (see \u00b6 E2.2.1.2. The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation). However, Applicant\u2019s record of violations also spans most of his\nemployment with the defense contractor. Only two months into his job, he failed to lock a security\ncontainer. His latest violation comes after  nine years of experience in security, including about five\nyears as an information systems security officer,  one year after the SOR was issued, and despite his\ngoal of no future security violations (see \u00b6 E2.2.1.1. The nature, extent, and seriousness of the\nconduct; \u00b6 E2.2.1.3. The frequency and recency of the conduct). Steps taken by his employer\n(moving his classified storage container, reducing his classified holdings, prohibiting recall of items\nturned in to classified material control), have not proven to be successful in dealing with the root\ncause of the violations (see \u00b6 E2.2.1.6. The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent\nbehavioral changes). With Applicant still vulnerable to workplace distractions,  another security\n9\nincident cannot be ruled out (see \u00b6 E2.2.1.9. The likelihood of continuation or recurrence).\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR, as amended:\nParagraph 1.

His wife also became a U.S. citizen. Applicant\u2019s mother is a\npermanent resident of the U.S., living most of the time here, and his father now lives in Hong Kong,\nbut plans to move permanently to the United States. His sister is a  U. S. resident. None of his family\nmembers belong to, or are active with any government agency of Hong Kong.  They are not in a\nposition to be exploited by Hong Kong in a way that could force Applicant to choose between loyalty\nto these family members and his loyalty to the United States. Mitigation has been shown. Clearance\nis granted.   \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865\n(as amended by Executive Orders 10909, 11328 and 12829) and Department of Defense Directive\n5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992 (as amended by Change 4), issued a Statement of Reasons\n(SOR), dated September 28, 2006, to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make\nthe preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. DOHA recommended referral to an\nAdministrative Judge to conduct proceedings and determine whether clearance should be granted\nor denied.\nApplicant filed a notarized Response to the allegations set forth in the SOR, dated October\n5, 2006, and he requested a hearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge. On November 9, 2006,\nthe case was assigned to me to conduct a hearing, and pursuant to formal notice, dated December\n12, 2006, a hearing was conducted on January 3, 2007.\nAt the hearing, Department Counsel offered seven documentary exhibits (Government\nExhibits 1- 7) and no witnesses were called. Applicant offered four  documentary exhibits (Exhibits\nA-D) and offered his own testimony. The transcript (Tr) was received on January 10, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe SOR was based on Foreign Influence (Guideline B) concerns because of the foreign\nresidency and/or citizenship of close family members and foreign travel. The SOR contains three\nallegations, 1.a., through 1.c., under Guideline B. Applicant admitted SOR allegations 1.c., and\ndenied 1.a and 1.b. The admission is incorporated herein as a finding of fact. \nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including Applicant's\nAnswer to the SOR, the admitted documents, and testimony of Applicant, and upon due\nconsideration of that evidence, I make the additional findings of fact: \nApplicant is 38 years old. He is employed by a United States defense contractor that wants\nhim to have a security clearance.\n\n3\nApplicant was born in Hong Kong in 1968 and first came to the United States in 1986, at the\nage of 18, to enter a United States university. He received a Bachelor of Science Degree in Systems\nEngineering in 1990 and a Masters degree in Computer Science, both from United States\nuniversities.\nApplicant became a naturalized U. S. citizen in 2003. He is married to a Hong Kong born,\nnaturalized U. S. citizen, and they have no children. Her parents live in the United States. \n(Guideline B - Foreign Influence) \nThe Government alleges that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has immediate\nfamily members or people to whom he may be bound by affection or obligation, who are not citizens\nof the United States, or may be subject to duress. \nApplicant\u2019s parents are Hong Kong  citizens. They both have resident alien status from the\nU. S.   His mother resides most of the time in the United States, living for approximately a month\nin Hong Kong to receive medical care. His mother is retired.  His father still resides most of the year\nin Hong Kong, where he works part time as a security guard under a contract that expires at the end\nof 2007.   He plans to move to the U. S. permanently, when his contract term is completed.   Neither\nof his parents ever worked for, or had any affiliation with, the Hong Kong Government. \nApplicant has a sister, who was born in Hong Kong, but now lives in the United States. \nSince Applicant came to the United States, he has traveled to Hong Kong on four occasions\nfrom 1999 to his last visit in October 2006.  The primary reason for these visits was to see his family\nduring vacations, and the most recent visit was as part of his honeymoon.\nApplicant does not have any financial interest in Hong Kong, nor is he aware of the potential\nof receiving any inheritance there. He has owns his home in the United States and has additional\nfinancial holdings in this country. Applicant also testified that he has voted in the last three U.S.\nelections since he has become a citizen, and he plans to remain in the United States for the rest of\nhis life. \nFinally, Applicant testified that if pressure was exerted upon Applicant to compromise\nclassified information, he would resist it, and he would  report the incident to the proper authorities\n(Tr at 62-64).\nSince Applicant\u2019s father resides in Hong Kong at the present time, this country was also\nconsidered. Hong Kong is one of the world\u2019s most open and dynamic economies. On July 1, 1997,\nthe People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) resumed the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong, ending\nmore than 150 years of British Colonial rule. Hong Kong is a Special Administrative Region of the\nPRC, with a high degree of autonomy in all matters except foreign and defense affairs. Hong Kong\nwill retain its political, economic, and judicial systems and unique way of life for 50 years after\n\n4\nreversion and will continue to participate in international agreements and organizations under the\nname, \u201cHong Kong, China\u201d (Exhibit G).\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines that must be carefully\nconsidered in evaluating an individual's security eligibility and making the overall common sense\ndetermination required. The Administrative Judge must take into account the conditions raising or\nmitigating security concerns in each area applicable to the facts and circumstances presented.\nAlthough the presence or absence of a particular condition for or against clearance is not\ndeterminative, the specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be\nmeasured against this policy guidance, as the guidelines reflect consideration of those factors of\nseriousness, recency, motivation, etc. \nThe adjudication process is based on the whole person concept. All available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, is to be taken into account in reaching a decision as\nto whether a person is an acceptable security risk.\nEach adjudicative decision must also include an assessment of: (1) the nature, extent, and\nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, and the extent of\nknowledgeable participation; (3) how recent and frequent the behavior was; (4) the individual's age\nand maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or\nabsence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;\n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation\nor recurrence (See Directive, Section E2.2.1. of Enclosure 2).  \nBURDEN OF PROOF\nInitially, the Government must prove controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons.\nIf the Government meets that burden, the burden of persuasion then shifts to the applicant to\nestablish his security suitability through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient\nto demonstrate that, despite the existence of disqualifying conduct, it is nevertheless clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue the security clearance. Assessment of an\napplicant's fitness for access to classified information requires evaluation of the whole person, and\nconsideration of such factors as the recency and frequency of the disqualifying conduct, the\nlikelihood of recurrence, and evidence of rehabilitation.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with\nthe U.S. Government that is predicated upon trust and confidence. Where facts proven by the\nGovernment raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness, the applicant\nhas a heavy burden of persuasion to demonstrate that he or she is nonetheless security worthy. As\nnoted by the United States Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531\n(1988), \"the clearly consistent standard indicates that security-clearance determinations should err,\nif they must, on the side of denials.\"\n\n5\nCONCLUSIONS\nHaving considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal precepts and\nfactors, and having assessed the credibility of Applicant, I conclude the following with respect to\nGuideline B:\nBased on the evidence of record, the Government has established an initial reason to deny\nApplicant a security clearance because of Guideline B (Foreign Influence). Applicant\u2019s parents are\ncitizens of Hong Kong, and his father is still a resident there. The Hong Kong citizenship and\nresidency of Applicant's father creates the potential for foreign influence that could result in the\ncompromise of classified information because it makes Applicant potentially vulnerable to coercion,\nexploitation, or pressure. The possession of such ties raises a security concern sufficient to require\nApplicant to present evidence in rebuttal, extenuation, or mitigation sufficient to meet his burden\nof persuasion that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security\nclearance for him. This Applicant has done.\nThe evidence of existence of an immediate family member, who is a  citizen and resident of\nHong Kong comes within Disqualifying Condition (DC) 7 (a), contact with a foreign family member,\nif that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, pressure or coercion.\nI have reviewed the overall record and the totality of the evidence, and considered: the lack\nof Hong Kong government involvement of Applicant\u2019s parents, currently and in the past; the fact that\nhis wife is now a United States citizen; his mother and sister now live in the United States and his\nfather plans to reside here after 2007; his history since coming to the United States and living here\nhalf of his life, attending two universities and receiving two degrees; and his strong feelings\nconcerning this country. Based on this,  I have determined that his father in Hong Kong does not\nconstitute an unacceptable security risk and Mitigating Condition (MC) 8 (b), there is no conflict\nbecause the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that\nthe individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest, applies\nto this case.\n \n        \nAfter considering all of the evidence of record on Guideline B , I conclude that the mitigating\nevidence substantially outweighs the evidence supporting the SOR and even in the unlikely event\npressure was exerted upon Applicant to compromise classified information, he would resist it, and\nhe would, as he has testified,  report the incident to the proper authorities. \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nParagraph 1. Guideline B: FOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.: For Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.: For Applicant \n\n6\nSubparagraph 1.c.: For Applicant \nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nMartin H.

He supported military \noperations in Iraq on multiple occasions deploying with U.S. Army units. Applicant\u2019s \nsiblings are citizens and residents of Iraq. He has substantially more connections to the \nUnited States than to Iraq. After a thorough review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, \nand evidence, I conclude Applicant has rebutted or mitigated the government\u2019s security \nconcerns under Guideline B, foreign influence. Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is granted. \n \nStatement of Case \n \n \nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny or revoke his \neligibility for an industrial security clearance.

On March 3, 2008, I was assigned the case. On May 7, \n2008, DOHA issued a notice of hearing scheduling the hearing held on May 20, 2008. \nThe government offered Exhibits (Ex.) 1 and 2, which were admitted into evidence. \nApplicant testified on his own behalf and submitted Exhibits A through E, which were \nadmitted into evidence. The record was kept open to allow Applicant to submit \nadditional matters. On May 26, 2008 and May 29, 2008, additional documents were \nreceived. Department Counsel did not object to the material and it was admitted into \nevidence as Ex. F and G. On June 5, 2008, the transcript (Tr.) was received.  \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice \nof certain facts relating to Iraq. Applicant did not object to administrative notice. The \nrequest and the attached documents were not admitted into evidence but were included \nin the record as Hearing Exhibits (HEx) I\u2500VI.

Applicant was a dedicated \nand tireless worker who was willing to perform any assignment 24 hours a day. (Ex.

Because of the shortage of officers due to the Iraq/Iran war, the training period \n \nguidelines (AG) approved by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of \nDefense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n\n \n \n \n3\nwas reduced from three years to nine months. (Tr. 23) In 1991 was promoted to first \nlieutenant. In 1991, when Saddam invaded Kuwait, Applicant went home to southern \nIraq and did not participate in the war. (Tr. 25) In 1991 following the defeat of the Iraqi \nmilitary, Applicant joined the unsuccessful uprising against the Saddam Hussein regime. \n(Tr. 19) The uprising lasted two weeks before it was forcefully and brutally suppressed. \nFacing execution if caught, Applicant left the country by surrendering to coalition forces. \n(Tr. 77) He was 28 years old. (Tr. 49) When Applicant left Iraq he automatically lost his \nIraqi citizenship under Iraqi law. (Tr. 52)  \n \nApplicant stayed in a POW camp in Saudi Arabia for 17 months before coming to \nthe U.S. as a refugee in August 1992. (Tr. 19) In May 1998, he became a naturalized \nU.S. citizen. His parents are deceased. His father was a farmer and his mother a \nhomemaker. (Tr. 57, 58) In 1997, he married a native born U.S. citizen and they have \ntwo children born in the U.S., a boy age seven and a half and a girl age six. (Tr. 47, 81) \nApplicant has a U.S. passport, which is the only passport he has ever had. (Tr. 22, 50) \nApplicant has one younger sibling and six older siblings who are citizens and residents \nof Iraq. His youngest brother was imprisoned during the Saddam regime for taking part \nin the failed uprising. (Tr. 56, 70)  \n \nApplicant oldest brother owns a truck and his wife is a homemaker. (Tr. 59) \nAnother brother is missing from the 1980 Iraq/Iran war. (Tr. 61) It was reported that his \nbrother refused to go to war and was killed by Iraqi forces. (Tr. 61) Another brother is a \nretired clerk for a construction company run by the government. (Tr. 62) He has a \nbrother who is an unemployed truck driver and another who is a welder. (Tr. 67, 69) His \ntwo sisters are homemakers. Applicant\u2019s youngest brother was given a government job \nas a form of compensation for his imprisonment during the Saddam regime. (Tr. 70) \nApplicant talks with his siblings weekly. (Tr. 73)  \n \nHis nephews are a teacher, taxi driver, students, truck driver, security guard, \npolicemen, and auto parts store employee. (Tr. 60, 63-67) One nephew is presumed \ndeceased having been \u201ctaken by Saddam,\u201d meaning he disappeared during the \nSaddam regime. (Tr. 65) \n \n \nIn 2002 or 2003, Applicant, at the encouragement of the U.S. government, \nbecame a member of the Iraqi National Congress in Washington, D.C. The Iraqi \nNational Congress also had an office in London. He was contacted by the U.S. \nGovernment and asked if he was willing to assist in the change of regime in Iraq. (Tr. \n20) Applicant joined the Free Iraqi Forces to free Iraq and make it a better country. \nApplicant received training from the U.S. State Department and the U.S. Army in Texas \nand Hungary. (Tr. 30)  \n \nIn February 2003, Applicant graduated from the Free Iraqi Forces Training and \nhaving successfully completed all requirements of the Task Force Warrior Officer \nCandidate School, was promoted to first lieutenant. (Exs. A, B) The certification of \npromotion and was signed by a U.S. Army major general who was the Task Force \nWarrior Commander. (Ex. C) In February 2003, Applicant moved to Kuwait and started \n\n \n \n \n4\ntraining U.S. military personnel about Iraqi culture, language, and religion until March \n2003 when the war started.  \n \nAs the U.S. military moved into Iraq, Applicant was part of a U.S. Army civil \naffairs unit. (Tr. 31) In May 2003, Applicant finished his job with the Free Iraqi Forces, \nretuned to the U.S., and applied for a job as a translator. In August 2003, Applicant \nfinished his training as a translator and returned to Iraq to commence work with the U.S. \nmilitary units in Iraq. He and the U.S. forces he was with came under hostile fire and \nroad side bombs during their missions, which included missions in Fallujah. (Tr. 84) He \nworked as a translator until November 2003, when, on a trip to the market, he was shot \nand injured. (Tr. 20) He was immediately taken to a hospital before being transported to \nGermany and then transferred to Walter Reed in Washington, D.C. (Tr. 36, 37 \n \nFrom March 2004 to June 2004, Applicant returned to his job as translator in \nIraq. He returned to the U.S. to buy a house and in August 2004, was ready to return to \nIraq. At that time, he was asked to complete a new security application. His application \nwas rejected because he had siblings in Iraq. Applicant is anxious to return to Iraq to \nagain work with the U.S. military. (Tr. 86) \n \nApplicant owned a home in the U.S. with a fair market value of $147,000. (Tr. 44) \nHe has $4,000 in a 401 (k) retirement plan with his job. (Tr. 45) His bank accounts are \nlocated in the U.S. He owns no property outside of the U.S. \n \nIraq \n \nI take administrative notice of the following facts. Iraq is a constitutional, \nparliamentary democracy with a federal system of government. (Hex I) It is a republic \nwith a freely elected government led by a Prime Minister. (Hex I) The 2005 Iraqi \nConstitution guarantees all Iraqis basic rights in many areas. Iraq\u2019s legislative branch \nconsists of an elected Council of Representatives. Iraq\u2019s judicial branch is independent, \nand is under no authority but that of the law. The focus of the United States policy in \nIraq remains on helping the Iraqi people build a constitutional, representative \ngovernment that respects the rights of all Iraqis and has security forces capable of \nmaintaining order and preventing the country from become a safe haven for terrorists \nand foreign fighters. The ultimate goal is an Iraq that is peaceful, united, stable, and \ndemocratic, with institutions capable of providing just governance and security for all \nIraqis.  Iraq and the United States are allies  in the war against terrorism.  \n \nThe risk of terrorism directed against U.S. citizens and interests in Iraq remains \nextremely high. (Hex III) The Department of State continues to strongly warn U.S. \ncitizens against travel to Iraq, which remains very dangerous. (Hex V) There is credible \ninformation that terrorists are targeting civil aviation. All vehicular travel in Iraq is \nextremely dangerous. The government was only recently able to diminish violent \nattacks, using extensive implementation of better security measures. (Hex V) \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n5\n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \n\n \n \n \n6\n \n \nAnalysis \n \nForeign Influence  \n \nAG & 6 expresses the security concerns regarding foreign influence: \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism. \n \nApplicant\u2019s seven siblings are citizens and residents of Iraq. Applicant left Iraq \nfleeing the Hussein regime by going to a POW camp in Saudi Arabia. In 1992, he came \nto the U.S. as a refugee. In 1998, he became a naturalized U.S. citizen. He has been \ndeployed to Iraq twice, working with the U.S. military forces. His deployment was \ninterrupted when he was shot and had to be medically returned to the U.S. Once \nhealed, he returned to Iraq to complete his deployment. \n \nHaving considered all of the Foreign Influence disqualifying conditions, applicable \nconditions that could possibly raise a security concern are AG & 7(a) \u201ccontact with a \nforeign family member, business or professional associate, friend, or other person who \nis a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion\u201d and AG & 7(b) \n\u201cconnections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that create a potential \nconflict of interest between the individual=s obligation to protect sensitive information or \ntechnology and the individual=s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by \nproviding that information\u201d apply. \n \nThe new Iraqi government relies upon the U.S. for support as it moves forward \nwith its new form of government. While Iraq=s human rights record under Saddam \nHussein was very dismal and some problems continue, its human rights record is slowly \nimproving under the new government.  \n \nIn every case where a sibling lives overseas, there is a risk of pressure on this \nrelative and through them upon the holder of a security clearance. Under the facts of \nthis case, a heightened risk for exploitation, inducement, manipulation pressure, or \ncoercion is substantiated. However, Applicant has significant ties to the U.S. and few \nties to Iraq. While he still has seven siblings living in Iraq, he lives with his native born \nwife in the U.S. His two children were born in the U.S. He has no financial or property \n\n \n \n \n7\ninterests in Iraq. He owns a home in the U.S. and his ties with the U.S. are much \nstronger than his ties with Iraq. \n \nApplicant\u2019s work as an interpreter supported the U.S. military mission in Iraq. He \nworked long hours in austere conditions with an ever present risk of hostile fire and road \nside bombs. The Army holds his work in a combat zone high regard. He provided more \nthan language interpretation skills. He explained local cultural nuances and practices \nwhich greatly assisted the military in accomplishing its combat mission. During his time \nin Iraq, he worked very hard to help the Army and developed a high level of trust with \nthe Army.  \n \nApplicant has partially mitigated the concern related to family members in Iraq \nunder AG & 8(a) \u201cthe nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that \ncountry are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to \nchoose between the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government \nand the interests of the U.S.\u201d he has fully mitigated concerns under AG & 8(b) \u201cthere is \nno conflict of interest, either because the individual=s sense of loyalty or obligation to the \nforeign person, group, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such \ndeep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be \nexpected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d \n \nNone of Applicant siblings work for a foreign government and none are involved \nwith organizations which seek to harm the U.S. Some of his nephews are policemen \nand security guards. Applicant talks with his siblings, but has limited contact with his \nnieces and nephews. \n \nApplicant has no love for the former Iraqi regime, which killed one of his brothers, \na nephew, and another imprisoned his brother. He and his brother responded to the \nU.S. call to rise up against the former dictator of Iraqi. When that uprising failed, he \nwould have been executed if caught. When he left Iraq, he lost his Iraqi citizenship. \nApplicant again responded to the U.S. call to the change of regime in Iraq. He became a \nmember of the Iraqi National Congress in Washington, D.C. and joined the Free Iraqi \nForces to free Iraq and make it a better country. Applicant was trained by the U.S. State \nDepartment and the U.S. Army. Having completed all requirements of the Task Force \nWarrior Officer Candidate School, he was promoted to first lieutenant and started \ntraining U.S. military personnel about Iraqi culture, language, and religion.  \n \nHe was shot while in Iraq attached as a translator with the U.S. Army. There is \nlittle likelihood that Applicant will be placed in a position of having to choose between \nthe interests of the U.S. and a foreign entity. Likewise, because of his close ties and his \nloyalties to the U.S., including his wife and two children (all U.S. born citizens), he would \nresolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n8\n                                                          \nWhole Person Concept \n \nProtection of our national security is of paramount concern. Security clearance \ndecisions are not intended to assign guilt or to impose further punishment for past \ntransgressions. Rather, the objective of the adjudicative process is the fair-minded, \ncommonsense assessment of a person=s trustworthiness and fitness for access to \nclassified information. In reaching this decision, I have considered the whole person \nconcept in evaluating Applicant=s risk and vulnerability in protecting our national \ninterests. I considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s family ties to Iraq and the heavy burden \nan Applicant carries when he has family members in a foreign country.  \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \n \nIn the more than 17 years since he left Iraq, Applicant returned three times, each \ntime working closely with the U.S. military. First as a lieutenant in the U.S. backed Free \nIraqi Forces, then as a translator, and the third time when he returned to Iraqi as a \ntranslator following his recovery from his shooting. Because he guided the Army \npersonal on local customs and nuances related to the spoken word and responded very \nwell in highly dangerous situations, the Army views him as a valuable resource in \nhelping it achieve its mission in Iraq.2  \n \nWhile danger certainly exists for all who go to Iraq, Applicant and his siblings are \nin no greater danger than any other individual living and working in Iraq. The U.S. and \nIraq governments have developed a close and positive working relationship. Iraq \n \n2In ISCR Case No. 05-03846 at 6 (App. Bd. Nov.14, 2006), the Appeal Board recognized an \nexception to the general rule in Guideline B cases when \u201can applicant has established by credible, \nindependent evidence that his compliance with security procedures and regulations occurs in the context \nof dangerous, high-risk circumstances in which the applicant had made a significant contribution to the \nnational security . . . [and therefore he] can be relied upon to recognize, resist and report a foreign \npower=s attempts at coercion or exploitation.\u201d \n\n \n \n \n9\ndepends upon the U.S. to help in its fight to combat the developing insurgency and \nterrorist forces. The Iraq government is moving forward with democracy and developing \na rule of law, with the assistance of the U.S. \n \nApplicant has no love for the former brutal regime. The Hussein regime killed his \nbrother and nephew, imprisoned his brother, and he was able to escape the country \nonly by surrendering to the U.S. military and going to a POW camp. When he left Iraq, \nhe was no longer an Iraqi citizen. Frequently, Applicant has gone in harms way to assist \nthe U.S. Army in performing their duties in Iraq. He did this not once, but three times. \nThe only reason he is not there now is because he lost his clearance because of his \nsiblings living in Iraq. \n \nI have carefully weighed the evidence in favor of Applicant against the \ngovernment=s concerns about Applicant=s ability to protect classified information. I find \nthat there is little potential for Applicant to be pressured, coerced, or exploited because \nhe has siblings living in Iraq. Overall, the record evidence leaves me without questions \nor doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these \nreasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the foreign influence security concerns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a \u2013 1.b: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n_________________ \nCLAUDE R. HEINY II \nAdministrative Judge \n \n \n",

Her marijuana use increased in 1995, to at least\na monthly basis.6\nApplicant was hospitalized in 1996, after police responded to a domestic incident at her\nhouse. Applicant tested positive on a urine test administered for medical purposes. Applicant smoked\nmarijuana the day of the incident.7\nApplicant\u2019s husband passed away in about 1996. Her marijuana use declined after the death\nof her husband. Applicant smoked marijuana approximately 15 times from 1996 through December\n2004. Applicant used cocaine on two occasions, in about 1997, and again in about 2000.8\nApplicant was arrested for possession of marijuana in about July 2004. The marijuana was\ndiscovered in Applicant\u2019s vehicle during a traffic stop. Applicant and her passenger planned on\n\nItem 3; Item 7 at 5.\n9\nItem 7 at 3.\n10\nItem 4 at 8.\n11\nId.\n12\nItem 5 at 7.\n13\nItem 3; Item 7 at 7.\n14\n4\nsmoking the marijuana when they reached their destination. Charges were dismissed without a\nconviction.9\nApplicant generally had marijuana provided to her. She estimates that she purchased\nmarijuana on about ten occasions, and not since about 1996. On a few occasions, she purchased\nmarijuana, and split the costs with friends. Her friends would give Applicant their money for their\nshare, and Applicant would give them their share of the marijuana. Applicant never profited from\nany of these transactions.10\nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on June 5, 2000. Appellant answered\n\u201cNo\u201d to Questions 27 and 28. Question 27 asked:\nSince the age of 16 or in the last 7 years, whichever is shorter, have you illegally used\nany controlled substance, for example, marijuana, cocaine, crack cocaine, hashish,\nnarcotics (opium, morphine, codeine, heroin, etc.) amphetamines, depressants\n(barbiturates, methaqualone, tranquilizers, etc.) hallucinogenics (LSD, PCP, etc.), or\nprescription drugs?11\nQuestion 28 asked:\nHave you EVER illegally used a controlled substance while employed as a law\nenforcement officer, prosecutor, or courtroom official; while possessing a security\nclearance; or while in a position directly and immediately affecting the public\nsafety?12\nApplicant intentionally provided false answers to both of the above questions.\nApplicant submitted another security clearance application on March 11, 2002. Appellant\nagain answered \u201cNo\u201d to the identical Questions 27 and 28.  This was an intentional falsification.\n13\nApplicant provided false information about her drug abuse because of her fear of possible negative\nconsequences such as the loss of her clearance or her job.  \n14\nApplicant was interviewed by a Special Agent of the Defense Security Service for her\nbackground investigation. She provided a signed statement in February 2004. She discussed her\n\nItem 6 at 2.\n15\nItem 3; Item 7 at 2.\n16\nItem 7 at 6.\n17\nItem 3; Applicant\u2019s response to FORM.\n18\nDepartment of the Navy v.

She wrote, \u201cI have not had in my possession or used\nmarijuana since that . . . weekend.\u201d  This was an intentionally false statement, as addressed above.\n15\nApplicant states she has not used any illegal drugs since December 31, 2004. On several\noccasions between December 2004 and April 2005, Applicant was present when marijuana was\nbeing smoked. On more than one occasion, she passed a marijuana cigarette from one person to\nanother, without smoking the cigarette.16\nApplicant was re-interviewed in September 2005, and provided another statement. Regarding\nher future drug use, Applicant wrote:\nI am certain that I will not use hard drugs in the future. I cannot state that I will never\nuse marijuana again in the future. I agree with SA (-----) that perhaps there could be\nsituations in the future when I might smoke marijuana again. I cannot predict when\nI would smoke marijuana again, but given my past history, the fact that I\u2019ve smoked\nmarijuana as recently as 31 Dec 04, the fact that I know people who smoke marijuana\nsuch as . . . , etc., I might smoke it [a]gain in the future.17\nApplicant states she no longer associates with people who use marijuana. She spends much\nof her time with her grandchildren. She works on home improvements and volunteers. She also\nsubmitted evidence of positive job performance.18\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  As Commander in Chief, the President has\n19\n\u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine\nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person\naccess to such information.\u201d  The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to\n20\ngrant applicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  An applicant has the ultimate burden of\n21\ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his or her\nsecurity clearance. The clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations\n\nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).\n22\nId.; Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.2.\n23\nExec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7.\n24\n6\nshould err, if they must, on the side of denials.  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant\n22\nshould be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such\nsensitive information.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a\n23\ndetermination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not\nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a\nclearance.  \n24\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth potentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and\nmitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline. Additionally, each security clearance decision\nmust be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and\ncircumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the adjudicative process factors listed in the\nDirective and AG \u00b6 2(a).\nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those\nwhich would mitigate security concerns, are set forth and discussed in the conclusions section below.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards discussed above.\nI reach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the SOR.\nGuideline H: Drug Involvement\nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and because it\nraises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\nDrug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner that deviates from approved\nmedical direction. \nApplicant used marijuana and cocaine while holding a security clearance. She purchased\nmarijuana and shared it with friends. These actions raise Drug Involvement Disqualifying Conditions\n(DI DC) \u00b6 25(a) (any drug abuse), DI DC 22(c) (illegal drug possession, including cultivation,\nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia), and\nDI DC 25(g) (any illegal drug use after being granted a security clearance). She tested positive for\nmarijuana on a 1996 urine test. DI DC 25(b) (testing positive for illegal drug use) is applicable. In\nher September 2005 statement, Applicant failed to unequivocally state that she would never use\nmarijuana again. DI DC 25(h) (expressed intent to continue illegal drug use, or failure to clearly and\nconvincingly commit to discontinue drug use) is established.\n\n7\nThe Drug Involvement Mitigating Conditions (DI MC) to consider in Applicant\u2019s case are\nDI MC 26(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment), and DI MC 26(b) (a demonstrated intent not to abuse\nany drugs in the future, such as (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2)\nchanging or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; (3) an appropriate period of\nabstinence; (4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for any\nviolation).\nIn September 2005, Applicant would not commit to remaining drug-free. She now states that\nshe no longer associates with drug users, and that she will not use drugs in the future. There is no\nevidence that Applicant has used illegal drugs since December 2004. She admitted she continued to\nbe around marijuana until about April 2005, and she passed marijuana cigarettes without smoking\nthe marijuana. That is not marijuana use, but it does constitute marijuana possession. Applicant used\nmarijuana for many years, and cocaine on two occasions, while holding a security clearance. She lied\nabout her drug use on a number of occasions because she was afraid it might affect her clearance or\nher job. Applicant stopped using drugs in the past for several years, and then started again. I do not\nfind that Applicant has established DI MC 26(a). Applicant has submitted evidence that would, if\ncredible, support the application of DI MC 26(b). Based on Applicant\u2019s previous statements, and the\nconduct described below under the personal conduct conclusions, I find Applicant not credible.\nGuideline E: Personal Conduct\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to\ncomply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. Of special interest is any failure to\nprovide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other failure to\ncooperate with the security clearance process.\nApplicant intentionally failed to list her illegal drug use on her security clearance\nquestionnaires, and she provided false information on a statement for her background investigation.\nThis raises three Personal Conduct Disqualifying Conditions (PC DC). They are PC DC 16(a)\n(deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security\nquestionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine\nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or\ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities), PC DC 16(b) (deliberately providing false or\nmisleading information concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official,\ncompetent medical authority, or other official government representative), and PC DC 16(e)\n(personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, that creates a vulnerability\nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may\naffect the person\u2019s personal, professional, or community standing . . . ).\nApplicant\u2019s association with illegal drug users raises PC DC 16(g) (association with persons\ninvolved in criminal activity).\nI have considered all the Personal Conduct Mitigating Conditions (PC MC) and I especially\nconsidered PC MC 17(a) (the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission,\n\n8\nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts), PC MC 17(c) (the offense is\nso minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment), PC MC 17(d) (the individual has acknowledged the behavior\nand obtained counseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the\nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate\nbehavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur), PC MC 17(e) the individual has taken positive\nsteps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress), and PC MC\n17(g) (association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or occurs under\ncircumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, judgment,\nor willingness to comply with rules and regulations). \nApplicant lied about her drug use for many years in order to keep her security clearance. She\nfinally revealed her drug use. She states she has stopped using drugs and no longer associates with\npeople who do. PC MC 17(a) and PC MC 17(c) do not apply. PC MC 17(d) and PC MC 17(e) are\npartially applicable. PC MC 17(g) is applicable to SOR \u00b6 2(f).\nWhole Person Analysis\nThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is an acceptable security risk. Available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in\nreaching a determination. In evaluating Applicant\u2019s case, I have considered the adjudicative process\nfactors listed in the Directive and AG \u00b6 2(a). I have also considered all the evidence, and every\nfinding of fact and conclusion discussed above. \nApplicant used illegal drugs for many years while holding a security clearance. She lied on\nmany occasions in order to hide her drug use and keep her clearance. Applicant states she has not\nused illegal drugs since December 2004, and no longer associates with her drug-using friends and\nrelatives. She has remained drug free for several years in the past, and then went back to using drugs.\nEven if Applicant is now telling the truth, with her extensive history of drug abuse interrupted with\na lengthy period of sobriety, she cannot be trusted at this time to remain drug free. Additionally, with\nApplicant\u2019s extensive history of lying, it is difficult to accept anything she says at face value.\nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions and evaluating all the evidence\nin the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns\nbased on her drug abuse and personal conduct.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\n\n9\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.

Howry, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se\nMay 4, 2010\nDecision\nMOGUL, Martin H., Administrative Judge:\nOn July 31, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline E for\nApplicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR (RSOR) in writing on August 13, 2009, and\nrequested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. I received the case assignment on\nSeptember 21, 2009. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on November 16, 2009, and I\nconvened the hearing as scheduled on December 17, 2009. The Government offered\nExhibits 1 through 6, which were received and entered into evidence without objection.\nApplicant testified on his own behalf, and he submitted Exhibits A through F, which were\nalso received and entered into evidence without objection. At the request of Applicant,\nthe record remained open until January 4, 2010, to allow Applicant to offer post hearing\n\n2\ncharacter letters. A cover letter and 12 character letters were submitted, and have been\nentered into evidence without objection collectively as Exhibit G. DOHA received the\ntranscript of the hearing (Tr) on December 23, 2009. Based upon a review of the case\nfile, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is\ndenied.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his RSOR, Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations; 1.a. through 1.h.,\nunder Guideline E. The admitted allegations are incorporated herein as findings of fact. \nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including\nApplicant's RSOR, the admitted documents, and the testimony of Applicant, and upon\ndue consideration of that evidence, I make the additional findings of fact: \nApplicant is 54 years old. He is married, and he has three children. Applicant\nworks for a defense contractor, and he seeks a DoD security clearance in connection\nwith his employment in the defense sector.\n(Guideline E - Personal Conduct)\nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for\nclearance because he exhibited conduct involving questionable judgement, lack of\ncandor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations.\n1.a. Applicant executed a Security Clearance Application (SCA) on October 5,\n2006. (Exhibit 1.)  Question #24 a. of the SCA asked since the age of 16 or in the\nprevious seven years, whichever is shorter, had Applicant illegally used any controlled\nsubstance? Applicant answered \"Yes\" to this question, and he listed the use of\nmarijuana on one occasion in July 2000. The Government alleges, and Applicant has\nadmitted in his RSOR, that he should have disclosed his use of marijuana, a few times\nweekly, from at least 1999 until at least August 2000. \n1.b. Question 24 b. of Exhibit 1 asks whether Applicant had ever illegally used\nany controlled substance while possessing a security clearance. Applicant answered\n\"No\" to this question. The Government alleges, and Applicant has admitted in his\nRSOR, that he should have disclosed his use of marijuana, a few times weekly, until at\nleast August 2000, after he had been granted a Department of Defense Security\nClearance in approximately April 1997. \n1.c. Applicant executed a Security Clearance Application (SCA), on January 14,\n2003. (Exhibit 2.)  Question #24 a. of the SCA asked since the age of 16 or in the\nprevious seven years, whichever is shorter, had Applicant illegally used any controlled\nsubstance? Applicant answered \"Yes\" to this question, and he listed the use of\nmarijuana on five occasions in July 2000. The Government alleges, and Applicant has\nadmitted in his RSOR, that he should have disclosed his use of marijuana, a few times\n\n3\nweekly, from at least 1996 until at least August 2000, and his use of cocaine from at\nleast 1996 to at least 1997.  \n1.d. Question 24 b. of Exhibit 2 asks whether Applicant had ever illegally used\nany controlled substance while possessing a security clearance. Applicant answered\n\"No\" to this question. The Government alleges, and Applicant has admitted in his RSOR\nthat he should have disclosed his use of marijuana, until at least August 2000, after he\nhad been granted a Department of Defense Security Clearance in approximately April\n1997. \n1.e. Applicant executed a Security Clearance Application (SCA), on December \n5, 1996. (Exhibit 3.)  Question #24 a. of the SCA asked since the age of 16 or in the\nprevious seven years, whichever is shorter, had Applicant illegally used any controlled\nsubstance? Applicant answered \"No\" to this question. The Government alleges, and\nApplicant has admitted in his RSOR, that he should have disclosed his use of\nmarijuana, and cocaine from at least 1989 to at least 1996. \n1.f. Applicant used marijuana until at least August 2000 after he had been\ngranted a Department of Defense Security clearance in approximately 1997. In his\nRSOR, Applicant admitted this allegation. \n1.g. Applicant\u2019s access to Sensitive Compartmented Information was revoked in\n2001 by another Government Agency as a result of Applicant\u2019s drug usage. In his\nRSOR, Applicant admitted this allegation. \n1.h. Applicant was denied program access by the United States Air Force in\n2004, as a result of Applicant\u2019s drug usage and his failure to provide truthful answers\nduring security processing. In his RSOR, Applicant admitted this allegation.  Exhibit 6\nincludes a letter from the United States Air Force, dated Applicant 29, 2004, which\nexplained that Applicant was denied program access because of his failure, on multiple\noccasions, to furnish complete and truthful information about his drug usage. \nAt the hearing, Applicant testified that he first informed the Government of his\nmarijuana usage after he underwent a polygraph examination and was told that he\nfailed. Thereafter he confessed that he had used marijuana. He estimated that he used\nmarijuana once every two weeks from 1993 until 2000. (Tr at 37-41.) He also testified\nthat he used marijuana and cocaine more frequently in the 1980s. (Tr at 45.)\nApplicant conceded that he knew he had used drugs more frequently that what\nhe identified on the most current SCA (Exhibit 1 ). He stated, \u201cI don\u2019t really know why I\ndid it. I wanted to do a good job for the company. I wanted my Clearance. I admit it was\ntotally wrong.\u201d (Tr at 43.) He also admitted that when he completed the first SCA in\n1996, he was still using marijuana regularly, but he was afraid that if he was honest\nabout his drug usage, he would not get his clearance. (Tr at 60.)\n\n4\nMitigation\nApplicant submitted one character letter at the time of the hearing (Exhibit A) and\n12 additional letters post hearing, from individuals who have known him in different\ncapacities. (Exhibit G.) All of the letters were very positive in describing Applicant. Since\nit is not clear if any of them were aware of the nature and frequency of Applicant\u2019s drug\nusage, nor about his misrepresentations to the Government, I find their\nrecommendations to be of limited value. Applicant also submitted 12 Performance\nReviews from his previous and present employers. (Exhibits B through E.) They were\nconsistently positive and satisfactory. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\n\n5\nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline E - Personal Conduct \nWith respect to Guideline E, the evidence establishes that Applicant furnished to\nthe Government incomplete, untruthful answers regarding the extent of his drug\ninvolvement on three SCAs that he executed in 1996, 2003, and 2006. The record is\nclear that he was aware of true extent of his marijuana and cocaine usage, and that he\nknowingly failed to furnish that information to the Government so that he could receive\nand then maintain a Security Clearance. He also continued using illegal substances\nafter he received a Security Clearance. His dishonest conduct also continued while\nworking with the United States Air Force and with another Government agency. \nThe Government relies heavily on the honesty and integrity of individuals seeking\naccess to our nation\u2019s secrets. When such an individual intentionally falsifies material\nfacts, or fails to furnish relevant information to a Government investigator, it is extremely\ndifficult to conclude that he nevertheless possesses the judgment, and honesty\nnecessary for an individual given a clearance. In this case, I conclude that Applicant\nknowingly and willingly failed to give complete, honest answers regarding his drug\nusage to the Government.\nAG \u00b6 16 notes several conditions that could raise security concerns and could\npotentially apply in this case. I conclude that AG \u00b6 16. (a) applies because of Applicant\u2019s\ndeliberate omission, concealment, and falsification of relevant facts from three different\npersonnel security questionnaires, which were used to determine Applicant\u2019s security\nclearance eligibility. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns from Personal\nConduct.  I find that none of the Mitigating Conditions apply in this case.  \nApplicant\u2019s conduct, considered as a whole, exhibits questionable judgement,\nunreliability, and a lack of candor. I resolve Guideline E against Applicant.\n\n6\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2 (c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.      \nI have considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions under\nGuideline E, in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Based on\nall of the reasons cited above, including Applicant\u2019s long history of using marijuana and\ncocaine, especially after receiving a Security Clearance, and his lack of honesty and\ncandor with the information he furnished to the Government, I find that the record\nevidence leaves me with serious questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and\nsuitability for a security clearance under the whole-person concept. For all these\nreasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline E:\nAGAINST  APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.-1.h.:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n7\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \nMartin H. Mogul\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Applicant submitted\na timely appeal pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.  \n1\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s unfavorable security\nclearance decision under Guidelines H and E is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nApplicant argues that the Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance decision under Guideline H\nshould be reversed because Applicant\u2019s 30-year period of illegal marijuana use was \u201cinterspersed\nwith substantial periods of total abstinence.\u201d  As a result, Applicant\u2019s marijuana use was \u201cinfrequent\n[and] periodic\u201d rather than \u201csubstantial and frequent.\u201d   Applicant also argues that the Judge\u2019s\n2\nadverse security clearance decision under Guideline E should be reversed because Applicant\u2019s\nmultiple falsifications were the result of his \u201cnaivete\u201d and his \u201chaving failed to appreciate certain\nsignificant aspects of this matter,\u201d rather than a deliberate effort to mislead or not disclose\ninformation.   Applicant\u2019s arguments do not demonstrate that the Judge erred.\n3\nThe Judge had the opportunity to consider Applicant\u2019s explanation for why he failed to\ndisclose the information in question.  The Judge was not bound, as a matter of law, to accept or reject\nApplicant\u2019s explanation.  The Judge considered Applicant\u2019s explanation in light of the record\nevidence as a whole, and concluded there was a sufficient basis to find that Applicant\u2019s omissions\nwere deliberate and intentional.  On this record, the Judge\u2019s finding of deliberate falsification is\nsustainable.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  Applicant has not demonstrated that the Judge\u2019s conclusion\nin that regard is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.   \nThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions does not turn simply on a finding\nthat one or more of them applies to the particular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires\nthe exercise of sound discretion in light of the record evidence as a whole.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No.\n01-14740 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan.15, 2003).  Thus, the presence of some mitigating evidence does not\nalone compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the\nJudge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs\nthe unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of\nthe evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to\ndemonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.\nIn his decision, the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the\nlength and seriousness of the disqualifying conduct and considered the possible application of\nrelevant mitigating conditions.  He found in favor of Applicant with respect to two of the Guideline\nH allegations.  However, the Judge reasonably explained why the evidence which the Applicant had\n\n3\npresented in mitigation under Guidelines H and E was insufficient to overcome the government\u2019s\nsecurity concerns.  The Board does not review a case de novo.  Given the record that was before him,\nthe Judge\u2019s ultimate unfavorable clearance decision under Guidelines H and E is not arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.\nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge denying Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Jean E.

Murphy, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nSusan B. Martin,Esq.\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On August 3, 2005 DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\n\n2\nthe basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations)\npursuant to Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).\nApplicant requested a hearing.  On June 8, 2006, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Christopher\nGraham granted Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Department Counsel timely appealed\npursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.  \nDepartment Counsel raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Administrative Judge\ndiscussed and considered important evidence in his decision and whether the Judge\u2019s application of\nFinancial Considerations Mitigating Conditions 3, 4, and 6 was unsupported by the record evidence\nand was arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law.  We remand the Administrative Judge\u2019s decision\nto grant the clearance. \nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Factual Findings\nA. Facts \nThe total amount of indebtedness admitted to by Applicant and alleged in the SOR is\n$28,339.00.  Applicant had no medical insurance for seven years, and this accounted for a large\nnumber of delinquent medical accounts.  He was separated from his wife from January 2003 to\nOctober 2004.  While separated, he had custody of his children but his wife paid no child support.\nHe was unemployed for almost a year.  Applicant found employment that provided medical benefits\nin August 2003.  On September 14, 2005, Applicant began using the services of a financial\nconsultant to assist him manage his finances, pay creditors, and to help him analyze his spending to\nmake the best use of his income.  The debt service agreement consolidated $ 15, 239.00 of debts and\narranged settlements totaling $6,095.60 to be paid over 36 months.  On November 30, 2005, the\nagreement was modified to include additional creditors.  The additions increased the amount of debt\nenrolled in the debt service agreement to $22,276.00.  The financial consultant arranged settlements\nin the amount of $8,910.40, for a savings to Applicant of $13,365.60.  Applicant has also submitted\nhis monthly expenditures to his financial consultant for analysis.  In 2005, Applicant had\napproximately $9,789.00 in delinquent debt that was not included in the debt service agreement.\nAlso in 2005, Applicant had paid 4 debts totaling $281.00.\nApplicant\u2019s wife\u2019s employer now pays for their medical insurance.  Applicant was\nreimbursed $1,300.00 for a stolen computer and he used these proceeds to pay debts.  Applicant\u2019s\nlandlord reduced his rent by $50.00 per month and Applicant applied the difference toward a\nfurniture purchase.  These factors have increased Applicant\u2019s net income each month, money he will\nuse to pay debts.\nApplicant has 29 debts that have not been fully paid.\n  \nB. Discussion\nThe Appeal Board\u2019s review of the Administrative Judge\u2019s findings of fact is limited to\ndetermining if they are supported by substantial record evidence\u2014such relevant evidence as a\nreasonable mind might accept as adequate to support such a conclusion in light of all the contrary\nevidence in the record.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the\nevidence, and the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not\nprevent an administrative agency\u2019s finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d  Consolo\n\n3\nv. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620-21 (1966).  In evaluating the Administrative\nJudge\u2019s findings, we are required to give deference to the Administrative Judge\u2019s credibility\ndeterminations.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1. \nRegarding the Administrative Judge\u2019s factual findings, Department Counsel on appeal does\nnot assert that the Judge made erroneous factual findings.  Department Counsel does, however, assert\nthat there is record evidence comprising important aspects of the case that the Judge failed to\nmention or ignored in his decision.  Specifically, Department Counsel asserts that it was error for\nthe Judge not to mention or discuss the following: (a) the facts that Applicant had less than $400.00\nin the bank at the time of the hearing, lived \u201cpaycheck to paycheck,\u201d and had ongoing current debt\nobligations in addition to his sizable delinquent debt load; (b) a December 1, 2005 credit report\nindicating that Applicant still owed approximately $22,000.00 in delinquent debt; and (c) the fact\nthat Applicant has not actually made payments under his debt service agreement.  Department\nCounsel\u2019s arguments have mixed merit.\nThe decisions of Administrative Judge\u2019s are not held to a standard of perfection, and there\nis no requirement that a Judge discuss each and every piece of evidence in the record before him.\nHowever, the failure of a Judge to consider important aspects of the case is error.  With this concept\nin mind, the Board concludes that the Judge was not required to discuss the December 1, 2005 credit\nreport and its contents.  The Judge made findings that Applicant had a significant delinquent debt\nload of approximately the same magnitude and at approximately the same time as that described in\nthe credit report.  The contents of the credit report do not, therefore, significantly alter or supplement\nthe Judge\u2019s findings.  However, concerning Applicant\u2019s own description of his currently available\nfinancial resources, this was important evidence that the Judge should have enumerated and\ndiscussed.  The facts that Applicant has only about $400.00 in the bank, lives paycheck to paycheck,\nand has debt obligations in addition to his delinquent debt load are significant in that they tend to\nestablish that Applicant has limited means with which to address his substantial financial\ndelinquencies.  This evidence must be evaluated in making the ultimate determination whether\nApplicant has eliminated the government\u2019s security concerns.  It is additionally important for the\nJudge to discuss it in this case since the Judge gave considerable weight to the fact that Applicant\nhad increased his net income each month through a one time insurance payoff of $1,300.00 and a\n$50.00 per month reduction in rent.  Also, with regard to Applicant\u2019s debt service agreement,\nDepartment Counsel persuasively argues that it was error for the Judge not to mention the fact that,\nas of the close of the record, Applicant had yet to make any payments under the plan.  This was a\nserious omission in that a reading of the Judge\u2019s decision as a whole reveals that the Judge\u2019s overall\nfavorable security clearance decision was based in large part upon his finding that Applicant had\nentered into the debt repayment plan.  The fact that the Applicant had not actually made any\npayments under the plan is critical to an overall evaluation of the significance of the plan in\nalleviating the government\u2019s concerns.  Additionally, the Judge\u2019s failure to consider the fact that\nApplicant had no demonstrated track record of payment under the plan impacts his application of\nvarious Financial Considerations mitigating factors.  This issue will be discussed in subsequent\nparagraphs.\n  \nWhether the Record Supports the Administrative Judge\u2019s Ultimate Conclusions\nAn Administrative Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a\nsatisfactory explanation for\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found\nand the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins.\n\n\u201cThe conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment\n1\nor a death or divorce).\u201d\n\u201cThe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that the\n2\nproblem is being resolved or is under control.\u201d\n4\nCo., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983) (quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156,\n168 (1962)).  The Appeal Board may reverse the Administrative Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or\nrevoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.3.\nOur scope of review under this standard is narrow and we may not substitute our judgment for that\nof the Administrative Judge.  We may not set aside an Administrative Judge\u2019s decision \u201cthat is\nrational, based on consideration of the relevant factors, and within the scope of the authority\ndelegated to the agency. . .\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n, 463 U.S. at 42.  We review matters of law\nde novo.\nOn appeal, Department Counsel asserts that the Administrative Judge\u2019s application of\nFinancial Considerations Mitigating Conditions 3, 4,and 6 in the  \u201cConclusions\u201d section of his\ndecision was not supported by the record evidence and was arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law.\nFor the most part, Department Counsel\u2019s arguments have merit.\nAfter a review of the record evidence, the Board does not conclude that Financial\nConsiderations Mitigating Condition 3  could not be applied to the case as a matter of law.  There\n1\nis considerable record evidence establishing that much of Applicant\u2019s delinquent debt was acquired\nduring periods of illness and financial hardship under circumstances where Applicant had little or\nno control over the situation.  However, Department Counsel is correct in asserting that the Judge\u2019s\nanalysis under Mitigating Condition 3 was too narrow.  In evaluating the applicability and force of\nthis mitigating condition, the Judge must consider whether the Applicant dealt with his financial\ndifficulties in a reasonable manner.  ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at p. 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999).  The\nJudge\u2019s decision does not address the manner in which Applicant has dealt with those debts that\narose because of circumstances outside his control and whether or not Applicant\u2019s actions were\nreasonable.  Such omission was error.\nThe Administrative Judge\u2019s application of Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition\n4  is wholly dependent upon his analysis of Applicant\u2019s debt reduction plan.  On appeal, Department\n2\nCounsel does not challenge the conclusion that Applicant is receiving counseling for his debt\nproblems.  Department Counsel points out, however, that to satisfy the mitigating condition,\nApplicant must satisfy the \u201csecond prong\u201d of the Mitigating Condition and provide evidence of clear\nindications that the debt problems are being resolved or are under control.  ISCR Case No. 01-03695\nat 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002).  The Judge indicated that Applicant was working with his financial\nconsultant and that his financial delinquencies were being reduced.  While the record evidence\nestablishes that the delinquencies were being reduced to the extent that the debt reduction service\nreached agreements with some of Applicant\u2019s creditors to settle some debts for a reduced amount,\nthere is no evidence of debt reduction under the plan as a result of payments made by Applicant.\nWhile Applicant\u2019s activities under the plan arguably involve more than the mere \u201cpromise to pay\u201d\narticulated by Department Counsel, Department Counsel persuasively argues that the Judge\u2019s\nanalysis  is flawed because the Judge did not consider the extent of Applicant\u2019s actual compliance,\nor even his ability to comply with the agreement.  While the Board does not conclude that Mitigating\nCondition 4 is inapplicable to this case as a matter of law, the Judge must reevaluate its applicability\n\n\u201cThe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve bad debts.\u201d\n3\n5\nand force after taking into consideration the fact that Applicant has never made a payment under the\nplan and after considering evidence of Applicant\u2019s ability to reliably make payments on a long-term\nbasis.\nDepartment Counsel argues persuasively that the Administrative Judge\u2019s analysis of\nFinancial Considerations Mitigating Condition 6  was error.  As with his application of Mitigating\n3\nCondition 4, here the Judge relies exclusively on his analysis of the debt service agreement.  The\nJudge  makes reference to the \u201capparent success\u201d of the debt service agreement.  However, the record\nevidence regarding the debt settlement agreement does not support a finding that Applicant had made\nany payments into the plan by the time the record closed.  Absent a record of payment, the Judge\u2019s\nconclusion that the plan is an \u201capparent success\u201d has no basis in the record evidence.  Moreover, the\nBoard has held that until Applicant has a meaningful financial track record it cannot be said as a\nmatter of law that he has initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve\ndebts.  ISCR Case No. 01-21386 at 3 (App. Bd. June 11, 2003).  The phrase \u201cmeaningful track\nrecord\u201d necessarily includes evidence of actual debt reduction through payment on debts.  Therefore,\nthe Judge cannot rely on Applicant\u2019s debt service agreement as support for his conclusion that\nApplicant has initiated a good-faith effort for purposes of Mitigating Condition 6.  Because there is\nother record evidence that Applicant has made payments on debts, the Board does not conclude that\nMitigating Condition 6 does not apply as a matter of law.  The Judge should reevaluate the\napplicability of Mitigating Condition 6 in light of the record evidence as a whole and in light of the\nBoard\u2019s rulings in this case.\nConsidering the totality of the record evidence, the Board is not convinced that Applicant\nshould be denied a security clearance as a matter of law.  However, the errors in this case are not\nharmless.  Absent the errors pointed out in this decision, there is a significant chance that the\nAdministrative Judge could have reached a different result based upon the record as a whole.\nCompare, ISCR Case No. 00-0250 at 6 (July 11, 2001).  Accordingly, the case is remanded to the\nJudge for a new clearance decision in accordance with the Directive, Additional Procedural\nGuidance, \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.35 and E3.1.25.  Keeping in mind the Board\u2019s rulings, the new clearance decision\nshould address the issue of whether the evidence justifies application of the Financial Considerations\nmitigating conditions and whether the evidence reasonably supports an overall favorable decision.\n      \n Order\nThe judgment of the Administrative Judge granting Applicant a clearance is REMANDED.\nSigned: Jeffrey D. Billett       \nJeffrey D. Billett\nAdministrative Judge\nMember, Appeal Board\nSigned: Jean E. Smallin          \n\n6\nJean E. Smallin\nAdministrative Judge\nMember, Appeal Board\nSeparate Opinion of Member William S. Fields\nI think the Judge\u2019s decision in this case could be affirmed.  Department Counsel is essentially\narguing that the evidence shows that the Applicant was not as diligent about dealing with his\nfinancial problems as he could have been.  However, Department Counsel\u2019s disagreement with the\nJudge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, and his ability to argue for a different interpretation of that\nevidence, does not demonstrate that the Judge weighed or interpreted the evidence in a manner that\nis arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  \nIn this case, the Applicant reasonably established that his financial problems had their origin\nin circumstances beyond his control.  He also demonstrated that he had paid off some of the debts,\nhad begun using the services of a financial consultant, and had entered into a debt service agreement\nwhich consolidated most of the remaining indebtedness.  His actions in that regard resulted in the\nsettlement of some of the debts for substantially reduced amounts, a circumstance that resulted in\na measurable improvement in his financial situation.  Applicant was not required, as a matter of law,\nto establish the he had completely paid off his indebtedness.  See ISCR Case No. 02-25499 at 2\n(App. Bd. June 5, 2006).   \nSigned: William S.

On August 3, 2005 DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of 2 the basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) pursuant to Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).

Department Counsel timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. Department Counsel raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Administrative Judge discussed and considered important evidence in his decision and whether the Judge\u2019s application of Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions 3, 4, and 6 was unsupported by the record evidence and was arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law.

Facts The total amount of indebtedness admitted to by Applicant and alleged in the SOR is $28,339.00.

He has spent the last 21 years in the U.S. and is a loyal and dedicated U.S.\ncitizen.  Given the mitigating evidence submitted, and under the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept, Applicant\nhas mitigated security concerns pertaining to foreign preference and foreign influence because of his\nstrong connections to the U.S.  Under the specific facts in evidence, the government\u2019s security\nconcerns have been mitigated.  Clearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn May 2, 2003, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted a Security\nClearance Application (SF-86).   On November 3, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n1\n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating it was unable to find it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.   The\n2\nSOR, which is in essence the administrative complaint, alleges security concerns under Guideline\nB (foreign influence) and Guideline C (foreign preference).  \nOn November 22, 2005, Applicant responded to the SOR, and submitted his case for decision\nwithout a hearing.  By an undated facsimile, Applicant amended his answer and requested that his\ncase be decided by a hearing, and his request was approved by Director, DOHA.  On February 16,\n2006, Applicant further amended his Answer to SOR, which was received by DOHA on February\n21, 2006.  On March 31, 2006, Department Counsel filed a ready to proceed letter.  \nOn April 10, 2006, the hearing office received the case and it was assigned to another\nadministrative judge.  On June 5, 2006, Applicant\u2019s counsel submitted his notice of appearance.  On\nJune 19, 2006, the case was reassigned to me due to caseload considerations.  On August 9, 2006,\nDOHA issued a notice of hearing, scheduling the hearing for August 24, 2006.  The hearing\ncommenced and was completed on the scheduled date.\nThe government submitted nine documents that were marked as Government Exhibits (GE\n1 through 9), and were admitted into the record without objection.  Applicant credibly testified and\nsubmitted eight documents that were marked as Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AE) A through H.  Department\nCounsel objected to AE G, which I overruled, and the remaining documents were admitted into the\nrecord without objection.  \nOn September 6, 2006, DOHA received the transcript.  I held the record open to afford both\nparties the opportunity to submit additional evidence.  On September 8, 2006, Applicant submitted\neight additional documents that were marked as AE I through P.  AE I through L are DOHA\nAdministrative Judge cases favorable to Applicant\u2019s position.  On October 16, 2006, Department\nCounsel forwarded Applicant\u2019s additional documents to me indicating he had no objection to AE\n\n3\nI through L, but did object to AE M through P, if they were being admitted for administrative notice\npurposes.  I admitted AE I through P, and AE M through P were admitted for the limited purpose\nof providing additional argument to Applicant\u2019s position.  I took administrative notice of the\ninformation contained in GE 5 through 9, and AE F through H.  See discussion under Procedural\nMatters, infra.\nPROCEDURAL MATTERS\nAt the hearing, Department Counsel asked me to take administrative notice of Government\nExhibits 5 to 9, U.S. Department of State, Background Note: Egypt, September 2005; U.S.\nDepartment of State, Consular Information Sheet, Egypt, January 18, 2006; U.S. Department of\nState, Country Reports on Human Rights Practices - 2004, February 28, 2005; U.S. Department of\nState, Dual Nationality, January 18, 2006; and U.S. State Department, Office of the Coordinator for\nCounterterrorism, Country Reports on Terrorism 2004, April 2005, respectively.  \nAdditionally, Applicant submitted AE F to H, which are duplicate or additional documents,\nand I considered them for administrative notice as well.  Duplicate documents are AE F (GE 6) and\nAE H (GE 5).  Additional documents are National Counterintelligence Center, Annual Report to\nCongress on Foreign Economic Collection and Industrial Espionage, 1999; U.S. Department of\nState, Background Note: United Arab Emirates, February 2006 (AE I); The Office of the United\nStates Trade Representative, United States to Begin Free Trade Negotiations This Week with the\nUnited Arab Emirates and Oman, March 8, 2005 (AE J); The White House press release, The United\nStates \u2013 UAE Bilateral Relationship, February 22, 2006 (AE K); U.S. Department of State, Secretary\nRice Meets With Leaders of the United Arab Emirates, February 23, 2006 (AE L); and U.S.\nDepartment of State, United Arab Emirates, 2005 Investment Climate Statement \u2013 United Arab\nEmirates (AE M).\nAdministrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for administrative\nproceedings.  See ISCR Case No. 02-24875 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No.\n02-18668 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2004); McLeod v. Immigration and Naturalization  Service, 802\nF.2d 89, 93 n.4 (3d Cir. 1986)).  The most common basis for administrative notice at ISCR\nproceedings is to notice facts that are either well known or taken from government reports. See Stein,\nADMINISTRATIVE LAW, Section 25.01 (Bender & Co. 2006) (listing fifteen types of facts for\nadministrative notice).  Applicant did not object to my consideration of Exs. I to IX for purposes of\nadministrative notice. Tr. 15-33. \nFollowing the presentation evidence, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR by\nadding the following additional allegation under Guideline B:\n2.f. Your sister and her husband are citizens of Egypt and residents of the United Arab\nEmirates.\n\nGE 1, supra n. 1, section 1.1, at 1.\n3\nAssistant Secretary of Defense Memorandum, dated August 16, 2000, for Secretaries Of The Military\n4\nDepartments, et al, SUBJECT: Guidance to DoD Central Adjudication Facilities (CAF) Clarifying the Application of\nthe Foreign Preference Guideline, commonly known as the \u201cMoney Memorandum\u201d states in part the possession or use\nof a foreign passport may be a disqualifying condition unless sanctioned by the U.S. government.  The Memorandum\nfurther stated that any clearance be denied or revoked unless the applicant surrenders the foreign passport.  GE 5.\n4\nI allowed Department Counsel\u2019s motion to amend over Applicant\u2019s objection.  Applicant\u2019s\ntestimony provided the basis for the amendment to the SOR.  Both parties were given additional time\nto present additional evidence, discussed supra.   \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nIn his Answer and Amended Answer, Applicant admitted in part several of the SOR\nallegations. His admissions are incorporated into my findings, and after a thorough review of the\nrecord, I make the following additional findings of fact:\nApplicant testified and I found his testimony credible.  Applicant is 44 years old.   He was\n3\nborn and raised in Egypt.  Applicant went to a large university in Alexandria, Egypt, and was\nawarded a BSC degree in electrical engineering in May 1986.  In 1986, at age 24, he immigrated to\nthe U.S. for \u201ceconomic improvement\u201d with the intent of becoming a U.S. citizen.  Tr. 23.  Applicant\nbecame a naturalized U.S. citizen in January 1994, and has held a U.S. passport since February 1994.\nGE 1.\nAfter arriving in the U.S., he secured employment primarily in food service-related ventures\nand, in particular, working in and/or owning businesses that sold bagels.  While a co-owner of a\nbagel shop, Applicant met and developed a rapore with one of his patrons, the president and chief\nexecutive officer (CEO) of his current employer.  The CEO subsequently offered Applicant a\nposition as a systems designer where he has been continuously employed since May 2002.  Applicant\nis a first-time applicant for a security clearance.  There were no allegations of security violations\nagainst him, or negative judicial involvement.  \nApplicant possessed an Egyptian passport issued to him in May 1992, which was the only\npassport he was eligible to have until he became a U.S. citizen in January 1994.  His Egyptian\npassport expired in May 1999 (SOR \u00b6 1.b.).   When his passport expired, he did not renew it, and\n4\ndid not have any other foreign passport.  Subsequently, Applicant returned his expired Egyptian\npassport to the Egyptian Embassy.  Tr. 11, 81, 137, Answer to SOR.  Applicant also held dual\ncitizenship as an Egyptian as a result of birth in Egypt to Egyptian parents (SOR \u00b6 1.a.).  In addition\nto the oath Applicant took when he became a U.S. citizen, he took the additional affirmative step of\nrenouncing his Egyptian citizenship in a sworn statement.  Tr. 36-39, Answer to SOR.  The SOR\nalleged Applicant retained his Egyptian passport in order to eliminate Egyptian visa requirements\n(SOR \u00b6 1.c.).  Applicant denied this allegation and following Applicant\u2019s denial, the government did\noffer any evidence to rebut Applicant\u2019s denial.\nApplicant\u2019s 68-year-old mother is an Egyptian citizen and a permanent resident of the U.S.\nAfter receiving her \u201cgreen card\u201d in 1994, she moved to the U.S. and resides with Applicant and his\n\n5\nfamily (SOR \u00b6 2.a).  Tr. 101.  In August 2000, Applicant\u2019s mother applied to become a U.S. citizen.\nAE A.  Applicant\u2019s mother has completed all aspects of the application process to become a U.S.\ncitizen except for meeting the English reading, speaking, and writing requirements.  AE A.\nAlthough she failed the English literacy requirement portion of her citizenship examination, she\nremains determined to overcome this shortcoming as evidenced by her having completed an\nintensive English study course.  AE A.  Applicant\u2019s mother was a housewife her entire adult life.\nHer husband, Applicant\u2019s father, passed away in 1974.  She receives a small widow\u2019s pension from\nher late husband\u2019s employer, an Egyptian insurance company.  Applicant\u2019s mother is not politically\naffiliated with or connected in any way with the Egyptian government.  Tr. 45.\nApplicant was previously married from February 1990 to August 1994.  That marriage ended\nby divorce.  He has been married to his second and current wife since October 1994.  Applicant\u2019s\nsecond marriage was an \u201carranged\u201d marriage by his mother.  Tr. 46.  Applicant\u2019s wife is Egyptian\nborn, and became a U.S. citizen in October 1991.  GE 1.  Applicant\u2019s wife was trained as an\naccountant, but is currently a housewife caring for their four U.S. born minor children.  Tr. 94-95.\nSince arriving in the U.S., Applicant traveled to Egypt on four separate occasions (SOR  \u00b6\n2.c.).  In 1994, Applicant\u2019s visit to Egypt was for the purpose of getting married.  In 1995, Applicant\nvisited Egypt for the purpose of visiting his dying grandmother.  In 2004, Applicant\u2019s current\nemployer sent him to Egypt on a one-week company sponsored trip.  In 2005, Applicant\u2019s current\nemployer sent him to Egypt on a company sponsored trip a second time to deliver a work-related\nreport at a conference.  AE E.  Applicant used his U.S. passport on all four of these visits to Egypt.\nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law, father-in-law, sister-in-law, and brother-in-law are resident\ncitizens of Egypt (SOR \u00b6 2.b).  Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law is the general manager for a private\ncompany that makes pipeline tubes.  Tr. 49.  His father-in-law is a retired systems engineer, who was\nemployed by a private company.  Tr. 48.  Applicant\u2019s sister-in-law lives with her parents and is\nemployed as an accountant with the same company as her mother. Tr. 51.  Applicant\u2019s brother-in-law\nalso lives with his parents and just completed high school and plans to go to college.  Tr. 52.\nApplicant\u2019s father-in-law has never visited his family in the U.S. since he and his wife were married,\nand his mother-in-law visited his family in the U.S. one time approximately one year after they were\nmarried in 1995.  Tr. 53.  Applicant\u2019s wife visited her family in Egypt twice since they were married\nin 1994.  Tr. 54.  Applicant\u2019s contact with his in-laws averages approximately three telephone calls\nper years, typically on holidays, when his wife initiates calls to her family.  Tr. 54.  Applicant\nestimates that his wife telephones her family approximately four times a year.  Tr. 54.  \nApplicant\u2019s sister and brother-in-law are citizens of Egypt and residents of the United Arab\nEmirates (UAE) (SOR \u00b6 2.f.).  His sister is employed as a dentist and his brother-in-law is employed\nas an accountant for a private oil company.  Applicant last saw his sister in November 2005 when\nhe was visiting the UAE on a work-related and funded trip to the UAE.  Tr. 84.  Applicant estimates\nhe speaks to his sister on the telephone approximately two to three times a year.  Tr. 85.  Neither\nApplicant\u2019s sister or brother-in-law are employed by or associated with the Egyptian or UAE\ngovernments.  \nApplicant\u2019s wife does not know the specific nature of his work nor does he discuss his work\nwith her.  Tr. 56.  Applicant\u2019s in-laws in Egypt do not know the nature of his work.  When Applicant\n\n6\ntraveled to Egypt in 2004 and 2005 on his company sponsored trips, he stayed in a hotel and did not\nvisit his in-laws.  Tr. 58.  \nApplicant has received extensive security training from his company which covered the\nprocedures to follow if contacted or approached by a foreign national.  In this regard, Applicant was\napproached by an individual from Morocco while on a company sponsored trip and this individual\nasked him to subscribe to two U.S. trade magazines on his behalf.  Applicant became uncomfortable\nwith this request and promptly reported the request to his company president.  This contact was\nreported to the FBI, who investigated this contact, and took no further known action.  Tr. 61.  \nBefore beginning employment with his current employer, Applicant closed down his bagel\nbusiness in 2002.  As part of the liquidation process and as part of his responsibilities, he transferred\nthe remaining share of  $1,500.00 to $2,000.00 to one of his former business partners, who happened\nto be vacationing in Egypt (SOR \u00b6 2.d.).  Tr. 62-63, 97, 109.  This transfer took place at the request\nof his former business partner.\nApplicant sent $2,000.00 to a U.S. citizen friend\u2019s father in Egypt for his medical care in\n2001 (SOR \u00b6 2.e.).  His friend\u2019s father needed $2,000.00 immediately to get admitted to a hospital.\nHis friend was at work and had forgotten to take his wallet with his credit card, otherwise his friend\nwould have sent the money himself on his father\u2019s behalf.  Applicant accommodated his friend under\nthese circumstances and his friend\u2019s father was admitted to the hospital.  His friend promptly repaid\nApplicant and that was the extent of Applicant\u2019s involvement with this money transfer.  Tr. 66-68.\nOther than these two self-reported money transfers, Applicant has never sent any other funds to\nEgypt.  Tr. 69, 109-111.\nApplicant has no assets in Egypt.  He and his wife rent a home in the U.S, and own two\nautomobiles.  Applicant and his wife exercise their right to vote in the U.S., pay taxes, and exercise\nall rights and privileges of being U.S. citizens.  Tr. 103.  Applicant\u2019s wife is actively involved with\nschool activities for their four children.  Tr. 104.  He further testified he would promptly report any\ncontacts of any kind from a foreign government to the proper authority.  He testified credibly of his\nloyalty to the U.S. and how proud he was to be involved in the type of work he does as a defense\ncontractor. \nApplicant provided one work-related reference letter from a colleague, who is a retired Air\nForce Officer having served as a Security Forces Officer.  This letter was quite compelling in\ndescribing Applicant\u2019s character and trustworthiness concluding that Applicant \u201cis one of the most\nhonorable people I have ever met.\u201d  AE C.\nThe president and CEO of Applicant\u2019s company, who holds a top secret clearance,  testified\non his behalf.  The CEO stated that Applicant was given a pay raise based on his work performance\nthat his company is \u201cvery, very satisfied with [Applicant\u2019s] dedication, commitment and . . . high\nintegrity to the organization.\u201d Tr. 116.  The CEO added that he would trust Applicant \u201cwith anything\nthat we have in the company,\u201d and that Applicant needed a security clearance to perform the duties\nrequired of him.  Tr. 116.  The CEO stated Applicant is held in very high regard by company\nemployees, and is very reliable and trustworthy. \n\n7\nAs indicated, supra, the government and Applicant offered documents prepared by the U.S.\nGovernment on Egypt and the UAE.  The collective evidence discusses the strong and friendly\nrelationship the U.S. enjoys with Egypt and the UAE.  These documents, GE 5 to 9 and AE F to M,\ndiscuss a range of topics pertaining to those two countries, which I considered in their entirety. \nPOLICIES\nIn an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s security suitability, an administrative judge must consider\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive, which sets forth adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief\nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines are divided into\ndisqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC), which are used to determine an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, an administrative judge should apply these guidelines in\nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process provision in Section E2.2, Enclosure\n2, of the Directive.  An administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and\ncommon sense decision.  \nBecause the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept,\u201d an administrative judge should consider all available, reliable information\nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision.\nSpecifically, an administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at\nDirective \u00b6 E2.2.1: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of\nthe conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness\nof participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes;\n(7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress;\nand (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those\nwhich could mitigate security concerns pertaining to the relevant adjudicative guidelines are set forth\nand discussed in the Conclusions section below.  Since the protection of the national security is the\nparamount consideration, the final decision in each case is arrived at by applying the standard that\nthe issuance of the clearance is \u201cclearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d In reaching\nthis decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the\nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere\nspeculation or conjecture.\n\n\u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a\n5\nconclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006)\n(citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1).  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing\ntwo inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial\nevidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966).  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a\nscintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v.Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4  Cir. 1994).\nth\n?The Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and unfavorable,\n6\n[evaluates] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the Directive, and [decides]\nwhether Applicant [has] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App.\nBd. July 6, 2006). \n8\nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d   The\n5\ngovernment initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a potentially disqualifying\ncondition under the Directive. Once the government has produced substantial evidence of a\ndisqualifying condition, the burden shifts to the applicant to produce evidence and prove a mitigating\ncondition.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 provides, \u201cThe applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and\nother evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by\nDepartment Counsel, and [applicant] has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a\nfavorable clearance decision.\u201d  The burden of disproving a mitigating condition  never shifts to the\ngovernment.  See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).6\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with\nthe government predicated upon trust and confidence. It is a relationship that transcends normal duty\nhours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is because of this special relationship the\ngovernment must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to\nwhom it grants access to classified information.  Decisions under this Directive include, by necessity,\nconsideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible\nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\nThe scope of an administrative judge\u2019s decision is limited. Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty,\nand patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings.  Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically\nprovides industrial security clearance decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall\nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  Security clearance\ndecisions cover many characteristics of an applicant other than allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism.\nNothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or\nin part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.\nCONCLUSIONS\nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate legal\nprecepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly above, I conclude the following\nwith respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR:\nGuideline C - Foreign Preference\n\nSee fn 4, supra.\n7\n9\nUnder Guideline C, a security concern may exist when an individual acts in such a way as\nto indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to\nprovide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.\nDirective E2.A3.1.1.\nForeign Preference Disqualifying Condition (FP DC) 1.  The exercise of dual citizenship; and\nFP DC 2: Possession and/or use of a foreign passport; are acts that demonstrate a foreign preference.\nAt the time the SOR was issued, Applicant held dual citizenship by birth in Egypt to Egyptian\nparents, and he held an expired Egyptian passport.  Applicant has formally renounced his Egyptian\ncitizenship and surrendered his expired Egyptian passport to the Egyptian Embassy.  These acts\npermit application of Foreign Preference Mitigating Condition (FP MC) 4: Individual has expressed\na willingness to renounce dual citizenship, and demonstrate full compliance with the Money\nMemorandum.   Applicant has not only met applicable mitigating conditions in effect at the time his\n7\nSOR was issued, he has exceeded them.\nGuideline B - Foreign Influence\nUnder Guideline B, a \u201csecurity risk may exist when an individual\u2019s immediate family,\nincluding cohabitants, and other persons to whom he or she may be bound by affection, influence,\nor obligation are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress.  These situations could\ncreate the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified\ninformation. Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial interests in other countries are also\nrelevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion,\nexploitation, or pressure.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E2.A2.1.1.\nThis allegation is based on the fact that Applicant\u2019s Egyptian citizen mother lives with his\nfamily, that he has Egyptian citizen in-laws living in Egypt, that he has an Egyptian sister and\nbrother-in-law living in the UAE, that he took four trips to Egypt in 1994, 1995, 2004, and 2005, and\nthe fact he sent money on two occasions to Egypt to a former business partner in 2002  and on behalf\nof a friend\u2019s father to cover his hospital admission costs in 2001.\nTwo of eight possible foreign influence disqualifying conditions (FI DC) could raise a\nsecurity concern in this case.  FI DC 1 applies where an \u201cimmediate family member, or a person to\nwhom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present\nin, a foreign country.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E2.A2.1.2.1. \u201cImmediate family members\u201d include a spouse,\nfather, mother, sons, daughters, brothers, and sisters.  Directive \u00b6 E2.A2.1.3.1. Although Applicant\u2019s\nin-law are not \u201cimmediate family members\u201d as defined by the Directive, they can be said to be\nindividuals with whom he has \u201cclose ties of affection or obligation.\u201d  The government produced\nevidence to establish FI DC 1 because Applicant\u2019s in-law are Egyptian citizens currently living in\nEgypt with whom he has occasional contact.  Also, Applicant has an Egyptian sister and brother-in-\nlaw living in the UAE.  \nFI DC 2 applies when \u201csharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of their\ncitizenship status, if the potential for adverse foreign influence or duress exists.\u201d  Directive \u00b6\nE2.A2.1.2.2.  The fact that Applicant\u2019s mother is an Egyptian citizen living with his family raises\n\nDirective, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.14.\n8\nDirective, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.15.\n9\nISCR Case No. 99-0597 (December 13, 2000).\n10\nCompare ISCR Case No. 03-10954 (App. Bd. Mar. 8, 2006); with ISCR Case No. 03-10312 at 6-9 (A.J. May\n11\n31, 2006); ISCR Case No. 02-21927, 2006 DOHA Lexis 229, at *15-*45 (A.J. May 17, 2006) (discussing the parameters\nand application of FI MC 1, especially the scope and definition of \u201cagent of a foreign power\u201d).  50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1801(b)\ndefines \u201cagent of a foreign power.\u201d The statutory definition for \u201cagent of a foreign power\u201d was explicitly included in\nExecutive Order 12968, Aug. 2, 1995, Part 1.1f, which established, \u201ca uniform Federal personnel security program for\nemployees who will be considered for initial or continued access to classified information.\u201d  The Appeal Board\u2019s\ndecision in ISCR Case No. 04-00540 at 6 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2007) reiterating the broad definition of \u201cagent of a foreign\n10\nthis as a potential concern.  Noteworthy, is the fact Applicant\u2019s mother moved to the U.S. in 1994\nand in 2000 applied for U.S. citizenship.  Apart from failing the English literacy portion of her\ncitizenship examination, she has done everything required to become a U.S. citizen.  Regarding the\nEnglish literacy requirements, she has also taken an intensive course in English to meet this\nrequirement.\nAlthough, the mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not,\nas a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B, if only one relative lives in a foreign country,\nand an applicant has contacts with that relative, this factor alone is sufficient to create the potential\nfor foreign influence and could potentially result in the compromise of classified information.  See\nISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8,\n2001).  Because FI DCs and 1 and 2 apply, Applicant has the burden to present evidence of rebuttal,\nextenuation or mitigation to show that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant her\na security clearance. \nOnce the government meets its burden of proving controverted facts  the burden shifts to an\n8\napplicant to present evidence demonstrating extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances.9\nFurther, the government is under no duty to present evidence to disprove any Adjudicative Guideline\nmitigating conditions, and an administrative judge cannot assume or infer that any particular\nmitigating condition is applicable merely because the government does not present evidence to\ndisprove that particular mitigating condition.10\nSecurity concerns based on foreign influence can be mitigated by showing the applicability\nof one or more foreign influence mitigating conditions (FI MC).  FI MC 1 recognizes that security\nconcerns are reduced when there is \u201c[a] determination that the immediate family member(s), (spouse,\nfather, mother, sons, daughters, brothers, sisters), cohabitant, or associate(s) in question are not\nagents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could\nforce the individual to choose between loyalty to the person(s) involved and the United States.\u201d\nDirective \u00b6 E2.A2.1.3.1.  Notwithstanding the facially disjunctive language of FI MC 1, the Appeal\nBoard has decided that Applicant must prove that his family members, cohabitant or associates are\nnot agents of a foreign power, and are not in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way\nthat could force Applicant to chose between the person(s) involved and the United States.  ISCR\nCase No. 02-14995 at 5 (App. Bd. July 26, 2004).  Applicant satisfies the first prong of FI MC 1\neven under the Appeal Board\u2019s very broad definition of \u201cagent of a foreign power.\u201d  Also, the\n11\n\npower\u201d does not address why Executive Order 12968 is not controlling. See ISCR Case No. 04-03720 at 4 (App. Bd.\nJune 14, 2006); ISCR Case No. 04-02233 at 3 (App. Bd. May 9, 2006), see generally Nickelson v. United States, 284\nF.Supp.2d 387, 391 (E.D. Va. 2003) (requiring agency to follow own rules in security clearance determinations); ISCR\nCase No. 04-12648 at 10-13 (App. Bd. Oct. 20, 2006) (Harvey, J., dissenting) (explaining limitations on Appeal Board\u2019s\nauthority to reverse). \nSee ISCR Case No. 03-17071 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 22, 2006), see also ISCR Case No. 02-2454 at 4-5 (App.\n12\nBd. June 29, 2004) (employee of a city government was an \u201cagent of a foreign power\u201d). \nISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 6 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005) (quoting ISCR Case No. 00-0317 at 6 (App. Bd. Mar.\n13\n29, 2002)).\nThe Appeal Board has not increased an applicant\u2019s burden of persuasion in cases involving contacts with\n14\nfamily members living in Israel.  This situation may be compared to the Appeal Board\u2019s decision to place a \u201cvery heavy\nburden of persuasion\u201d on applicants to demonstrate that contacts with immediate family members living in Iran do not\npose a security risk. See ISCR Case No. 02-13595 at 3 (App. Bd. May 10, 2005) (stating an applicant has \u201ca very heavy\nburden of persuasion to overcome the security concerns\u201d when parents and siblings live in Iran); ISCR Case No. 04-\n11463 at 4 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (articulating \u201cvery heavy burden\u201d standard when applicant\u2019s family members live\nin Iran).   \nAnother less significant reason not to apply FI MC 1 is the history of terrorist activity in Israel.  The Appeal\n15\nBoard has limited the applicability of FI MC 1 where there is a history of terrorist activity in the foreign country in\nquestion.  ISCR Case No. 03-22643 (App. Bd. Jun. 24, 2005); ISCR Case No. 02-22461 at 5 (App. Bd. Oct. 22, 2005).\n11\nAppeal Board has specifically indicated that receipt of a foreign pension does not cause a person to\nbe an agent of a foreign power.    \n12\nThe second prong of FI MC 1 provides that it is potentially mitigating where the \u201cassociate(s)\nin question are not . . . in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the\nindividual to choose between loyalty to the person involved and the United States.\u201d The Appeal\nBoard interprets this language as establishing an absolute standard; i.e., an applicant must\naffirmatively prove that there is no possibility that anyone might attempt to exploit or influence a\nforeign relative or acquaintance in the future.  See ISCR Case No. 03-17620 at 4 (App. Bd. Apr. 17,\n2006) (\u201c[FI MC] 1 does not apply because, as is well settled, it requires that Applicant demonstrate\nthat his relatives are not in a position which could force Applicant to choose between his loyalty to\nthem and his loyalty to the United States.\u201d); ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2005).\nEgypt and the UAE enjoy a cordial relationship with the U.S.  The Appeal \u201cBoard has warned\n\u2018against reliance on overly simplistic distinctions between \u2018friendly\u2019 nations and \u2018hostile\u2019 nations\nwhen adjudicating cases under Guideline B.\u2019\u201d   In any event, Applicant should not be placed into\n13\na position where he may be forced to choose between loyalty to the U.S. and his in-laws living in\nEgypt and his sister and brother-in-law living in the UAE.   See ISCR Case No. 03-06267 at 4 (App.\n14\nBd. Jan. 24, 2006); ISCR Case No. 02-30535 at 4 (App. Bd. May 4, 2005).  Thus, FI MC 1  cannot\n15\nbe applied.  \nFI MC 3 can mitigate security concerns where \u201ccontact and correspondence with foreign\ncitizens are casual and infrequent.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E2.A2.1.3.3.  Applicant\u2019s contacts are limited to\noccasional telephone contact, but more accurately his contact at least in the case of his in-laws in\nEgypt is vicariously maintained through his wife\u2019s telephone calls to family members in Egypt.  He\npersonally makes limited telephone calls to his sister in the UAE.\n\nDirective, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.14.\n16\nDirective, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.15.\n17\nISCR Case No. 99-0597 (December 13, 2000).\n18\n12\nTwo of the four visits Applicant made to Egypt were of short duration.  The first visit in 1994\nwas to get married, and the second visit was to visit his dying grandmother.  The last two visits in\n2004 and 2005 were company sponsored trips in which he did not visit his in-laws.\nApplicant has failed to establish that his contacts with her siblings-in-law are casual under\nthe definition established by the Appeal Board.  See ISCR Case No. 04-00540 at 6 (App. Bd. Jan.\n7, 2007).   The term \u201ccasual\u201d means a contact that is \u201cmore fortuitous in nature than planned or\ndesigned\u201d or \u201cresulting from, or occurring by chance.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-08870 at 3 n.1 (App. Bd.\nNov. 29, 2006).  Arguably this definition of \u201ccasual\u201d is inconsistent with the Directive, as it so\nnarrows the applicability of FI MC 3 that it would only be applicable in very rare circumstances.  In\nany event, I must follow the directions of the Appeal Board and accordingly, I conclude that FI MC\n3 cannot be applied.  \nApplicant does not have any financial interests in Egypt.  This fact does not mitigate the\nforeign influence concerns based on FI DC 1 or 2.  See ISCR Case No. 04-02233 at 3 (App. Bd. May\n9, 2006).\nI conclude that no Guideline B Mitigating Conditions apply, and I expressly and specifically\nindicate that I have not relied \u201cexplicitly or implicitly\u201d on any of the Mitigating Conditions listed\nunder Guideline B of the Directive.  See ISCR Case No. 04-00540 at 6 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2007).  \nOnce the government meets its burden of proving controverted facts  the burden shifts to\n16\nan applicant to present evidence demonstrating extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances.17\nFurther, the government is under no duty to present evidence to disprove any Adjudicative Guideline\nmitigating conditions, and an administrative judge cannot assume or infer that any particular\nmitigating condition is applicable merely because the government does not present evidence to\ndisprove that particular mitigating condition.18\nI find Applicant\u2019s clarification and explanation of his one-time money transfer to his former\nbusiness partner and one-time money transfer to help his friend\u2019s father credible and accordingly find\nfor him on this SOR allegation.  His paying his former business partner, who happened to be in\nEgypt, his portion of liquidated proceeds is reasonable under the circumstances.  Also, his one-time\ntransfer of money to help his friend\u2019s father to be admitted in Egypt to a hospital for a life\nthreatening illness is also reasonable under the circumstances.  These two self-reported transfers of\nmoney to Egypt were one-time occurrences and are not ongoing.  \n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis \nIn addition to the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions as discussed\npreviously, I have considered the general adjudicative guidelines related to the whole person concept\nunder Directive \u00b6 E2.2.1.  The Appeal Board has repeatedly held that a Judge may find in favor of\n\n ISCR Case No. 02-30864 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2005); ISCR Case No. 03-11448 at 3-4 (App. Bd.

Moreover, \u201c[u]nder the whole person\n19\nconcept, the administrative judge must not consider and weigh incidents in an applicant\u2019s life\nseparately, in a piecemeal manner.  Rather, the Judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s security eligibility\nby considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s conduct and circumstances.\u201d   The directive lists nine\n20\nadjudicative process factors (APF) which are used for \u201cwhole person\u201d analysis.  Because foreign\ninfluence does not involve misconduct, voluntariness of participation, rehabilitation and behavior\nchanges, etc., the eighth APF, \u201cthe potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress,\u201d\nDirective \u00b6 E2.2.1.8, is the most relevant of the nine APFs to this adjudication.  In addition to the\n21\neighth APF, other \u201c[a]vailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and\nunfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E2.2.1.  Ultimately, the\nclearance decision is \u201can overall common sense determination.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E2.2.3.    \nThe Appeal Board requires the whole person analysis address \u201cevidence of an\napplicant\u2019s personal loyalties; the nature and extent of an applicant\u2019s family\u2019s ties to the U.S. relative\nto his [or her] ties to a foreign country; his or her ties social ties within the U.S.; and many others\nraised by the facts of a given case.\u201d ISCR Case No. 04-00540 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 5, 2007).  In that\nsame decision, the Appeal Board commended the whole person analysis in ISCR Case No. 03-02878\nat 3 (App. Bd. June 7, 2006), which provides:\nApplicant has been in the U.S for twenty years and a naturalized citizen for\nseven.  Her husband is also a naturalized citizen, and her children are U.S. citizens\nby birth.  Her ties to these family members are stronger than her ties to family\nmembers in Taiwan.  She has significant financial interests in the U.S. , and none in\nTaiwan.  She testified credibly that she takes her loyalty to the U.S. very seriously\nand would defend the interests of the U.S.  Her supervisors and co-worker assess her\nas very loyal and trustworthy.  \nThere are many countervailing, positive attributes to Applicant\u2019s life as a U.S. citizen that\nweigh towards granting his clearance.  His Egyptian passport has expired and has been returned to\nthe issuing authority.  Applicant has formally renounced his Egyptian citizenship.  He has strong\nlinks or connections to the United States: (1) Applicant and his wife became U.S. citizens, (2) Since\n1986, for the past 21 years and Applicant\u2019s adult life, has lived in the U.S., (3) Applicant and his\nwife have four U.S. born minor children, (4) Applicant\u2019s wife is very involved with their children\u2019s\nschool activities, (4) Applicant\u2019s mother has lived in the U.S. since 1994 as a permanent resident,\nshe has done everything possible to become a U.S. citizen.  Like many senior citizens, she is having\n\nDepartment Counsel did not allege financial interests as a FI DC and as stated earlier, no FI MCs apply.\n22\nHowever, I observe Applicant has no financial interests in Israel.

May 9,\n2006) (stating lack of foreign financial interests do not mitigate Guideline B security concerns based on an applicant\u2019s\nrelationship with relatives); ISCR Case No. 03-04300 (App. Bd.

June 28, 2006).\n23\n14\ndifficulty meeting the English literacy requirement, but has shown good faith in correcting this\nshortcoming, (5) Applicant holds a responsible position for a defense contractor, (6) Applicant\u2019s\nemployer holds him in the highest regard and views him as a trustworthy and critical employee, (7)\nApplicant\u2019s whole life is in the U.S.  He lives here, his immediate family is here, his four children\nwere born in the U.S. and are being educated in the U.S., (8) All his personal property is in the U.S.\nAll her financial connections are in the United States;  and (9) Applicant credibly stated that he\n22\nwould never do anything to harm the U.S., and (10) Very importantly, when Applicant had the\nslightest suspicion of an improper contact by a foreign national, he immediately reported such\ncontact to his CEO thus establishing he knew the correct security procedures and acted accordingly.\nThere is no reason to believe that he would take any action which could cause potential harm\nto his U.S. family or to this country.  He is patriotic, loves the United States, and would not permit\nany country to exploit him.  He has close ties to the United States.  His closest family members are\nhis wife and four children.  They are U.S citizens and live with him.  Because his children live in the\nUnited States, they are not vulnerable to coercion or exploitation by a foreign power.  The realistic\npossibility of pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress is low.  I base this conclusion on his credible\nand sincere testimony, and I do not believe he would compromise national security, or otherwise\ncomply with any foreign threats or coercion.  His CEO and coworker describe him as very honest,\nloyal, and trustworthy.  He is an asset to his community and company.  \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, all the facts and\ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated or overcome\nthe security concerns pertaining to foreign influence and foreign preference.  I have no doubts\nconcerning Applicant\u2019s security eligibility and suitability.  I take this position based on the law, as\nset forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the\nwhole person factors\u201d  and supporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the\n23\nAdjudicative Process, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities under Enclosure 2 of the\nDirective.  I conclude Applicant is eligible for access to classified information.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\n\n15\nParagraph 1.

Based on information from the mother and other information, Applicant\u2019s husband agreed to meet with law enforcement on April 8, 2008 at the sheriff\u2019s station to provide information of his whereabouts on April 7, 2003.

The action was taken pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February\n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended\n(Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President\non December 29, 2005, and made effective within the Department of Defense for SORs\nissued on or after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant submitted her answer to the SOR on December 11, 2007. DOHA\nissued a notice of hearing on April 7, 2008, and the hearing was held on May 9, 2008.\nAt the hearing, eight exhibits (GE 1 through 7, GE 9) were admitted in evidence over\nobjection, to support the government\u2019s case. Applicant testified. In the time allowed for\nher to furnish additional documentation, she submitted AE A through AE C, character\nreferences from her friend and her mother. DOHA received a copy of the transcript of\nSeptember 16, 2008\n\n2\nthe proceedings on May 15, 2008. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings,\nexhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nRulings on Procedure\nI decided not to admit GE 8. In response to the government\u2019s argument that the\nfinancial issue was being alleged under personal conduct (PC) disqualifying condition\n(DC) 16.c. and 16.d. of the AG, the government had more than a reasonable period of\ntime to amend the SOR to embrace the financial issue as representing additional,\ncredible, adverse information that could support a whole person assessment of poor\njudgment and unreliability and poor judgment. Furthermore, the exhibit displays only\nthree delinquent debts totaling less than $2,000.00. The modest, delinquent amount has\nnegligible probative value in a whole person assessment of unreliability or other\ncharacteristics indicating Applicant may not properly safeguard classified information.\nFinally, Applicant has held a security clearance since February 2003 with no record of\nsecurity violations. \nFindings of Fact\nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, she denied the criminal conduct and personal\nconduct allegations without explanation. \nApplicant is 32 years old and married. She has worked as an administrative\nassistant for her current employer (defense contractor) since May 2001, and has held a\nsecurity clearance since February 2003. She has a Bachelor\u2019s degree in Business.\nCriminal Conduct\nGE 3 contains a series of criminal investigative reports dated April 7 through April\n23, 2003 regarding a homicide that occurred on April 7, 2003. These reports cover\ninterviews the investigating detective had with Applicant, her current husband (who was\nher boyfriend in April 2003), and her boyfriend\u2019s mother. (The investigating detective\ntestified at the hearing.) There are two interviews of Applicant\u2019s husband and one\ninterview of Applicant.\nOn April 7, 2003, the mother of Applicant\u2019s husband (her boyfriend in April 2003)\ncalled the sheriff\u2019s department about a homicide of a woman that had been in a\nrelationship with Applicant\u2019s husband. Based on information from the mother and other\ninformation, Applicant\u2019s husband agreed to meet with law enforcement on April 8, 2008\nat the sheriff\u2019s station to provide information of his whereabouts on April 7, 2003. The\nboyfriend stated he was home all day on April 7, 2003. At about 3:30 P.M., according to\nhim, Applicant returned home, and they watched movies. The detective then asked the\nboyfriend about child support of $1,200.00 and $200.00 a month he owed to \u201cShelly,\u201d\nthe murder victim. The boyfriend replied that she (victim) did not need the child support,\nas she would use the money to get her hair prepared. \n\n3\nAfter receiving the cellular telephone (cell-phone) records for Appellant\u2019s\nhusband for the date of April 7, 2003, law enforcement individuals, including the\ninvestigating detective, discovered that three calls were placed from the cell phone at\n7:20 A.M., 7:25 A.M., and 7:53 A.M. to Applicant\u2019s home phone. In short, the calls had\nbeen placed at locations other than where the home was located. \nOn April 19, 2003, the detective traveled to the home where Applicant and her\nboyfriend lived to interview Applicant about the events of April 7, 2003. She claimed (GE\n3) she left home for work that day about 7:45 A.M. to 8 A.M. because she was running\nlate. She returned home between 5 P.M. and 6 P.M. that afternoon. Her husband was\nnot at home when she returned. The investigator noted that her account of when she\nleft for work differed from her boyfriend\u2019s account. The report does not, however,\nreference what her boyfriend initially stated when she left their home in the morning of\nApril 7, 2003. Regarding her return home, the report reveals an initial inconsistency in\ntheir accounts on when she returned home. In a subsequent interview, Applicant\u2019s\nhusband changed his account by stating that Applicant returned home about 6:30 P.M.\nIn his last interview on April 23, 2003 (the last two pages of GE 3), the\ninvestigator confronted Applicant\u2019s husband with the inconsistencies about when his\nwife came home. The investigator asked about the three cell-phone calls made to his\nnumber from locations other than his home. He stated he was unconcerned about the\ninformation in the cell records. He maintained he was at home the entire day of April 7,\n2003. In addition, he was the only person who used his cell phone, and his cell phone\nwas always with him. Except for the time Applicant returned home from work, he\nmaintained his original account provided on April 8, 2003 was truthful. Regarding the\ntime Applicant came home, her husband changed his earlier account by indicating that\nshe returned home about 6:30 P.M., rather than 3:30 P.M., as he had stated on April 8,\n2003. \nSOR 1.a. On April 19, 2003, Applicant was interviewed by at least one detective\nand the testifying detective from the sheriff\u2019s department regarding her schedule and\ncontact with her then co-habitant (now spouse) on April 7, 2003 (Tr. 70, 98), the date of\na homicide of a woman known by her co-habitant.\nSOR 1.b. The allegation reflects the investigation is \u201cactive.\u201d On page 51 of the\ntranscript, the investigative detective testified that no evidence has been uncovered\nsince the homicide to exonerate Applicant\u2019s husband, and that her husband remains a\n\u201cprime suspect.\u201d Then, the detective indicated he is no longer assigned to the case due\nto a promotion. Occasionally, as the detective noted, he looks into the case and became\naware Applicant and her husband moved to another location. (Id.) When asked at the\nhearing by Applicant to disclose evidence that connects her husband to the homicide,\nthe detective responded that he could not answer the question because the case is an\n\u201cactive homicide investigation,\u201d and, \u201cWell, - - we can\u2019t talk about the evidence. It\u2019s an\nongoing investigation and - - and I could get - - could very well jeopardize the case.\u201d (Tr.\n63-65) I find the homicide investigation of Applicant\u2019s husband to still be \u201cactive,\u201d even\nthough more than five years have passed since GE 3 was prepared. \n\n4\nRegarding the second half of SOR 1.b., \u201cwhether you were involved in the crime\nor in an attempt to cover up your spouse\u2019s involvement,\u201d I find that Applicant made a\nfalse statement when she indicated she was with her husband in her apartment on April\n7, 2003, until she left for work, and denying the cell phone calls. The false statement was\nand still is material to the \u201cactive\u201d murder investigation of her husband. \nPersonal Conduct (PC)\nSOR 2.a. On April 15, 2003, the investigating detective received cellular\ntelephone (cell phone) records of Applicant\u2019s husband disclosing that three cell phone\ncalls were made to her husband\u2019s home telephone number on April 7, 2003. (GE 3) The\ncalls were made at 7:20 A.M., 7:25 A.M., and 7:53 A.M. (Id.)\nOn April 18, 2003, the investigating detective also received additional cell phone\nrecords from a telecommunications company revealing that the cell phone records of\nApplicant\u2019s husband disclose that his cell phone was used to make two phone calls to his\nhome phone on April 7, 2003, at 7:20 A.M. and 7:25 A.M. (Id.) Applicant claimed she\nwas with her husband at home until she left for work, and they received no calls. (Tr. 79-\n83) In support of her claim the telephone companies and/or sheriff\u2019s department were\nfabricating the cell phone calls on April 7, 2003, Applicant stated:\nI believe the cell phone companies are not a trustworthy source. There\u2019s\nbeen plenty of times when I\u2019ve been places and people\u2019s cell have called\nme and they didn\u2019t even know. It was just the last number dialed. \nAnd if you accidentally hit a button, it will ring. That\u2019s happened several\ntimes to me and nobody has even been on the phone. I just heard their\nentire conversation while they were talking and they had talked to me last\nbut it (cell phone) just redialed the number. They were unaware of it as\nwell. (Tr. 81)\nIt is common knowledge that cellular phone towers relay cell calls from tower to\ntower until the call reaches its destination. Just as telephone companies keep records on\nland-based telephone calls, they also keep records of cell calls for public safety and\nbilling reasons. Applicant\u2019s explanation for denying calls were made to her home on April\n7, 2003, seem to relate to operation of the cell phone rather than record keeping for cell\nphone transmissions. Hence, I find her explanation not credible.\nThere are other areas of Applicant\u2019s testimony that negatively impact her\ncredibility. When asked certain questions at the hearing about her April 19, 2003\ninterview concerning when she left her apartment for work on April 7, 2003 (GE 3), she\ndisputed the statement in the exhibit indicating she was behind schedule. (Tr. 72) She,\nthen stated she did not recall when she left. (Tr. 75) Later in her testimony, she testified\nthat she did not believe she left home between 7:45 A.M. and 8 P.M., \u201cbecause a lot of\nthings in the statement are not true.\u201d (Tr. 76) Still later in her testimony (Tr. 88), she\nclaimed her husband transported her to work that day. She did agree that her memory of\n\n5\nthe time she left the house for work on April 7, 2003 would have been better when she\nwas interviewed on April 19, 2003 than it was at the hearing. (Tr. 75) \nDuring her direct testimony, Applicant repeated her claim that she was\ncooperative during the investigation. She testified:\nI would like to say that I have been very cooperative throughout this entire\ninvestigation every time I\u2019ve been asked any questions and haven\u2019t\nhesitated to give any answers that they wanted. I even let them search my\nhome without a search warrant. And just on [in the] nick of time. I would\nalso like to say that based on [detective\u2019s] interview - -Yes. Based on\nDetective\u2019s interview, these are all allegations and all hearsay I have never\nseen him. That\u2019s why I couldn\u2019t really direct a conversation towards him.\nBecause I don\u2019t even remember him coming to my house. I remember\nsomeone short and kind of bald that searched my home that day. So - - - -\nso just based on his testimony, they were all allegations and hearsay. And\nit was I think maybe someone conducted the interview and then he\n[testifying detective] wrote the report up and that\u2019s how it went. I don\u2019t\nbelieve that anything they have is a fact. And that\u2019s all I have to say. (Tr.\n90-92)\nThe search of Applicant\u2019s dwelling took place on April 19, 2003. The detective\ntestified he asked Applicant for consent to search. After allowing her to remove illegal\ndrugs from the apartment (Tr. 61), the detective conducted a search. In explaining that\nApplicant was not uncooperative during the search of Applicant\u2019s apartment, the\ndetective testified:\nShe [Applicant] referenced there may be some items in there that were not\nlegal. I told her unless they were related to my investigation, I likely was not\nworried about them.\nAnd if she needed - - you know, I - - I - - I stressed to her it was not a\nmatter, that I was dealing with a homicide investigation. I wasn\u2019t\nnecessarily concerned with things that were not related to that. (Tr. 62) \nWhen the government asked Applicant to explain (before the search) what the\ntestifying detective thought Applicant was talking about when she referred to items that\nwere not legal, the detective believed Applicant was referring to illegal drugs. (Tr. 65)\nApplicant denied she had any exchange with the testifying detective about drugs or\nanything else, because she had never seen the detective before the hearing. (Tr. 92)\nEven though drug possession is unalleged in the SOR, the evidence regarding\nApplicant\u2019s concern over illegal drugs being present in her apartment undercuts her\ncredibility even further.\n\n6\nCharacter Evidence\nA personal friend of Applicant who graduated from high school with her in April\n1994 considers her an ethical person who is also a good communicator and leader.\nApplicant\u2019s mother describes Applicant, her youngest daughter, to be considerate,\nsupportive, and a self-starter. Applicant\u2019s initiative has helped her gain a Bachelor\u2019s\ndegree in business. \nAn unsigned letter from Applicant\u2019s deputy director dated May 14, 2008, reflects\nthat Applicant has been working for \u201cINL\u201d for a year. The director confirms she is a\nhardworking, dependable employee who is dedicated to her work tasks, even when her\nson is ill. Applicant\u2019s oldest sister submitted an unsigned character statement extolling\nApplicant\u2019s character for dedication and intelligence. Her sister recommends Applicant\nfor a position of trust based on Applicant\u2019s honesty, professionalism, and communication\nskills. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are flexible rules of law. Recognizing the complexities of human\nbehavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the\nadjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s ultimate adjudicative goal is a fair,\nimpartial and common sense decision. According to the AG, the entire process is a\ncareful, thorough evaluation of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person\nconcept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable information\nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2b.\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have\ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence\ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere\nspeculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \n\n7\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\nis not restricted to normal duty hours. Rather, the relationship is an-around-the-clock\nresponsibility between an applicant and the federal government. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as\nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\nCriminal Conduct (CC)\nViolating the law immediately raises questions about a person\u2019s judgment which\nare not easily mitigated by simply the passage of time. \nPersonal Conduct (PC)\nDeliberately concealing information during the course of a security clearance\nprocess demonstrates dishonesty and poor judgment while representing a serious\nsecurity concern.\nAnalysis\nCriminal Conduct (CC)\n30. The Concern. \u201cCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\u201d AG \u00b6 30\nCell telephone records (GE 3) reflect that three cellular telephone calls were made\nto the Applicant\u2019s apartment phone on April 7, 2003, between 7 and 8 A.M. Applicant\nclaims she was at home with her husband during the pertinent time period and denies\nshe received any calls. Applicant\u2019s conduct falls within CC disqualifying condition (DC)\n31.a. (a single serious crime or multiple lesser included offenses) and CC DC 31.c.\n(allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was\nformally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted) Applicant was interviewed (as\nalleged in SOR 1.a.) by the sheriff\u2019s office on April 19, 2003 regarding her schedule on\nApril 7, 2003. I determine she made a false statement regarding her husband\u2019s\nwhereabouts and regarding the three phone calls, as alleged in SOR 1.b. \nThe three elements of the state criminal defining false statements made to a law\nenforcement officer (GE 5) are also satisfied by Applicant\u2019s false statement in April 2003.\nEven though Applicant continues to claim the cell records are inaccurate or fabricated,\nher uncorroborated explanations in support of her claim are not credible. The third\nelement of the statute is that Applicant provided her false statement to a law\n\n There is insufficient evidence to meet the four elements of the state criminal statute of \u201caccessory after the\n1\nfact.\u201d See, GE 6, GE 7.\n8\nenforcement officer, the detective who testified at the hearing.  Even though the state\n1\nstatute does not include \u201cmateriality\u201d as an element of the offense,\u201d Applicant\u2019s false\nstatement is material to the active criminal investigation. \nI have considered the mitigating conditions and have concluded that none apply\nbased on Applicant\u2019s persistent contention she received no cellular phone calls on April\n7, 2003. CC MC 32.a. (so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened\nor it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not\ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) cannot be\nconsidered as long as Applicant denies she received the cell calls. CC 32.b. (the person\nwas pressured or coerced into committing the act and those pressures are no longer\npresent in the person\u2019s life) is unavailable for mitigation as there is no evidence to infer\nor suggest that any pressure was applied on Applicant to provide the false statement.\nCC MC 32.c. (evidence that the person did not commit the act) must also be removed\nfrom consideration because there is no evidence that Applicant did not make the false\nstatement. CC MC 32.d. (there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not\nlimited to the passage of time without recurrence or criminal activity, remorse or\nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or constructive\ncommunity involvement) The key to successful rehabilitation is accepting dishonest\nconduct. Applicant refuses to acknowledge the cellular phone records belie her claim of\nbeing with her husband at her apartment on April 7, 2003. Her husband stated his cell\nphone was always in his possession. Applicant\u2019s favorable character traits as a friend\nand daughter do not overcome her intentional false statement to law enforcement in April\n2003 that she continues to deny.\nPersonal Conduct (PC)\n15. The Concern. \u201cConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers\nduring the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security\nclearance process.\u201d AG \u00b6 15\nPC DC 16.a. (deliberate omission, falsification of relevant facts from any\npersonnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to\nconduct investigations, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness)\napplies. Cellular phone records referenced in GE 3 reflect that three cell calls were made\nfrom the cell phone of Applicant\u2019s husband to Applicant\u2019s apartment on April 7, 2003, at\n7:20 A.M., 7:25 A.M., and 7:53 A.M. Applicant\u2019s strenuous claim that she was with her\nhusband throughout the time period in issue represents a false statement concerning the\nlocation of her husband when the calls were placed. Applicant\u2019s false statement\n\n9\ndemonstrates poor judgment under the PC guideline. SOR 2.a. and 2.b. are resolved\nagainst Applicant. \nI have carefully considered the following mitigating conditions to determine\nwhether Applicant\u2019s intentional omissions are mitigated: PC MC 17.a. (the individual\nmade prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission or falsification before being\nconfronted with the facts); PC MC 17.c. (the offense is so minor, or so much time has\npassed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness or good judgment); and, PC MC 17.d. (the individual has\nacknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to change the behavior or taken\nother steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused\nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely\nto recur) \nPC MC 17. a. does not apply because Applicant made no prompt, good-faith\nattempt to correct the falsification, as she still does not consider she furnished a false\nstatement about the phone records. PC MC 17.b. (the offense was so minor, or such\ntime passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) does not apply. While Applicant articulated\nher false statement in April 2003, she continues to deny the veracity of the cell records.\nFinally, PC MC 17.d. (the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained\ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors,\ncircumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate\nbehavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur) does not apply because Applicant does\nnot admit to the illegality of her conduct. The only other mitigating condition that could\napply is PC MC 17.e. (the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate\nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress) PC MC 17.e. does not become\npertinent for mitigation purposes until Applicant takes a positive step (to acknowledge)\nthe accuracy of the cell records. This she has not done. In sum, Applicant\u2019s evidence in\nmitigation does not satisfy her ultimate burden of persuasion under the PC guideline. \nWhole Person Concept (WPC) \nI have weighed the circumstances of this case under the general factors of the\nwhole person concept. Applicant was twenty seven years of age when she provided a\nfalse statement to law enforcement about her husband\u2019s cell records on April 7, 2003.\nShe provided no corroborative evidence substantiating her complaints about evidence\ngathered during the investigation, and a motive the testifying detective would have to\nfabricate the investigation. Though Applicant claims she was cooperative during the\ncourse of the search of her apartment on April 19, 2003, the testifying officer took a\ndifferent view of her cooperation, because the search did not begin until after she\nremoved some items from her apartment. Having weighed the disqualifying evidence\nagainst Applicant\u2019s favorable record showing no security violations, and the positive\n\n10\ncharacter evidence from her director, friend, mother, and oldest sister, Applicant still has\nnot satisfied her ultimate burden of persuasion under the CC and PC guidelines. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1 (Criminal Conduct, Guideline J):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.\nAgainst  Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2 (Personal Conduct, Guideline E): AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a. \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b.\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n                       \nPaul J. Mason\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On October 27, 2005, DOHA issued a statement of reasons advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) and Guideline\nJ (Criminal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended)\n(Directive).  Applicant requested a decision on the written record.  On October 6, 2006, after\nconsidering the record, Administrative Judge Kathryn Moen Braeman granted Applicant\u2019s request\nfor a security clearance.  Department Counsel filed a timely appeal pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28\nand E3.1.30.\nDepartment Counsel raises the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in\nconcluding that the provisions of 10 U.S.C. 968 do not apply to Applicant\u2019s case; and whether the\nJudge\u2019s decision that Applicant had mitigated security concerns raised under Guideline E was\narbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law.  We reverse the decision of the Judge.\nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Factual Findings\nThe Judge found that Applicant was sentenced to four years incarceration as a result of a\n1974 charge of Armed Robbery.  She then found that there is no documentation as to the time served\nby Applicant under this sentence.  The Judge also found that Applicant had other criminal arrests (to\ninclude felonies) in 1970, 1980 and 1990.  \nThe SOR alleges in subparagraph 1(b) that Applicant was convicted of armed robbery, a\nfelony, and sentenced to four years confinement.  The SOR states that Applicant was \u201creceived on\nFebruary 7, 1974, at the Mississippi Department of Corrections, Parchman, Mississippi, and\ndischarged on July 11, 1975.\u201d  The SOR further alleges in subparagraph 1(h) that \u201c[d]ue to the facts\nalleged in subparagraph 1(b) above, 10 U.S.C. 986  disqualifies you from having a security clearance\n1\ngranted or renewed by the Department of Defense.\u201d  \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant states the following regarding paragraph 1, the\nGuideline J criminal conduct security concerns: \u201cA - I involving criminal history \u2013 I ADMIT.\u201d   The\nJudge found that Applicant\u2019s response meant that he was admitting only the subparagraph 1.a of the\nSOR.  Because there is no further mention of time served by Applicant, the Judge concluded that the\ngovernment had failed to meet its burden of production regarding the application of 10 U.S.C. 986.\nSee Directive \u00b6  E3.1.14.  \nThe Appeal Board\u2019s review of the Judge\u2019s findings of fact is limited to determining if they\nare supported by substantial evidence\u2013such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as\nadequate to support such a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  Directive\n\u00b6  E3.1.32.1.  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing\ntwo inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency\u2019s findings\nfrom being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d  Consolo v.

Directive  \u00b6  E3.1.32.1. \n\n3\nOn appeal, Department Counsel asserts that Applicant admitted 17 months of actual\nincarceration in his answer to the SOR and that this admission was sufficient to trigger the\napplication of 10 U.S.C. 986.  The Board Agrees, reading Applicant\u2019s response as admitting all\nallegations in paragraph 1 of the SOR regarding his criminal conduct, to include the facts necessary\nto establish the Smith Act prohibition.  The Judge\u2019s interpretation of Applicant\u2019s answer as including\nonly a response to subparagraph 1.a under Guideline J, to the exclusion of subparagraphs 1.b through\n1.i, is untenable given the Applicant\u2019s reference to \u201cA - I\u201d and his use of the words \u201cinvolving\ncriminal history\u201d before stating \u201cI admit.\u201d  Applicant was clearly referring to more than subparagraph\n1.a when making his admission, which relieved Department Counsel of her evidentiary burden on\nthe issue of the length of Applicant\u2019s incarceration after his 1973 arrest and conviction for armed\nrobbery.  Therefore, we conclude that the Judge erred in her Guideline J analysis.  \nWhether the Record Supports the Administrative Judge\u2019s Conclusions\nThe Judge\u2019s erroneous finding regarding Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR and the applicability\nof 10 U.S.C. 986 is dispositive of this case.\nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s favorable clearance decision is REVERSED.  \nSigned: Michael Y.

On December 12, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant detailing security concerns under \nGuidelines G and B.  The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by President Bush on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \nApplicant submitted an Answer to the SOR on February 4, 2009, and requested a \ndecision without a hearing. Department Counsel submitted a File of Relevant Material \n(FORM) to the Applicant on March 17, 2009. The Applicant received the FORM on March \n27, 2009, and was given 30 days to submit any additional information. He elected not to \nsubmit any additional information. The case was assigned to me on June 17, 2009.  Based \n \n \n1 \n \n\n \n \n2 \n \nupon a review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \n \n \nRulings on Procedure \n \nMotion to Amend the SOR \n \n \nThe Government moved to amend the SOR by adding two allegations under \nGuideline E. (Item 2.) This amendment is dated March 12, 2009. The Applicant was \nprovided a copy of this Motion to Amend the Statement of Reasons, along with the FORM, \non March 17, 2009.  \n \n \nThe Applicant was specifically informed that he had the ability to object to the \nproposed amendment and, if he did not object, to submit a response to the amended SOR. \nThe Applicant did not submit an objection to the Motion. The Motion is granted and the \nSOR is amended to add Paragraph 3 under Guideline E and two subparagraphs, 3.a. and \n3.b., as shown in Item 2. \n \n \nThe Applicant did not submit any additional information concerning the Guideline E \nallegations. I view this as being a denial of the allegations. \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice of \ncertain facts relating to the ---------------- (Country One) and the ---------------------------------- \n(Country Two). (FORM at 3-11.) The request and the attached documents were not \nadmitted into evidence but were included in the record. The facts administratively noticed \nare set out in the Findings of Fact, below.  \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nThe Applicant is 52 and married.  He is employed by a defense contractor and seeks \nto obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment in the defense industry. \n \nParagraph 1 (Guideline G - Alcohol Consumption) \n \nThe Government alleges under Guideline G that the Applicant is ineligible for \nclearance because he uses intoxicants to excess. The Applicant admitted subparagraphs \n1.a., 1.b., and 1.c. Those admissions are hereby deemed findings of fact. He denied 1.d. \n \n1.a. The Applicant was charged with Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol in 2007, \nwhile working for his employer in the ---------------------- (Country Three).  He paid a fine to \nthe government of Country Three, and his employer transferred him back to the United \nStates. (Item 8 at 3, and Item 10.) \n\n \n \n3 \n \n \n1.b.  The Applicant was arrested in October 2003 on an American military installation \nin Country Three for Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol. The Applicant admits being \nrequired to take alcohol education classes and his driver\u2019s license being restricted. \n \n1.c.  The Applicant was arrested for Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol (DUI) in \nAugust 1998 on an American military installation in ---------- (Country Four). According to \nthe Military Police report, the Applicant refused to complete the field sobriety test and also \nrefused to take any breath tests. As a result of this incident his driving privileges on the \nbase were suspended for one year. (Item 9.) \n \n1.d.  The Applicant denied that, as of November 2007, he drank to the point of \nintoxication two to three times per month. In his Answer the Applicant states, \u201cI only stated \nthat I only drink a few beers two to three times a month.\u201d In a report of an interview with the \nApplicant, which the Applicant authenticated as being accurate on the day he was \ninterviewed, it is stated: \n \nThe subject [Applicant] becomes intoxicated after drinking three beers. \nWhen intoxicated, the subject becomes friendly and sociable. The subject will \ndrink to intoxication two to three times a month. The subject does not believe \nhe has a problem with alcohol. The subject\u2019s future intentions are to quit \ndrinking alcohol all together. It has caused to (sic) many problems for him in \nthe past. (Item 8 at 4.) \n \n \nIn an Interrogatory dated May 5, 2008, the Applicant stated that he continued to \ndrink alcohol two to three times monthly.  In addition, he stated that the last time he was \nintoxicated was December 24, 2005. (Item 7.) \n \nParagraph 2 (Guideline B - Foreign Influence)   \n \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for \nclearance because he has foreign contacts and interests that could lead to the exercise of \npoor judgment, unreliability or untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant. The Applicant \nadmitted all of the allegations under this paragraph. Those allegations are hereby deemed \nfindings of fact. \n \n \nThe Applicant\u2019s wife is a citizen and resident Country One. She lives there with the \nApplicant\u2019s two children as well as his two step-children. The step-children are also citizens \nof Country One. The Applicant states in his Answer, \u201cMy wife has no interest in becoming \nan American citizen. . . . Because of the assignments I have chosen, my wife and I decided \nfor the family to reside in [Country One] to receive family and moral support during my \ndeployment. My intentions [are] to retire in [Country One] in the future.\u201d \n \n \nThe Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law and her second husband are citizens of Country One \nand reside in Country Two. The Applicant admits that the husband is employed on a \npersonal basis by an important person in Country Two. The Applicant states in his Answer, \n\n \n \n4 \n \n                                                \n\u201cI do not receive any benefits through my mother-in-law (sic) husband employment with [the \nimportant person].\u201d Other than this statement, the record is silent regarding the extent and \ndepth of the Applicant\u2019s relationship with his relatives who live in Country Two. \n \n \nThe Applicant has many contacts with Country One.  Accordingly, it is appropriate to \ndiscuss the situation in Country One at this time.1  Country One is a multiparty republic  \nwith an elected president and bicameral legislature. It is a representative democracy \nmodeled on the U.S. system and has been a close ally of the United States with ties \nstretching back more then a century. Country One has severe economic problems, \nexacerbated by threats from terrorist groups in certain parts of the country. A travel warning \nhas been issued to U.S. citizens, warning them of the potential terrorist threat in Country \nOne. In addition to the terrorist threat, the United States is also concerned about internal \nhuman rights issues which present a serious destabilizing concern. These include arbitrary, \nunlawful and extrajudicial killings by elements of the security services, as well as arbitrary \nand warrantless arrests and detentions. \n \n \nThe Applicant also has contacts, through his wife\u2019s family, with Country Two. It is \nalso appropriate to discuss the situation in that country as well. Country Two is a monarchy \nwith an all-powerful ruling family. The central institution of the Country Two government is \nthe monarchy, and there are no political parties or national elections. The United States \nGovernment finds that there are significant human rights problems in Country Two, such as \njudicially sanctioned corporal punishment, denial of public trials, and restrictions on civil \nliberties. There is corruption and a lack of government transparency, as well as \ndiscrimination and violence against women. Other religious, ethnic and minority groups \nhave faced discrimination. Terrorist acts have been committed against Americans in \nCountry Two and the U.S. Government has issued a travel warning due to the ongoing \nsecurity threat. \n  \nParagraph 3 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct) \n \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for \nclearance because he has made false statements to the Government during the clearance \nscreening process.  The Applicant is deemed to have denied the two allegations under this \nparagraph. \n \n3.a. The Applicant filled out a Security Clearance Application on January 27, 2003.  \nIn that Application the Applicant was required to answer Question 24., which asked, \u201cHave \nyou ever been charged with or convicted of any offense(s) related to alcohol or drugs?\u201d He \nstated \u201cNo.\u201d This was a false answer to a relevant question concerning his prior use of \nalcohol.  The report of the Applicant\u2019s interview held in November 2007 states, \u201cRegarding \nthe unadmitted 1998 drunk driving arrest, the subject forgot about the incident when \ncompleting the SF86.\u201d (Item 8 at 3.) The Applicant did not file an answer regarding this \nallegation in the amended SOR, which I find is a denial. Given the state of this record, I \n \n1All of the following statements regarding Country One and Country Two are supported by the documents \nsubmitted by the Department Counsel in support of her request for administrative notice and its attachments.  \n\n \n \n5 \n \ncannot find with a reasonable degree of certainty that the Applicant intentionally falsified his \nApplication. This subparagraph is found for the Applicant. \n \n3.b.  The Government alleges in this subparagraph that the Applicant withheld \ninformation during his November 2007 interview. Specifically, that he was questioned about \nother alcohol related incidents and, while revealing one in January 2007, he actively failed \nto disclose information on the 2003 DUI arrest set forth in subparagraph 1.b., above. I have \nreviewed the statement and it does not state that the Applicant actively, or passively, \ndenied any other alcohol related incidents. Given the state of this record, I cannot find with \na reasonable degree of certainty that the Applicant intentionally did not tell the interviewer \nabout his 2003 arrest. This subparagraph is found for the Applicant.  \n \n \nPolicies \n \nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  When evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the administrative judge must consider the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for each \nguideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are useful in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities \nof human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past \nand present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.  In addition, the \nadministrative judge may also rely on his own common sense, as well as his knowledge of \nthe law, human nature, and the ways of the world, in making a reasoned decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified \ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.  \n \n\n \n \n6 \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Security clearance decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n  \nFinally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Section 7 of Executive Order \n10865, \u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to \nclassified or sensitive information).   \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nParagraph 1 (Guideline G - Alcohol Consumption) \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Alcohol Consumption is set out in \nAG \u00b6 21:       \n \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of \nquestionable judgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \n \nThe Applicant was involved in three alcohol related incidents between 1998 and \n2007.  All three occurred in foreign countries. The Applicant continues to drink alcohol, \neven though he admits that his alcohol use has had an adverse impact on his life. \n \nThere are two Disqualifying Conditions concerning Alcohol Consumption that apply \nto this case.  AG \u00b6 22.(a) \u201calcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while \nunder the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents \nof concern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or \nalcohol dependent.\u201d  In addition, AG \u00b6 22.(c) applies, \u201chabitual or binge consumption of \nalcohol to the point of impaired judgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed \nas an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent.\u201d    \n \nAfter considering the evidence in the record, I find that the arguably applicable \nMitigating Conditions under Alcohol Consumption do not apply to this case.  AG \u00b6 23.(a) \nstates that it can be a mitigating condition when, \u201cso much time has passed, or the behavior \nwas so infrequent, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to \nrecur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness or good \njudgment.\u201d  AG \u00b6 23.(b) states that it can be mitigating where, \u201cthe individual acknowledges \n\n \n \n7 \n \nhis or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol abuse, provides evidence of actions taken to \novercome this problem, and has established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) \nor responsible use (if an alcohol abuser).\u201d \n \nAs stated above, the Applicant\u2019s last alcohol related arrest was two years ago. \nHowever, he continues to drink alcohol even though he acknowledges that it has had an \nadverse impact on his life and job.  His conduct by definition does not show reliability, \ntrustworthiness or good judgment. \n \nThe Applicant has not mitigated the security significance of his alcohol consumption. \n Paragraph 1 of the SOR is found against the Applicant. \n \nParagraph 2 (Guideline B \u2013 Foreign Contacts) \n \nThe concern under Guideline B is styled as follows: \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the \nindividual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be \nmanipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or \ngovernment in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and \nshould consider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact \nor financial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk \nof terrorism. \n \n \nThe Applicant has close connections to both Country One and Country Two. The \nApplicant has not submitted any information which would overcome the government\u2019s case. \nThe evidence shows that his immediate family lives in Country One, which has a serious \nproblem with domestic terrorism. His wife\u2019s mother and her second husband live in Country \nTwo. Not only that, but the husband works for an important person in Country Two, a nation \nwhere serious human rights violations take place. It is the Applicant\u2019s burden to show that \nthese connections do not have an impact on his security worthiness. His failure to respond \nin any way, other then the bald statements in his Answer, makes it impossible for me to \nmitigate these allegations. \n \nBased on the evidence the government has presented, the following Disqualifying \nConditions apply to this case: AG \u00b6 7.(a) \u201ccontact with a foreign family member . . . who is a \ncitizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion\u201d; and AG \u00b6 7.(b) \u201cconnections \nto a foreign person . . . or country that create a potential conflict of interest between the \nindividual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s \ndesire to help a foreign person . . . or country by providing that information.\u201d I have also \nconsidered the information concerning Country One and Country Two, provided by \nDepartment Counsel in her request for administrative notice and its attachments.  \n\n \n \n8 \n \n \nThe Applicant has not provided compelling evidence to show that the following \nMitigating Conditions also apply to this particular case, given his particular background:  AG \n\u00b6 8.(a) \u201cthe nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these \npersons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are such \nthat it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the \ninterests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.\u201d; and AG \u00b6 8.(b) \u201cthere is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense \nof loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is so minimal, \nor the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., \nthat the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. \ninterest.\u201d  Paragraph 2 is found against the Applicant. \n \nParagraph 3 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct) \n \nAs stated above, I cannot find that the Applicant did intentionally falsify a Security \nClearance Application and withhold information during an interview. Paragraph 3 is found \nfor the Applicant. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances.  Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether \nto grant eligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment \nbased upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. The \nadministrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 \n2(a) in making a reasoned decision:  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) \nthe potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n        \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case.  The Applicant has had three alcohol \nrelated arrests in 10 years.  The acts are frequent and recent.  He continues to drink \nalcohol.  I find these incidents show a pattern of alcohol dependence and/or alcohol abuse. \nIn addition, the Applicant has significant family connections in Country One and Country \nTwo which make it impossible to grant him a security clearance at this time. In viewing all \nthe facts of this case, I find that the Applicant has not mitigated the security significance of \nhis prior conduct and situation.  As set forth at length above, I find that the there have not \n\n \n \n9 \n \nbeen permanent behavioral changes under AG \u00b6 2(a)(6); and that the likelihood of \ncontinuation or recurrence is very high (AG \u00b6 2(a)(9)). In addition, I also find that the \npotential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress also exists (AG \u00b6 2(a)(8)). \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and/or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude the Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his alcohol \nrelated incidents, and his foreign contacts.   \n \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has not successfully overcome the \nGovernment's case opposing his request for a DoD security clearance.  Accordingly, the \nevidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary \nallegations expressed in Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Government's Statement of Reasons.  \nAs set forth above, Paragraph 3 is found for the Applicant. \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \n \nAGAINST THE APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst the Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst the Applicant  \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nAgainst the Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nAgainst the Applicant  \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline B:  \n \nAGAINST THE APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nAgainst the Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \n \nAgainst the Applicant  \nSubparagraph 2.c:  \n \n \nAgainst the Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.d:  \n \n \nAgainst the Applicant  \nSubparagraph 2.e:  \n \n \nAgainst the Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.f:  \n \n \nAgainst the Applicant \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:  \n \nFOR THE APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \n \n \nFor the Applicant \nSubparagraph 3.b.:  \n \n \nFor the Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n10 \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

On September 6, 2005, DOHA issued a statement of reasons advising Applicant of the\n\nDepartment Counsel does not appeal the Judge\u2019s findings and conclusions regarding Guideline C.\n1\nApplicant denies the existence of an uncle.

Applicant requested a hearing.  On August 31, 2007, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge Jacqueline T. Williams granted Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nDepartment Counsel timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nDepartment Counsel raises the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s decision is\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.1\nWhether the Record Supports the Administrative Judge\u2019s Factual Findings\nA.  The Judge made the following relevant findings of fact:\nApplicant was born in Iran and immigrated the United States at the age of 18 in 1978.  He\nbecame a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1982.  His wife is a dual citizen of the U.S. and Iran.\nApplicant\u2019s two children are American citizens by birth.\nApplicant applied for an Iranian passport, which was reissued in December 1998.  Applicant\nused the Iranian passport to travel to Iran in at least 1997, 1998, and 2000 for family reasons.\nApplicant still possessed an Iranian passport when he was interviewed by an investigator on February\n9, 2005.  Eight days later, the Embassy of Pakistan confirmed that Applicant submitted his passport\nin order to renounce his Iranian citizenship.  Applicant stated that he no longer considers himself an\nIranian citizen.  Applicant has no assets in Iran. \nApplicant\u2019s parents are dual citizens of the U.S. and Iran.  His father is a retired physician,\nand his mother is a retired midwife.  Applicant states that his parents never worked for the Iranian\ngovernment.  Applicant\u2019s parents travel to Iran about every other year to visit family.  Applicant has\ntwo siblings who were born in Iran, but now live in the United States.  Applicant is unsure whether\nthey are dual citizens.  Applicant does not believe they have traveled back to Iran.  \nApplicant has two aunts, cousins, and an uncle who are citizens and residents of Iran.2\nApplicant speaks to his aunts once or twice a year and each cousin about twice a year.  One aunt was\na doctor, and one was a physical therapist.  Applicant is not sure what work his cousins do, but states\nthat neither the aunts nor the cousins have ever worked for the Iranian government. \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant bought his house from an individual who is under\ninvestigation by the U.S. government for links to terrorist organizations.  The SOR also alleges that\nat least two of Applicant\u2019s neighbors are under investigation for links to terrorist organizations and\nthat their houses were searched as a result of the investigation.  Applicant states that he had no\nknowledge of that information when he bought his house, learning of it only from the government\u2019s\nallegations.\n\n3\n\u201cThe government of Iran is controlled by radical Islamic clerics.  The State Department\nreports that the government of Iran has a poor record of protecting human rights.  Iran has a history\nof poor relations with the U.S. because it attempts to acquire nuclear weapons and other weapons\nof mass destruction, supports international terrorism, and opposes the Middle East peace process.\u201d\nDecision at 6.\nB.  Discussion\nDepartment Counsel has not challenged the judge\u2019s findings.  Therefore, they are not an issue\non appeal.  To the extent that the Judge\u2019s findings are relevant to the assigned error, they will be\naddressed below.\nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Ultimate Conclusions\nA Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation\nfor\u201d the decision \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43\n(1983) (quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  \u201c The\ngeneral standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interest\nof national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  The Appeal\nBoard may reverse the Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or revoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.3. \nDepartment Counsel contends that the Judge erred in her application of Guideline B\nDisqualifying and Mitigating Conditions.  In her decision, the Judge correctly found that all of\nApplicant\u2019s immediate family reside in the U.S.  According to the record, only two aunts and cousins\ncurrently reside in Iran.  However, Department Counsel points out that Applicant\u2019s parents, with\nwhom he has a close relationship, travel to Iran regularly and have at least a bank account in Iran.\nDepartment Counsel cites multiple State Department documents in the record regarding the dangers\nto American citizens, particularly those of Iranian birth, who travel to Iran.  Under these\ncircumstances, Department Counsel argues that Applicant\u2019s parents, even though they reside in the\nU.S., raise security concerns which the Judge did not consider.       \nThe major issue is the nature of the Iranian regime itself.  The Board has held that it is error\nfor a Judge to fail to take into consideration a significant aspect of a case.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No.\n02-00318 at 7-8 (App. Bd. Feb. 25, 2004).  While there is generally no requirement that the Judge\ndiscuss every piece of record evidence, a Judge\u2019s conclusions must be based on the record evidence\nas a whole.  Id.  Here, the record evidence includes a significant amount of material about the nature\nof the Iranian regime\u2019s hostility toward the United States, its poor human rights record, and its\nsponsorship of international terrorism.  The Judge briefly refers to that evidence in her findings of\nfact, but makes no mention of it in her conclusions.  The Judge even states, with no explanation, that\n\u201cApplicant, as a U.S. citizen, is unlikely to be put in a position where he would have to choose\nbetween loyalty to the U.S. and his limited family, in Iran.\u201d  Decision at 9.  The Judge\u2019s failure to\n\n4\ntake the nature of the Iranian regime into account in reaching her conclusions renders those\nconclusions arbitrary and capricious.\nLikewise, as Department counsel points out, the Judge\u2019s failure to discuss the nature of the\nIranian regime while performing a whole-person analysis renders that analysis arbitrary and\ncapricious.  To the extent there is some evidence indicative of mitigation, the Judge does not explain\nwhy it outweighs the significant security concerns raised in the case, particularly the poor human\nrights record of the Iranian government.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-12435 at 4 (App. Bd. Apr. 9,\n2007).\nIn addition to the Judge\u2019s failure to address the nature of the Iranian regime, there are several\naspects of Applicant\u2019s conduct and circumstances as well as discrepancies in the evidence which the\nJudge\u2019s conclusions fail to address.  To the extent these matters are addressed in the Judge\u2019s findings\nof fact, the Judge\u2019s conclusions fail to follow rationally from those findings.  However, there is\nsignificant record evidence which is not addressed at all in the Judge\u2019s decision.  \nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s favorable security clearance decision is REVERSED.\nSigned: Michael Y.

WILLIAMS\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nFrancisco Mendez, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\n\n2\nApplicant, a 49-year-old software engineer, was born in Iran. He immigrated to the U.S. in\n1978 and became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1982. He married his wife, a naturalized U.S. citizen,\nin the U.S. His children are U.S. citizens by birth. He renounced his Iranian citizenship in 2005. All\nof his business and financial holdings are in this country. His wife, parents, and siblings are dual\ncitizens of the U.S. and Iran. He has mitigated the security concerns arising from foreign preference\nand foreign influence. Clearance is granted.\n\nEx. 1 (Security Clearance Application, executed April 16, 2003).\n1\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn April 16, 2003, Applicant applied for a security clearance and completed a Security\nClearance Application (SF 86).  On September 6, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n1\n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, pursuant to Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and\nmodified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified. The SOR\ndetailed reasons under Guideline C (Foreign Preference) and Guideline B (Foreign Influence) why\nDOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant and\nrecommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be\ngranted or revoked.\nIn a sworn statement, executed on September 30, 2005, Applicant responded to the SOR\nallegations and requested a hearing. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on April 12, 2007.\nThe case was assigned to me on April 18, 2007. A Notice of Hearing was issued on April 24, 2007,\nscheduling the hearing for May 15, 2007. On May 16, 2007, an Amended Notice of Hearing was\nissued, rescheduling the hearing for May 23, 2007. The hearing was conducted as scheduled. At the\nhearing, the Government offered five exhibits, Exs. 1-5. Applicant offered three exhibits, Exs. A-C.\nAll exhibits were admitted without objection. Prior to the hearing, the Government requested that\nadministrative notice be taken of the content of nine documents (I-IX) about Iran. There being no\nobjection, administrative notice was taken of those facts. The transcript (Tr.) was received on June\n4, 2007.\nMOTION TO AMEND THE STATEMENT OF REASONS\nPrior to the hearing, on March 22, 2007, the Government submitted a Motion to Amend the\nSOR. Pursuant to subparagraph 1 of the SOR, the Government requested adding allegations 1.e and\n1.f:\n1.e  You purchased your house from an individual who is under investigation by the\nUnited States Government for links to terrorist organizations.\n1.f  At least two of your neighbors are under investigation by the United States\nGovernment for links to terrorist organizations and their homes were searched as a\nresult of this investigation.\nAt the hearing, Applicant did not object to the newly added subparagraphs 1.e and 1.f.\nAccordingly, the SOR is amended as stated above.\nSUPPLEMENTAL MOTION TO AMEND THE STATEMENT OF REASONS\n\nTr. 56.\n2\nId. at 55.\n3\nId. at 29.\n4\n4\nPrior to the hearing, on April 17, 2007, the Government submitted a Supplemental Motion\nto Amend the SOR. Pursuant to subparagraph 2 of the SOR, the Government requested adding\nallegations 2.c through 2.g:\n2.c  Your parent-in-law is a dual citizen of the United States and Iran, residing in the\nUnited States.\n2.d  Your wife is a dual citizen of the United States and Iran, residing in the United\nStates.\n2.e  Your parents are dual citizens of the United States and Iran, residing in the\nUnited States.\n2.f  Your two siblings are dual citizens of the United States and Iran, residing in the\nUnited States.\n2.g  That information set forth above in subparagraphs 1.e and 1.f.\nAt the hearing, Applicant did not object to the newly added subparagraphs 2.c through 2.g.\nAccordingly, the SOR is amended as stated above.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted the factual allegations in subparagraphs 1.b, 1.d, 2.a through 2.f. Those\nadmissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. He denied the remaining factual allegations\nin subparagraphs 1.a, 1.d through 1.f, and 2.g. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence\nin the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following findings of fact:\nApplicant is 49 years old and has been employed as a software engineer by a defense\ncontractor since April 2003.  He was born in Iran and immigrated to the U.S. in 1978 at the age of\n2\n18. He received both his undergraduate and graduate degrees from U.S. universities. He became a\nnaturalized U.S. citizen in 1982. He married his wife in 1986 in the U.S.  His wife is a dual citizen\n3\nof the U.S. and Iran. She became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1992. His two children, aged 16 and\n10, were born in the U.S. and are not dual citizens.\nApplicant applied for and was reissued an Iranian passport on December 6, 1998. He used\nhis Iranian passport to enter and exit Iran in at least 1997, 1998, and 2000.  He visited in 1997,\n4\n\nId. at 60.\n5\nId.. at 30.\n6\nId. 23.\n7\nId. at 25.\n8\nId. at 35.\n9\nId. at 36.\n10\nId. at 35.\n11\nId.\n12\nId. at 37.\n13\nId. at 38.\n14\nId. at 39.\n15\nId. at 37.\n16\nId.\n17\nId. at 31.\n18\nId. at 32.\n19\nId.\n20\n5\nbecause his mother-in-law was sick. In 1998, he and his family brought his ill mother-in-law to the\nU.S.  In 2000, he visited Iran because his grandmother passed away.\n5\n6\nApplicant\u2019s in-laws are deceased and thus are not dual citizens.  His mother-in-law passed\n7\naway in 2001 and his father-in-law in 2005.  \n8\nApplicant\u2019s parents are dual citizens of the U.S. and Iran. His father is a retired physician.9\nHis mother is a retired midwife.  His parents visit Iran at about once every other year.  He does not\n10\n11\nknow whether they have any assets in Iran.  He stated that his parents never worked for the Iranian\n12\ngovernment.13\nApplicant is uncertain as to whether his two siblings are dual citizens.  They both reside in\n14\nthe U.S. and were born in Iran. Since living in the U.S., he does not believe that either sibling has\ntraveled to Iran.  His brother works for a large private corporation.  His sister works in real estate.\n15\n16\n17\nApplicant\u2019s two aunts, cousins, and an uncle are citizens and residents of Iran. He has contact\nwith his aunts by telephone once or twice a year.  They have never visited his family here in the\n18\nU.S.  One aunt was a doctor and the other a physical therapist and they are both retired.

He has\n21\ntelephone contact with each cousin about twice a year.  One cousin\u2019s husband is an engineer.  On\n22\n23\nthe SOR, he deleted reference to his uncle because he does not have one. He indicated that neither\naunts nor cousins have ever worked for the Iranian government.24\nThe SOR contends Applicant purchased his house from an individual who is under\ninvestigation by the U.S. Government for links to terrorist organizations. Applicant denied this\nallegation. He testified that prior to getting the SOR, he had no knowledge of this allegation at the\ntime he purchased his home in July 2000.  He worked with a real estate agent to find a home and\n25\nthe agent showed him several homes, including the one he purchased.26\nThe SOR states at least two of Applicant\u2019s neighbors are under investigation by the U.S.\nGovernment for links to terrorist organizations and their homes were searched as a result of this\ninvestigation. Applicant stated he had no knowledge of this allegation at the time he purchased his\nhome. He became aware of this allegation when he received the SOR.27\nApplicant proffered a letter attesting to his character. This individual has known Applicant\nand his family for more than 17 years. He strongly endorses Applicant for a security clearance. He\nstated:\n. . . he [Applicant] deeply cherishes his life in U.S. and is proud of the American\ndemocratic system and the freedom and the ideals that it has offered him and his\nfamily. I believe that [Applicant] is true to his value and principles about the\nprincipals of the U.S. democracy and form of government. He has served this country\nwith dignity, humility and devotion.28\nOn February 9, 2005, when Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the\nDepartment of Defense, he possessed an Iranian passport. In a letter dated February 17, 2005, the\nEmbassy of Pakistan confirmed that Applicant submitted his passport in order to renounce his\nIranian citizenship.  Applicant stated this concerning visits to Iran in the future:  \u201cI have no reason\n29\nto go back [to Iran]. I have no interest and I have no relatives to go back to.\u201d He stated that \u201c[s]ince\n\nTr. 22.\n30\nId. at 34.\n31\nTr. 55.\n32\nAdministrative Notice V (U.S. Department of State, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, Country\n33\nReport on Human Rights Practices 2006: Iran, dated March 6, 2006, at 1-7).\nId. at 7.\n34\n6\nI denounced it [Iranian citizenship], no I\u2019m not a citizen.\u201d  He does not own any real estate in Iran\n30\nnor does he have any other assets there.31\nApplicant has strong attachments to the U.S. He has lived in the U.S. since 1978. He owns\nreal estate in the U.S., valued at $1 to $2 million. He has savings and retirement accounts in the U.S.\nHis children are enrolled in the neighborhood public school system.32\nThe government of Iran is controlled by radical Islamic clerics. The State Department reports\nit has a poor record of protecting human rights.  Iran has a history of poor relations with the U.S.\n33\nbecause it attempts to acquire nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction, supports\ninternational terrorism, and opposes the Middle East peace process.34\nOn August 16, 2000, the Assistant Secretary of Defense, issued the \u201cMoney Memorandum,\u201d\nclarifying certain issues in cases involving possession and/or use of a foreign passport. Pursuant to\nthis memorandum, an applicant possessing a valid foreign passport cannot be granted access to\nclassified information unless he does one of two things: (1) surrenders the passport, or (2) offers\ncredible evidence that he obtained official approval for its use from the appropriate United States\nGovernment agency.\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating\na person\u2019s eligibility to hold a security clearance. Included in the guidelines are disqualifying\nconditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) applicable to each specific guideline. Additionally,\neach security clearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the\nrelevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the factors listed\nin the Directive. Specifically these are: (1) the nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding\ncircumstances; (2) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (3) the age of the applicant; (4) the\nmotivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary,\nor undertaken with knowledge of the consequences; (5) the absence or presence of rehabilitation; and\n(6) the probability that the circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future. Although\nthe presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome\ndeterminative, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured\nagainst this policy guidance.\n\nISCR Case No. 96-0277 (July 11, 1997) at 2.\n35\nISCR Case No. 97-0016 (December 31, 1997) at 3; Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n36\nDepartment of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\n37\nISCR Case No. 94-1075 (August 10, 1995) at 3-4; Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n38\nISCR Case No. 93-1390 (January 27, 1995) at 7-8; Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n39\nEgan, 484 U.S. at 531.\n40\nId.\n41\nId.; Directive, Enclosure 2, \u00b6 E2.2.2.\n42\nExecutive Order 10865 \u00a7 7.\n43\n7\nThe sole purpose of a security clearance determination is to decide if it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an applicant.  The Government\n35\nhas the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of proof is something less than a\n36\npreponderance of evidence.  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant\n37\nto present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against him.38\nAdditionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance\ndecision.39\nNo one has a right to a security clearance  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that\n40\nsecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  Any reasonable\n41\ndoubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved\nin favor of protecting such sensitive information.  The decision to deny an individual a security\n42\nclearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an indication\n43\nthat the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have\nestablished for issuing a clearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all facts in evidence and the legal standards, and I reach the\nfollowing conclusions.\nForeign Preference\nUnder Guideline C, a security risk may exist \u201cwhen an individual acts in such a way as to\nindicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to\nprovide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.\u201d\nThe Government has established a prima facie case under foreign preference. Applicant\nbecame a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1982. He visited Iran in 1997, 1998, and 2000 using his Iranian\npassport during those trips. Thus, he exercised the rights and privileges of a citizen of Iran by using\n\nE2.A2.1.3.1.\n44\n8\nan Iranian passport. Thus, Foreign Preference Disqualifying Condition (FP DC) 1 (the exercise of dual\ncitizenship) and FP DC 2 (possession and/or use of a foreign passport) apply.\nVarious conditions can mitigate a security concerning regarding foreign preference. Applicant\nwas born in Iran and was a citizen of Iran by operation of Iranian law. Thus, Foreign Preference\nMitigating Condition (FP MC) 1 (dual citizenship is based solely on parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in\na foreign country) applies. However, on February 17, 2005, Applicant relinquished his Iranian passport\nto the Pakistani Embassy in order to renounce his citizenship. Consequently, FP MC 4 (individual has\nexpressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship) applies. Moreover, he is in compliance with the\nMoney Memorandum because he surrendered his passport. Accordingly, allegations 1.a through 1.f\nof the SOR are concluded in favor of Applicant. \nForeign Influence\nUnder Guideline B, a security risk may exist \u201cwhen an individual\u2019s immediate family,\nincluding cohabitants, and other persons to whom he or she may be bound by affection, influence, or\nobligation are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress. These situations could\ncreate the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s wife, his parents, and two siblings are citizens of the U.S. They are also citizens\nof Iran because they were born in Iran, and Iran considers them citizens by birth. Thus, Foreign\nInfluence Disqualifying Condition (FI DC) 1 (an immediate family member, or a person to whom the\nindividual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign\ncountry) applies to those family members. An \u201cimmediate family member\u201d is defined to include:\nspouse, father, mother, sons, daughters, brothers, and sisters.  Although Applicant\u2019s aunts and cousins\n44\nare Iranian citizens and residents, they are not defined as immediate family member. Thus, FI DC 1\ndoes not apply to his aunts and cousins.\nVarious factors can mitigate the foreign influence security concern. Applicant has offered\nevidence to support a determination that his wife, parents, and his siblings do not constitute an\nunacceptable security risk. First and foremost, his wife, parents, and siblings are permanent U.S.\ncitizens. The evidence demonstrates that none are agents of a foreign power or politically inclined. As\nfar as he knows, his parents are the only ones who visit Iran. They visit Iran every other year. His father\nis a retired physician and his mother is a retired midwife. These family members have chosen the U.S.\nas their home and none of them have any affiliation with the Iranian government when they lived there,\nor since becoming U.S. citizens. Moreover, Applicant renounced his Iranian citizenship and has no\nplans to visit that country in the future. Applicant, as a U.S. citizen, is unlikely to be put in a position\nwhere he would have to choose between loyalty to the U.S. and his limited family, in Iran. Pursuant\nto Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition (FI MC) 1 it is potentially mitigating where there is (a\ndetermination that the immediate family member(s), (spouse, father, mother, sons, daughters, brothers,\nsisters) cohabitant, or associate(s) in question are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to\nbe exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to\nthe person(s) involved and the United States). Moreover, his communication with his two cousins and\naunts in Iran, is infrequent. Thus, FI MC 3 (contact and correspondence with foreign citizens are\ncasual and infrequent) applies to those relatives who are citizens and residents of Iran.\n\n9\nI considered carefully all the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in this case in\nlight of the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept, keeping in mind that any doubt as to whether access to classified\ninformation is clearly consistent with national security must be resolved in favor or the national\nsecurity. Applicant is a mature individual who has lived in the U.S. for almost 30 years. He has strong\nties to this country, including his profession, his home, bank accounts, and community involvement.\nHis use of his Iranian passport to travel to and from that country in 1997, 1998, and 2000, even though\nhe was a naturalized U.S. citizen since 1982, is a moot issue since he renounced his Irani citizenship\nand relinquished his Iranian passport. Applicant has renounced his Iranian citizenship and has no plans\nto ever visit that country again. He does not have real or personal property in Iran. Applicant\u2019s wife\nis an American citizen, permanently residing in the U.S. Their children were born in the U.S. and do\nnot have dual citizenship in Iran. Applicant\u2019s parents and siblings are U.S. citizens, residing in the U.S.\nI conclude Applicant has mitigated the potential security concerns arising from foreign influence.\nAccordingly, allegations 2.a through 2.f of the SOR are concluded in favor of Applicant.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1. Guideline C (Foreign Preference):\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2.

After a complete review of the record, I make the following findings of fact: Applicant is a 22-year-old employee of a defense contractor who has worked for the company for five years since age 17. He filed his application for a security clearance (SF 86) on October 15, 2002, when he first began work as a sheet metal worker. When he filed his SF 86 he answered \u201cno\u201d to Question 27 asking if he had used drugs in the past seven years or since age 16. He had used marijuana while in high school. The exact dates and frequency for that use was in dispute in the hearing arising from two interviews he had with two government investigators. The first interview with Applicant was on January 20, 2004. He was a source and reference in connection with a national agency check (NACLC) on a person he knew who also was applying 3 for clearance. In the one page information summary sheet (Exh. 4) prepared by the investigator who testified at the hearing it was reported that Applicant stated he used marijuana a couple of times a week between 1999 until the winter of 2002 when he would have been between ages 15 and 17.

Adamson, Personal Representative\n\n2\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant, a 22-year-old employee of a defense contractor for the past five years, failed to\nmitigate security concerns under Guideline E arising from failure to report his drug use at Question\n27 on his 2002 SF 86 yet provided detailed information on many other matters on the application.\nHe also was alleged to have given inconsistent information to two investigators in 2004 and 2006\nregarding the drug use as to frequency and dates but this allegation was mitigated since the evidence\nwas not persuasive that he did so deliberately as required by Guideline E. He mitigated allegations\nunder Guideline J of criminal conduct in 2002 for criminal trespass because of the passage of time\nand his positive conduct for the past four years, and mitigated a criminal violation of 18 U.S.C. 1001\nbecause the evidence did not rise to the level of proof of criminal conduct. Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF CASE\nOn September 22, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, as amended and\nmodified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the\npreliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. DOHA recommended the case be\nreferred to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued,\ndenied, or revoked.\nOn October 13, 2006, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and requested a hearing.\nThe matter was assigned to me on March 26, 2007. A notice of hearing was issued on May 8, 2007,\nfor a hearing on May 30, 2007, and held that day. The government offered four exhibits and\nApplicant offered two at the hearing. All were admitted into evidence. Two investigators testified\nfor the government. Applicant testified on his own behalf. The transcript was received on June 13,\n2007. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted one allegation (SOR \u00b6 2.b.) and denied the other three with explanatory\ninformation. After a complete review of the record, I make the following findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 22-year-old employee of a defense contractor who has worked for the company\nfor five years since age 17. He filed his application for a security clearance (SF 86) on October 15,\n2002, when he first began work as a sheet metal worker. When he filed his SF 86 he answered \u201cno\u201d\nto Question 27 asking if he had used drugs in the past seven years or since age 16. He had used\nmarijuana while in high school. The exact dates and frequency for that use was in dispute in the\nhearing arising from two interviews he had with two government investigators. \nThe first interview with Applicant was on January 20, 2004. He was a source and reference\nin connection with a national agency check (NACLC) on a person he knew who also was applying\n\n3\nfor clearance. In the one page information summary sheet (Exh. 4) prepared by the investigator who\ntestified at the hearing it was reported that Applicant stated he used marijuana a couple of times a\nweek between 1999 until the winter of 2002 when he would have been between ages 15 and 17. He\ndenied telling the investigator the frequency and date of 2002. \nThe investigator was uncertain as to whether the interview was in person or telephonic (Tr.\n119), and Applicant was not given an opportunity to read and review the statement because he was\nonly a source and not the subject of the investigation. While the investigator expressed certainty that\nthe information in the report accurately reflected what she was told by Applicant (Tr. 105), I give\nlimited weight to its accuracy since Applicant had no opportunity to review the report. \nThe second investigation on May 16, 2006, related to Applicant\u2019s own security clearance and\nin that personal subject interview (Exh. 3) the investigator reported that Applicant stated he had used\nmarijuana only twice during 1999 and 2000 while in the woods with friends, had not used it since,\nand had no intention of using it again. \nThe personal subject interview for Applicant also focused on an arrest for criminal trespass\nand criminal mischief in September 2002 one month before his SF 86 was submitted. That incident\nwas reported in detail by Applicant at Questions 23 and 26 on the SF 86 where he noted that action\nwas still pending on the case. He also reported in detail one delinquent debt at Questions 38 and 39.\nThe 2002 arrest is also alleged under Guideline J Criminal Conduct in SOR \u00b6 2.b., his only admitted\nallegation. As a result of this arrest, he was placed on one year unsupervised probation as a youthful\noffender. \nIn the summer of 2003, Applicant was arrested for underage beer drinking at a beach and,\nin the course of the arrest, the police officer discovered marijuana in the pocket of the pants he was\nwearing. He was charged with underage beer drinking and drug possession (Tr. 91-95). This was\nduring his probation period resulting from the 2002 arrest. He was fined for both offenses. While this\nmatter was not alleged in the SOR, it was argued by the government at the hearing in an effort to\nimpeach the credibility of Applicant. He said he had borrowed dry clothing from a friend after they\nhad swam, and the marijuana was in the pocket of the borrowed trousers. \nThe 2006 investigative report (Exh. 3) noted that Applicant stated that \u201che did not have any\nother problems during his one year probation.\u201d He was not given an opportunity to review the report\nwhen it was written, but at the hearing Applicant reviewed it and said no parts were inaccurate or\nincomplete (Tr. 70). He contended he was never specifically asked about the 2003 incident by the\ninvestigator. He did not report the 2003 arrest to either of the investigators, his employer, or his\nsupervisor. He submitted evidence of a company sponsored drug test on October 28, 2002, showing\nno drugs in his system on that date (Exh. A). \nApplicant is single with a high school degree and technical education for the skills he\nperforms. His family consists of his parents, one older brother who lives across the country, and a\ntwo year-old brother with whom he is very close. His family has a long history with the same\ncompany as his grandfather also worked there his entire working life. He is well regarded at his work\nby his supervisor and, despite a few un-excused absences, has good work habits (Exh. B). Applicant\n\n4\ndoes not use drugs, believes they endanger his career at his company, and does not consort with\npeople who do use drugs. He hopes to marry and have a home (Tr. 64). \nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position that will give that person access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527.\nAn evaluation of whether the applicant meets the security guidelines includes consideration\nof the following factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and\nmaturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence\nof rehabilitation and other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential\nfor pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nDirective, \u00b6 E2.2.1. Security clearances are granted only when \u201cit is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to do so.\u201d Executive Order No. 10865 \u00a7 2. See Executive Order No. 12968 \u00a7 3.1(b).\nInitially, the government must establish, by something less than a preponderance of the\nevidence, that conditions exist in the personal or professional history of the applicant which\ndisqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information\nSee Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. The applicant then bears the burden of demonstrating it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance. \u201cAny doubt as to\nwhether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved\nin favor of the national security.\u201d Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.2. \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should\nerr, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. See Executive Order No. 12968 \u00a7\n3.1(b).\nCONCLUSIONS\nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate\nadjudicative factors, I conclude the following with respect to all allegations set forth in the SOR:\nApplicant\u2019s admitted drug use within seven years of filing his SF 86, his failure to report it\nat Question 27 of his SF 86, and alleged failure to fully inform investigators of frequency and dates\nof his drug use, prompted security concerns under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective September 1, 2006. Such conduct might indicate questionable\njudgment, unreliability, and unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations and could indicate\nthat the person may not properly safeguard classified information (AG 15). Specifically, conditions\nthat could raise a security concern and be disqualifying include the deliberate omission, concealment,\nor falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire (AG 16 a).\nAlso the deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts in a\n\n5\npersonnel security interview could raise a security concern and be disqualifying (AG 16 b). \nThere are several mitigating conditions in Guideline E, but none are applicable. In view of\nthe detail of other answers he gave on the SF 86 to other questions, the omission of information\nabout drug use at Question 27 is difficult to explain. Thus, I conclude against Applicant as to SOR\n\u00b6 1.a. As to the allegation in SOR 1.b. relating to the inconsistent reports of the two investigators in\n2004 and 2006, the differences in the detail given to the two investigators as stated in their reports\nis understandable since the first was only a character reference inquiry for another person and the\ndetail of the response of Applicant as to his own conduct was secondary to the purposes of the\ninquiry and not of great significance to either Applicant or the investigator. I find in his favor as to\nthat allegation. \nAlso alleged is security concern under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) relating to (SOR 2.a.)\nthe criminal trespass arrest in 2002, five years ago when he was 17-years-old, and (SOR 2.b.) as a\ncriminal violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 regarding the allegations in SOR \u00b6 1 relating to the failure\nto report marijuana use on his SF 86 and the inconsistency in information provided to the two\ninvestigators regarding the dates and frequency of use. Such conduct might create doubts about a\nperson\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. It calls into question a person\u2019s ability or\nwillingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations (AG 30). Conditions that could raise a\nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying include an allegation or admission of criminal conduct\n(AG 31 c).\nMitigating conditions (MC) might apply if so much time has elapsed since the criminal\nbehavior happened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and\ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgement (AG 32 a).\nAnother MC provides mitigation if there is evidence of successful rehabilitation without recurrence\nof criminal activity, remorse, and a good employment record. Since the allegation of criminal\nconduct alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.b. occurred five years ago and the second un-alleged arrest during his\nprobation, occurred four years ago, and under circumstances unlikely to recur since Applicant is now\nolder and more mature with a good employment record, I find that both mitigating conditions are\napplicable. \nAs to the allegation in SOR \u00b6 2.a. relating to 18 U.S.C. 1001, I conclude that the evidence\nproduced regarding SOR\u00b6 1 does not rise to level required for establishing criminal conduct.\nIn all adjudications the protection of our national security is of paramount concern. Persons\nwho have access to classified information have an overriding responsibility for the security concerns\nof the nation. The objective of the security clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense\nassessment of a person\u2019s trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information. \nThe \u201cwhole person\u201d concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of their acts\nand omissions. Each case must be judged on its own merits taking into consideration all relevant\ncircumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis. Applicant is a\nyoung man who, at age 22, has already been employed in a stable and productive position for five\nyears. The events that gave rise to this proceeding occurred during his teenage years. His drug use\noccurred during high school years. However, the failure to report drug use on the SF 86, when he\nwas recently in high school when the use occurred despite the accuracy of other responses on the SF\n\n6\n86, precludes application of the whole person mitigation. The failure to report the 2003 drug\npossession arrest during his period probation in the 2006 investigation indicates his intention to\nminimize drug use at the expense of the requirement to provide full and frank answers to an\ninvestigator.\nAfter considering all the evidence in its totality, including the whole person of Applicant, I\nconclude that it is premature to grant a security clearance.\nFORMAL FINDINGS \nFormal findings as required by the Directive (Par. E3.1.25) are as follows:\nParagraph 1. Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2. Guideline J:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b.:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or renew a security clearance for Applicant. Clearance\nis denied. \nCharles D. Ablard \nAdministrative Judge\n",

Clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on February 21, \n2003. On August 1, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \na Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guidelines M, E, \nand J for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and modified, \nand Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive).  \n \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on August 8, 2006. He answered the \nSOR in writing through counsel on August 28, 2006, and requested a hearing before an \nAdministrative Judge. DOHA received the request on August 30, 2006. Department \n \n1 \n \n \nApril 30, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \nCounsel was prepared to proceed on February 12, 2007, and I received the case \nassignment on February 13, 2007. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on March 30, 2007, \nscheduling the case to be heard on May 9, 2007. The hearing was held as scheduled. \n \nThe government offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 26, which were \nreceived without objection with the exception of GE 19. Counsel for Applicant objected \nto GE 19 on the basis of authenticity. After argument by counsel, I overruled Counsel for \nApplicant\u2019s objection. Also, because GE 20 consisted of two different parts, it was \nmarked GE 20(a) and 20(b) for clarification purposes. Tr. 18-24, 142-144. Applicant \ntestified on his own behalf and offered Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through Z, without \nobjection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on May 25, 2007.  \n \nBefore the hearing adjourned I held the record open to allow both counsel an \nopportunity to submit written closing arguments. Department Counsel\u2019s closing \nargument is marked Exhibit (Ex.) I, and Counsel for Applicant\u2019s closing argument is \nmarked Ex. II. The record closed on June 14, 2007. Based upon a review of the case \nfile, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied. \n \nProcedural Rulings \n \nMotion to Amend SOR \n \nDepartment Counsel moved to amend the SOR by withdrawing \u00b6 2.d., which \nalleged Applicant was investigated by Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS) \nconcerning several files deleted from his employer\u2019s common access drive and cutting \ntools found to be missing after his employment terminated in March 2001. Without \nobjection from Counsel for Applicant, I granted Department Counsel\u2019s motion to \nwithdraw  \u00b6 2.d.,   Tr. 239-242. \n  \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated August 28, 2006, Applicant denied all factual \nallegations alleged in the SOR.  After a thorough review of the pleadings, exhibits, and \ntestimony I make the following findings of fact: \n \n \nApplicant is a 53-year-old Advisory Engineer, who has been employed by his \ndefense contractor employer since March 2002. He seeks to renew his security \nclearance and currently holds a secret security clearance, which was initially granted in \nJuly 1991. GE 1, Tr. 158-159.  \n \n \nApplicant was born, raised and educated in India. He received his undergraduate \neducation in India and was awarded a Bachelor of Science degree, majoring in \nMechanical Engineering, in May 1975. He attended graduate school in the U.S. and \nreceived his Master\u2019s Degree in Mechanical Engineering, in August 1981. He completed \nhis graduate work in India and was awarded his Ph.D. in Metallurgical Engineering, in \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                                          \nFebruary 1982. GE 5, Tr. 26-27, 160-161. English is Applicant\u2019s second language. At \nhome, Applicant speaks a mix of English and \u201clocal Indian language.\u201d Tr. 162. \n \n \nApplicant was married in August 1979. He and his wife have two adult children, a \ndaughter and a son, both in their mid-twenties. GE 1, Tr. 157-158.  \n \n \nApplicant was employed at a major state university (university) from March 1, \n1984 until he was involuntarily terminated on March 21, 2001. During the 17 years \nApplicant was employed at the university, he held three different titles, Head of Surface \nTechnologies Department, Professor of Engineering Science and Mechanics, and \nSenior Scientist. Tr. 26-27, 162-163, GE 7. Evidence submitted by Applicant supports \nthe notion that he was viewed as a valued employee for the vast majority of his \nuniversity employment. AE F through O. Some time before he was terminated, his \nrelationship with his superior deteriorated, which lead to his being involuntarily \nterminated for \u201cinsubordination.\u201d1 GE 7.  \n \n \nOn March 21, 2001, Applicant was summoned to a meeting with university \nofficials. When he arrived at the meeting, he was informed he could resign with a \nseverance package, or be involuntarily terminated. He refused to resign and was \ninvoluntarily terminated. Tr. 28-30.  After working hours that same day, Applicant \nreturned to his work site to collect his personal belongings and clean out his office.  \n \n \nWhat occurred when Applicant returned to his office is a topic of dispute. Shortly \nafter Applicant left the university, university officials notified NCIS of the improper \ndeletion of numerous sensitive, but unclassified, U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps \nresearch files and folders on a shared network drive. Applicant was believed \nresponsible for the improper deletion of the computer files, which occurred on the date \nof Applicant\u2019s termination on March 21, 2001. NCIS conducted an investigation, which is \ndocumented in various government exhibits. GE 22 through 26. \n \n \nThe SOR referred to three interviews2. Salient portions of those interviews are \nquoted verbatim in order of chronology3: \n \n1 Department Counsel and Counsel for Applicant dedicated portions of their written closing \narguments to discussing the underlying basis for Applicant\u2019s termination from state university. Ex. I, pgs. \n1-4; Ex. II, pgs. 10-14. Regardless of what label is applied as the reason Application left university, the \nfact remains that he was involuntarily terminated on March 21, 2001. Furthermore, he unsuccessfully \nchallenged his termination seeking relief from state/federal administrative/judicial bodies. Applicant\u2019s most \nrecent unsuccessful challenge occurred when the Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against him by their \nDecision on June 30, 2004. GE 11. See also GE 7 through 11, which contain administrative and judicial \ndecisions pertaining to Applicant\u2019s unsuccessful challenges to his termination. \n \n2 I find that all Applicant interviews referred to in this Decision were prepared consistent with \nexisting DoD policy and were provided freely and voluntarily. Tr. 147. See also testimony of DSS Special \nAgent, who administered Applicant\u2019s two October 2005 signed, sworn statements. Tr. 175-195 \n \n3 Quoting the Applicant/source documents was chosen versus summarization to accurately reflect \nwhat was, in fact, said. It also demonstrates the contrast in Applicant\u2019s statements. Also, See Applicant\u2019s \ntestimony. Tr. 25-168.  \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nAugust 9, 2001 NCIS Interview. 4 \n \n[Applicant] advised that after receiving this news (being involuntarily \nterminated) he walked around the campus for a short period and \neventually returned to his office [at university]. [Applicant] reported that \nwhen he returned to his office he didn\u2019t touch anything and telephoned his \nwife. Following the telephone call he claimed that he left the office at \napproximately 5:10-15pm and went to get his wife to tell her about the \nfiring. [Applicant] claimed that he and his wife went directly home and that \nhe did not return to the campus until 6:45-7:00 pm. [Applicant] said that \nwhen he returned to the campus he merely wanted to collect his many \npersonal belongings and clean out his office. [Applicant] reported that he \ntook plastic garbage bags from home to use when he threw away personal \nitems only. [Applicant] said he didn\u2019t see anyone upon his return aside \nfrom one new employee. [Applicant] advised that he then removed his \nbooks, thesis papers, etc., and took them to his car and threw away \nmagazines and other periodicals. He also claimed that he deleted \npersonal e-mails from the computer network. According to [Applicant], \nhe also deleted his personal papers, thoughts and ideas from the \ncomputer in his office. [Applicant] adamantly denied destroying non-\npersonal research data, tool specimens or other Government \nprogram material. [Applicant] confirmed that a \u201cbios\u201d password existed \non the local machines hard drive and stated he felt confident that no one, \nother than he, could gain access to the data on his work computer. \n[Applicant] concluded by stating that his computer was on when he left to \nattend the meeting with [university officials] and that he didn\u2019t touch it \nagain until after he returned from home at approximately 6:45-7:00 pm. \n \nFollowing the above interview, [Applicant\u2019s attorney] was provided with an \nExcel spreadsheet that shows a significant amount of files, to include \nprogram related items, files and folders, being deleted on March 21, 2001 \nfrom approximately 3:18 pm through 10:09 pm. [Applicant\u2019s attorney] \nasked reporting agent if he could consult further with his client prior to \nanswering specific questions relating to file deletions. [Applicant\u2019s \nattorney] also stated that his client would be available in the future to \nanswer additional questions regarding this matter after reviewing the \ndeleted file list. GE 23, pgs. 4-5. (SOR \u00b6 2.c.) \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                           \n \n4 This interview was conducted in the presence of Applicant\u2019s attorney and was prepared by the \nreporting agent as a summarized result of interview.  \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nOctober 20, 2005 Interview.5 \n \nI did not delete or destroy computerized record (sic) from [a \nuniversity] computer that contained US Navy proprietary information \nthat dealt with aircraft engine parts and components. I did not delete \nfiles from the [university] shared network. I have been told by [DSS \nSpecial Agent] that NCIS agents said I was accused of deleting or \ndestroying over 3500 files at [university] after my termination. I deny this. \nGE 5, pg. 2. \n \nJanuary 26 2006 Interview.6 \n \nOn the day that I was fired, I was called to meet with [university\u2019s] Human \nResources Manager (HRM). I was told the reason for the meeting was to \ndiscuss some issues that I had raised such as my complaint of \ndiscrimination, credit due for my patents, etc. When I went to [HRM\u2019s] \noffice, [Second Level Supervisor(SLS)] was also in my office. I must say \nthat I was surprised to see [SLS] in the office. He was my second level \nsupervisor. I was asked to resign my position at [university]. I was told that \nif I did not resign, then I would be fired immediately. I chose not to resign, \nso I was told that I was fired. I understood that I was fired within seconds \nand I asked [HRM] for the letter notifying me that I was fired and the \nreason(s) for my termination. I was told that there was no letter, but I could \nreturn on another day for written notice of my termination. I indicated that I \nwould return the following day. After leaving [HRM\u2019s] office, I picked up my \nwife from her workplace. I told her that I had just been fired from my job \nand it was like she was in shock. She didn\u2019t say a word. We drove home \nand talked some more about what had happened to me. I told her that I \nplanned to visit with [university officials] the following day. I did not feel \nwhat they did to me was right. I received no warning and I was deceived \nabout the true reason of my meeting with [HRM]. \n \nThe more I thought about what had happened, I came to the decision to \ngo back to my office that evening in order to gather my personal \nbelongings. I went at night because I felt it might be difficult for me to face \nmy colleagues the following day. I estimate that I arrived at my office at \napproximately 6:00 PM that same day that I was terminated. I remained at \nmy office for about 90 minutes, which meant that I left at about 7:30 PM. \nWhile in my office, I gathered my belongings. I found some boxes and \nsome garbage bags for trash and/or my personal effects. Some of the \n                                                          \n5 This Applicant interview is a signed, sworn, statement conducted by a Special Agent of the \nDefense Security Service (DSS).  \n \n6 This Applicant interview is a signed, sworn statement that was taken before a scheduled DSS \npolygraph. In light of Applicant\u2019s admissions, the polygraph phase of the examination was not conducted. \nGE 3, GE 4. \n\n \n6 \n \n \nitems that I collected were numerous professional books. Some of these \nbooks belonged to me and some belonged to [university libraries]. My \nintention for gathering the library books was so that I could return them to \nthe respective library. I estimate that there were approximately 10 to 15 \nlibrary books in total. I did in fact return all of these books to their \nrespective library. Earlier today, I told [DSS Special Agent] that I did in fact \ndelete most or all of my email from my [university] office computer that \nnight. I felt that no one needed access to my email. I also searched for \nand deleted numerous files that I had created and stored on my local \ncomputer drive. I explained that these files although professional in nature, \nwere my thoughts, ideas, etc and were not any of the estimated 3500 \nmissing files in question that were stored on the common access drive. \n(The files that contained US Navy/DoD related information.) I stated that \nwith some of these smaller documents, I printed some of them for my \nfuture use. I explained to [DSS Special Agent] that as a professor, I \nneeded to be on the cutting edge. I also stated that I did not want anyone \nelse to have access to my ideas and thoughts. I also acknowledged to \n[DSS Special Agent] earlier today that it was very possible that I had \ndeleted some files located on the common access drive, but it was done \naccidentally. In other words, I was in a hurry. I had also told [DSS Special \nAgent] that although I am a scientist, I am not as knowledgeable about \ncomputers as other people are. I told [DSS Special Agent] earlier today \nthat I did not delete any files out of anger or revenge. I also explained that \nsome files not found on the common access drive might have also been \nones on my local drive that were deleted. \n \n[DSS Special Agent] provided me with a break to obtain something to eat. \nUpon my return, he began to review with me the polygraph examination \nquestions. The first question that he read was \u201cDid you delete any of those \n[university] common access computer files on purpose that night?\u201d I \nanswered \u201cYes\u201d. In talking with [DSS Special Agent] further about this \nmatter, I admitted that I did in fact deliberately delete many files that \nwere stored on the [university] common access drive. I have been told \nseveral times that it was reported that approximately 3500 or more files \nwere deleted from the [university] common access drive during the \nevening hours on the day I was terminated. These files reportedly \ncontained US Navy/DoD related information. [DSS Special Agent] \ninformed me today that one estimate indicated that the deletion or damage \nof these files caused an approximate loss of $20,000 to [university]. [DSS \nSpecial Agent] has further told me that the US Attorney declined to \nprosecute me because a majority of the files were recovered. As indicated \nabove, I did in fact delete multiple files from the [university] common \naccess drive. I honestly did not count the number files that I deleted. I \ndon\u2019t believe that the number of deleted files was as high as 3500, but I \ncannot state for sure the number of files that I deleted. Nonetheless, I \nnow admit that the many of the missing files in question were files \n\n \n7 \n \n \n                                                          \nthat I deleted on the [university] common access drive. At the time \nthat I deleted these files that were stored on the [state university] \ncommon access drive, I felt that it was my information that I had \ndeveloped and no one else had a right to access it. I did not believe \nthat the information belonged to [university] or the US Navy. I \nacknowledge that the [university] and the US Navy had a different opinion \nabout the deleted files and they believed that it was proprietary information \nthat belonged to the USN / [university]. Although I did not believe it at the \ntime, I can now understand how they could think that they had rights to the \ninformation contained in the files that I deleted. I want to further state that I \nnow have no qualms about the US Navy / [university\u2019s] opinion that the \ninformation belonged to them. After all, I used their computer(s), their \nfacilities, etc. I told [DSS Special Agent] that if I could do it all over again, I \nwould not have deleted those files. I want to go on record and state that I \nwould never do something like this again in the future. Also, while at lunch \ntoday, I thought about a situation with my daughter that occurred several \nyears ago. She told me that I was stubborn. The more I thought about this \ntoday, I began to think that perhaps this could apply to this situation with \nthe [university] missing computer files. Earlier today, I told [DSS Special \nAgent] that I did not delete any files out of anger or hostility for being fired, \nbut I admit that perhaps that is not realistic. Perhaps out of my \n\u201cstubbornness\u201d, I have been in a denial mode that I was angry at the time \nof my termination, but maybe was truly angry. At the very least, as \nindicated above, I did not want people to have access to the information \nthat I had worked on over the years. \n \nI acknowledge that [DSS Special Agent(1)7] interviewed me on 20 and 26 \nOctober 05 as part of my DoD security clearance investigation. When \n[DSS Special Agent] called me, she gave me a general idea of what we \nwould be talking about. I provided a brief explanation to her over the \nphone and she asked me to prepare an explanation in writing and bring it \nto our interview. I did in fact prepare written responses and these are \nincorporated into my sworn written statement, dated 20 Oct 05. In that \nsworn written statement, it reflects on page two of five that I did not delete \nor destroy computerized records from [university] computer that contained \nUS Navy proprietary information that dealt with aircraft engine parts and \ncomponents. I further indicated that I did not delete files from the \n[university] shared network. I indicated that [DSS Special Agent] informed \nme that I was suspected or accused of deleting or destroying an estimated \n3500 files at [university] and I denied this allegation. On page four of five, I \nindicated that although I deleted my personal emails, I did not delete any \nfiles related to my work. I explained that I had an informal meeting with the \n \n7 The DSS Special Agent, who took Applicant\u2019s signed, sworn statement on October 20 and 26, \n2005 was a different Agent than the Agent who took Applicant\u2019s January 26, 2006 signed, sworn \nstatement. \n\n \n8 \n \n \nNCIS in my attorney\u2019s office and I had reiterated that I did not delete any \nfiles related to my work. \n \n[DSS Special Agent] pointed out to me that there is a large difference \nbetween what I told [DSS Special Agent(1)] and what I told him today. In \ntrying to explain the differences in my statements, I told him that there was \nno intent to lie to [DSS Special Agent(1)] or deliberately omit critical \ninformation. I explained to [DSS Special Agent] that at the time of my \ninterview with [DSS Special Agent(1)], I still did not believe that the files I \ndeleted were proprietary information belonging to the US Navy or \n[university]. Even though my previous statement clearly reads that I only \ndeleted email and I did not delete any files related to my work, I did not \nthink of the fact that I did delete various professional files from the \ncommon access drive. I understand that persons reading my statements \nmight come to the conclusion that I was not honest with [DSS Special \nAgent(1)], but I did not lie to her or provide a false statement. Listening to \n[DSS Special Agent] today, it helped me to re-think what happened and to \nthink about perceptions versus reality. My perception was different from \nthe US Navy or [university\u2019s] perception of what happened. GE 2, pgs. 2-5 \n(emphasis added). \n \nOn the evening Applicant deleted files from the common access drive, he printed \ndocuments for his future use and acknowledged he \u201cmay have printed something less \nthan five, small documents.\u201d Tr. 37-38. (SOR \u00b6 1.b.) \n \nWhen Applicant was hired by the university, he executed a Loyalty Oath. GE \n20(a). At his hearing, he acknowledged that any intellectual property he created during \nthe course of his employment with the university belonged to the university. Tr. 118-119. \nHe executed an Agreement Concerning Proprietary Rights with the university on March \n2, 1984, which elaborated on this notion. GE 20(b). The university also has established \npolicy restrictions on the use of the university computer system and sanctions for failing \nto comply with university policies. Tr. 138-141. See university computer and network \nsecurity policy document, GE 21.  \n \nAt his hearing, Applicant deviated from his admission in the January 2006 \nInterview. In an effort to capture the essence of Applicant\u2019s position, I summarized his \nposition with him at his hearing. Applicant testified he only deleted his personal e-mails \nfrom his university computer account, i.e. if it had a \u201cFrom\u201d or \u201cTo\u201d line, he considered \nthe e-mail to be personal and if an e-mail had an attachment, it was \u201celiminated \nautomatically.\u201d Applicant now understands personal to mean e-mails which would \ninclude such things as an e-mail to his wife or his children or planning for a picnic. He \nadded that \u201canything research-related\u201d or \u201cproject-related\u201d was non-personal. \u201cBut that \nwas not my understanding when I was deleting those files. I thought this was all my \npersonal communication. And it is a broader meaning of the word personal that I had on \nmy mind.\u201d Tr. 166-167. See also Applicant\u2019s testimony, Tr. 25-167; Department \n\n \n9 \n \n \nCounsel\u2019s closing argument (Ex. I), pgs. 16-26; and Counsel for Applicant\u2019s closing \nargument (Ex. II), pgs. 16-31. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. The entire process \nincludes a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person \nconcept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \nE2.2.2. requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt as to whether access to classified information is \nclearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nIn reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, \nlogical and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided \ndrawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \n\n \n10 \n \n \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline M, Misuse of Information Technology Systems \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Misuse of Information \nTechnology Systems is set out in AG & E2.A13.1.1.:       \n \nNoncompliance with rules, procedures, guidelines or regulations \npertaining to information technology systems may raise security concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s trustworthiness, willingness, and ability to properly \nprotect classified systems, networks, and information. Information \nTechnology Systems include all related equipment used for the \ncommunication, transmission, processing, manipulation, and storage of \nclassified or sensitive information.  \n \nThe applicable guideline lists four Disqualifying Conditions that could raise \nsecurity concerns. Under AG & E2.A13.1.2.: \n \nAG E2.A13.1.2.1. (IT DC 1): Illegal or unauthorized entry into any \ninformation technology system; \n \nAG E2.A13.1.2.2. (IT DC 2): Illegal or unauthorized modification, \ndestruction, manipulation, or denial of access to information residing on an \ninformation technology system; \n \nAG E2A13.1.2.3. (IT DC 3): Removal (or use) of hardware, software or \nmedia from any information technology system without authorization, \nwhen specifically prohibited by rules, procedures, guidelines or \nregulations; and \n \nAG E2.A13.1.2.4. (IT DC 4): Introduction of hardware, software or media \ninto any information technology system without authorization, when \nspecifically prohibited by rules, procedures, guidelines or regulations. \n \nAG E2.A13.1.3. lists four Mitigating Conditions under this concern: \n \nAG E2.A13.1.3.1. (IT MC 1): The misuse was not recent or significant; \n \nAG E2.A13.1.3.2. (IT MC 2): The conduct was unintentional or \ninadvertent; \n \nAG E2.A13.1.3.3. (IT MC 3): The introduction or removal of media was \nauthorized;  \n\n \n11 \n \n \n \nAG 32.A13.1.3.4. (IT MC 4): The misuse was an isolated event; and \n \nAG E2.A13.1.3.5. (IT MC 5): The misuse was followed by a prompt, good \nfaith effort to correct the situation. \n \n \nHaving carefully reviewed the evidence, I conclude Applicant intentionally deleted \nU.S. Navy proprietary files, containing unclassified, but military critical information, from \na shared database from his employer\u2019s computer without permission after he was \ninvoluntarily terminated from university on March 21, 2001. (SOR \u00b6 1.a.) Having made \nthis finding, application of IT DC 3 cited supra is the most pertinent Disqualifying \nCondition. I do not accept Applicant\u2019s explanations, particularly those offered at his \nhearing. Weighing heavily against him were his admissions contained in his January 26, \n2006 pre-polygraph statement to DSS. GE 2. See Guideline E discussion infra.  \n \n \nInsufficient evidence was developed regarding the nature and quality of the \napproximate five documents Applicant printed following his involuntary termination on \nMarch 21, 2001. (SOR \u00b6 1.b.) Viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the \nApplicant, I find application of any Disqualifying Conditions to SOR \u00b6 1.b. unwarranted.  \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG & E2.A5.1.1.:       \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, \nlack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard \nclassified information. The following will normally result in an unfavorable \nclearance action or administrative termination of further processing for \nclearance eligibility:  \n \nAG E2.A5.1.1.1. Refusal to undergo or cooperate with required security \nprocessing, including medical and psychological testing; or  \n \nE2.A5.1.1.2. Refusal to complete required security forms, releases, or \nprovide full, frank and truthful answers to lawful questions of investigators, \nsecurity officials or other official representatives in connection with a \npersonnel security or trustworthiness determination. \n \nThe applicable guideline lists six Disqualifying Conditions that could raise \nsecurity concerns under AG & E2.A5.1.2.: \n \nAG E2.A5.1.2.1. (DC PC 1): Reliable, unfavorable information provided by \nassociates, employers, coworkers, neighbors, and other acquaintances;  \n \n\n \n12 \n \n \nAG E2.A5.1.2.2. (DC PC 2): The deliberate omission, concealment, or \nfalsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security \nquestionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct \ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or \nstatus, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award \nfiduciary responsibilities; \n \nAG E2.A5.1.2.3. (DC PC 3): Deliberately providing false or misleading \ninformation concerning relevant and material matters to an investigator, \nsecurity \nofficial, \ncompetent \nmedical \nauthority, \nor \nother \nofficial \nrepresentative in connection with a personnel security or trustworthiness \ndetermination; \n \nAG E2.A5.1.2.4. (DC PC 4): Personal conduct or concealment of \ninformation that increases an individual\u2019s vulnerability to coercion, \nexploitation or duress, such as engaging in activities which, if known, may \naffect the person\u2019s personal, professional, or community standing or \nrender the person susceptible to blackmail;  \n \nAG E2.A5.1.2.5. (DC PC 5): A pattern of dishonesty or rule violations, \nincluding violation of any written or recorded agreement made between \nthe individual and the agency; and \n \nAG E2.A5.1.2.6. (DC PC 6): Association with persons involved in criminal \nactivity. \n \nAG E2.A5.1.3. lists seven Mitigating Conditions under this concern: \n \nAG E2.A5.1.3.1. (MC PC 1): The information was unsubstantiated or not \npertinent to a determination of judgment, trustworthiness, or reliability; \n \nAG E2.A5.1.3.2. (MC PC 2): The falsification was an isolated incident, was \nnot recent, and the individual has subsequently provided correct \ninformation voluntarily;  \n \nAG E2.A5.1.3.3. (MC PC 3): The individual made prompt, good-faith \nefforts to correct the falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \nAG E2.A5.1.3.4. (MC PC 4): Omission of material facts was caused or \nsignificantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of authorized \npersonnel, and the previously omitted information was promptly and fully \nprovided; \n \nAG E2.A5.1.3.5. (MC PC 5): The individual has taken positive steps to \nsignificantly reduce or eliminate vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; \n\n \n13 \n \n \n \nAG E2.A5.1.3.6. (MC PC 6): A refusal to cooperate was based on advice \nfrom legal counsel or other officials that the individual was not required to \ncomply with security processing requirements and, upon being made \naware of the requirement, fully and truthfully provided the requested \ninformation; and \n \nAG E2.A5.1.3.7. (MC PC 7): Association with persons involved in criminal \nactivities has ceased. \n \nApplicant\u2019s involuntary termination from university on March 21, 2001 was clearly \nestablished by the evidence. (SOR \u00b6 2.a) Both counsel dedicated portions of their \nwritten closing arguments discussing the characterization of Applicant\u2019s termination. \nRegardless of how one chooses to characterize his termination, the fact remains \nApplicant was involuntarily terminated and all of his subsequent administrative and \njudicial appeals were unsuccessful. These facts warrant application of DC PC 1 as a \nDisqualifying Condition. However, having concluded DC PC 1 is applicable, I cannot \nignore the fact Applicant had a very successful 16-year career with university until he \nwas involuntarily terminated, and also has had a seven-year successful career with his \nsubsequent employer. I do not view Applicant\u2019s difficulties with university as systemic or \nongoing. While none of the Mitigating Conditions under this concern appear particularly \non point, mitigation is available to Applicant under the \u201cWhole Person\u201d discussed infra. \n \nThe Government withdrew SOR \u00b6 2.b. Accordingly, further discussion regarding \nthis allegation is not warranted. \n \nThis brings the discussion to the gravamen of this case, i.e. Applicant\u2019s honesty \nand credibility which are brought into question by SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.c. through 2.e. As alleged, \nApplicant initially denied deleting numerous files containing proprietary information in his \nAugust 9, 2001 and October 20, 2005 interviews, and initially at his pre-polygraph \nJanuary 26, 2006 interview. With the exception of his August 9, 2001 interview, which is \nsummarized, the remaining October 20, 2006 and January 26, 2006 interviews are \nsigned, sworn statements. The interviews/statements cited verbatim supra with \nemphasis added clearly demonstrate a significant disparity from what Applicant was \ninitially reporting to Government investigators versus what he reported in his January \n26, 2006 interview. \n \nIn evaluating which explanation deserves greater weight, I reviewed each \nstatement under the context in which it was provided. The August 9, 2001 interview was \nconducted approximately five months after Applicant was involuntarily terminated from \nuniversity, and Applicant\u2019s counsel was present during this interview. In Applicant\u2019s \nOctober 20, 2005 interview, he again reiterated his earlier denial. Almost five years after \nbeing involuntarily terminated and in conjunction with the renewal of his security \nclearance, Applicant was interviewed on January 26, 2006. On this day, Applicant was \nscheduled to take a polygraph examination and before administering the examination, \nthe DSS Special Agent/Polygrapher interviewed Applicant. This interview resulted in \n\n \n14 \n \n \nApplicant conceding that he deliberately deleted proprietary information on the day he \nwas involuntarily terminated. Applicant\u2019s admissions were reduced to writing and were \nincriminating. See Applicant\u2019s verbatim statements under Findings of Fact supra.  \n \nWhat appears more plausible is Applicant\u2019s January 26, 2006 version of what \nhappened. Understandably, Applicant was distraught and angry after being involuntarily \nterminated from a job he had successfully held for 17 years. Without belaboring the \nunderlying reasons Applicant provided surrounding his termination, he considered the \nwork he deleted to be his and furthermore that no one had a right to access it. The \nevidence establishes and Applicant concedes the information on the university\u2019s \ncommon access drive was proprietary information that belonged to the university.  \n \nI do not accept Applicant\u2019s subsequent statements that whatever he deleted was \n\u201cpersonal,\u201d \u201cinadvertent,\u201d or \u201cunintentional.\u201d He was and is an intelligent, well educated \nperson. I also note Applicant spent his working life in the U.S. and was a tenured \nprofessor with a Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering. He conducted his professional life \nspeaking, reading and writing in English and he is credited with numerous publications. \nIt is unfortunate Applicant chose to destroy the proprietary information he did. No doubt, \nif given the choice to relive March 21, 2001 again, he would choose differently. That \nchoice placed him in a position that required him to later admit or deny his wrongdoing. \nAgain, he made a choice that had repercussions. After reviewing the evidence, \napplication of DC PC 3, DC PC 4, and DC PC 5 appear most appropriate. No Mitigating \nConditions under this concern are applicable supra. \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in \nAG & E2.A10.1.1.: \n \nA history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s \njudgment, reliability and trustworthiness.  \n \nThe applicable guideline lists two Disqualifying Conditions (CC DC) that could \nraise security concerns under AG & E2.A10.1.2.: \n \nAG E2.A10.1.2.1. (CC DC 1): Allegations or admission of criminal \nconduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged; and \n \nAG E2.A10.1.2.2. (CC DC 2): A single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses. \n \nAG E2.A10.1.3. lists six Mitigating Conditions under this concern: \n \nAG E2.A10.1.3.1. (CC MC 1): The criminal behavior was not recent; \n \nAG E2.A10.1.3.2. (CC MC 2): The crime was an isolated incident; \n \n\n \n15 \n \n \n                                                          \nAG E2.A10.1.3.3. (CC MC 3): The person was pressured or coerced into \ncommitting the act and those pressures are no longer in that person\u2019s life; \n \nAG E2.A10.1.3.4. (CC MC 4): The person did not voluntarily commit the \nact and/or the factors leading to the violation are not likely to recur; \n \nAG E2.A10.1.3.5. (CC MC 5): Acquittal; and \n \nAG E2.A10.1.3.6. (CC MC 6): There is clear evidence of successful \nrehabilitation. \n \nBy its very nature, this concern calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness \nto comply with laws, rules, and regulations. The government established its case under \nthis concern by showing that Applicant falsified his interview(s)/sworn statement(s) as \nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.c., 2.d., and 2.e. I find, as discussed supra under Guideline E, that \nApplicant deliberately falsified these interview(s)/sworn statement(s). His falsifications \nare material and a violation of 18 USC \u00a7 1001, a felony.8 \n \nApplicant\u2019s recent falsifications bring to the forefront the criminal conduct \nconcerns raised by his past behavior. I am required to consider Applicant\u2019s overall \nquestionable behavior when evaluating the seriousness of the conduct alleged in the \nSOR to determine factors such as the extent to which his behavior is recent, the \nlikelihood of recurrence; and Applicant\u2019s explanations concerning the circumstances of \nthe incidents alleged.9 \n \nUnder the totality of the circumstances, I find Applicant\u2019s criminal behavior is \nrecent and not isolated. Considering his criminal behavior, the nature and seriousness \nof his misconduct, his falsifications of his interview(s)/sworn statement(s), and his \noverall conduct as established by the government, I find his favorable information is not \nsufficient to mitigate the Guideline J security concerns. His behavior raises questions \nabout his ability and willingness to follow the law, and ultimately, to protect classified \ninformation. His recent falsifications and lack of candor weigh against a finding of \nrehabilitation and positive behavioral changes. Accordingly, No Mitigating Conditions \nunder this concern are applicable supra. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \n \n8 It is a criminal offense to knowingly make any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement \nor representation, or knowingly make or use a false writing in any matter within the jurisdiction of the \nexecutive branch of the Government of the United States. Security clearances are within the jurisdiction \nof the executive branch of the Government of the United States. Egan, 484 U.S. at 527 (discussing 18 \nUSC \u00a7 1001). \n \n9ISCR Case  No. 04-09959 at 3 (App. Bd. May 19, 2006). \n\n \n16 \n \n \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 E2.2.1.: \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of \nparticipation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2.2.3., the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense determination based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I note that except for being \ninvoluntarily terminated on March 21, 2001, Applicant has enjoyed a very successful \nprofessional life. He and his wife raised two children, who are successful and productive \nmembers of society. When Applicant\u2019s termination is contrasted with his other lifetime \naccomplishments, it is relatively small by comparison. His difficulties at university are \nnot ongoing and are isolated. Accordingly, under the \u201cWhole Person Concept,\u201d SOR \u00b6 \n2.a. is deemed mitigated. \n \nUnfortunately, Applicant\u2019s deletions of proprietary information and subsequent \nfalsifications surrounding those deletions are a different matter. The best indicator of \nfuture behavior is past behavior. Applicant\u2019s conduct as it pertains to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a., 2.c. \nthrough 2.e., and 3.a. raises lingering security concerns. His subsequent denials of \nwrongdoing at his hearing suggest to me that he is unwilling to accept responsibility for \nhis actions and/or was attempting to divert his accountability or was simply not being \ntruthful.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant had not mitigated the security concerns arising from his Misuse of Information \nTechnology Systems, Personal Conduct, and Criminal Conduct considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline M:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b.:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n\n \n17 \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a.:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b.:  \n \nWithdrawn \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.c.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.d.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.e.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.f.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline J:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.a.  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Edmunds, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On November 25, 2005, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant\nof the basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct), and\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) pursuant to Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992,\n\nThe Judge\u2019s favorable findings with regard to Guideline J were not challenged on appeal.\n1\n2\nas amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On November 17, 2006, Administrative\nJudge Philip S. Howe granted Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Department Counsel\ntimely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.  \nDepartment Counsel raised the following issues on appeal:  whether the Administrative\nJudge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant did not intentionally falsify his answers to two questions on a\nsecurity clearance application and did not intentionally provide false information on a written\nstatement is supported by the record evidence and whether the Judge failed to address Applicant\u2019s\ncriminal charge of knowingly making false statements under Guideline E.   We reverse the\n1\nAdministrative Judge\u2019s decision to grant the clearance. \nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Factual Findings\nA. Facts \nThe Judge made the following factual findings: (a) Applicant was arrested in 1995 for second\ndegree rape (no force), a felony; (b) the female involved, who was underage, later explained what\nhappened and that the sex was consensual, and the charges against Applicant were eventually\ndismissed; (c) in August 2002, Applicant\u2019s attorney filed a motion to expunge this record;  (d)\nApplicant assumed the charges were no longer on his record because they were dismissed and he had\npetitioned the local court to expunge his record; (e) Applicant was arrested in 1997 on charges of\nsecond degree robbery, a felony; (f) Applicant was in the vicinity of some of his friends who attacked\na man and robbed him; (g) Applicant got into his car and left the scene when someone yelled the\npolice were coming; (h) Applicant was questioned by the police that night because he was\nrecognized by the victim as being in the vicinity; (i) Applicant was arrested two months later and\nplaced in jail: (j) while in jail, he was recognized by the robbery victim, who was there on other\ncharges; (k) the victim then told the authorities that Applicant was a witness and not a perpetrator;\n(l) Applicant was later released and the charges were dismissed on the motion of the prosecutor; (m)\nApplicant filed a motion to expunge this arrest record on an unknown date; (n) In April 2003,\nApplicant was served with a warrant charging him with making false statements about his income\non an application to obtain unemployment insurance; (o) Applicant had found an interim part-time\njob during a period where he was collecting unemployment benefits but he did not inform the\nunemployment insurance office, which would have reduced his unemployment benefits had it\nknown; (p) in June 2003, Applicant pled guilty to a reduced charge of theft by deception; (q)\nApplicant received a suspended jail sentence, was ordered to pay costs and restitution, and was\nplaced on probation; (r) Applicant thought the charges would be expunged when he completed the\nprobation in 2005; (s) Applicant received an income tax refund from the IRS in 2002: (t) he spent\nthe money, only to receive a letter from the IRS six months later asking for its return because he\nowed back child support; (u) on January 5, 2004, Applicant gave a written statement to a government\ninvestigator about the IRS check and states he was charged with theft by deception because he could\nnot repay the money; (v) Applicant\u2019s statement mentions a $300.00 per month repayment agreement\nthat, in fact, existed for the unemployment restitution, not the IRS repayment; (w) Applicant never\nwent to court for the IRS claim for repayment; (x) while he was with the government investigator,\nApplicant did not mention the unemployment insurance payments he received and did not relate\nthose payments to the theft by deception charges, claiming he was confused about the two situations;\n\n3\n(y) Applicant completed a security clearance application on September 5, 2003; (z) on it, he\ndisclosed his theft by deception arrest in 2003 in answer to Question 26 (any arrest, charges, or\nconvictions not listed elsewhere on the SCA); (aa) Question 21 of the SCA asked if Applicant had\never been charged with or convicted of any felony offenses; (bb) Applicant answered \u201cno\u201d because\nthe 1995 and 1997 charges were dismissed and he was never convicted; (cc) Applicant claims he\ndoes not know the difference between charges and convictions and he thought Question 21 meant\nin the conjunctive (\u201cand\u2019) and not the disjunctive (\u201cor\u201d) and referred to convictions of those offenses;\nand (dd) Applicant knew that he had not been convicted of the 1995 and 1997 charges.  \n  \nB. Discussion\nThe Appeal Board\u2019s review of the Administrative Judge\u2019s findings of fact is limited to\ndetermining if they are supported by substantial record evidence\u2014such relevant evidence as a\nreasonable mind might accept as adequate to support such a conclusion in light of all the contrary\nevidence in the record.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the\nevidence, and the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not\nprevent an administrative agency\u2019s finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d  Consolo\nv. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620-21 (1966).  In evaluating the Administrative\nJudge\u2019s findings, we are required to give deference to the Administrative Judge\u2019s credibility\ndeterminations.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1. \nThe Administrative Judge\u2019s resolution of the issue of whether Applicant engaged in\ndeliberate falsification, although it could easily be analyzed as a finding of fact, is couched in terms\nof the Judge\u2019s conclusions.  No other findings of fact are challenged on appeal.  Therefore, the\nappeal issue in this case can be resolved with reference to the Judge\u2019s conclusions, which are\ndescribed in the following paragraph.\n  \nWhether the Record Supports the Administrative Judge\u2019s Ultimate Conclusions\nThe Judge reached the following conclusions regarding the alleged falsifications by\nApplicant: (i) based on the evidence, including testimony that is credible, there was no knowing and\nwillful falsification by Applicant of his SCA and the statement to the government investigator; (ii)\nit is obvious from Applicant\u2019s testimony at the hearing and from the contents of his written statement\nto the investigator that he was confused about the information sought by Question 21 of the SCA,\nand was further confused in his statement about his conviction in 2003 and the IRS repayment (i.e.\nhe was confused about what offense he was convicted of in 2003); (iii) he misread Question 21 so\nhe thought he would be disclosing and admitting he was convicted of the felonies in 1995 and 1997\nwhen those were not the actual facts; (iv) Applicant\u2019s explanation and even his current display of\nconfusion on this issue is convincing and credible; (v) with that obvious confusion and lack of\nunderstanding of Question 21's meaning, he could not have knowingly and willfully made a false\nstatement; and (vi) Applicant\u2019s lack of sophistication is taken into account in deciding he was not\nacting or lying about the reasons he gave for failing to make the fullest disclosure.\n   \nAn Administrative Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a\nsatisfactory explanation for\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found\nand the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins.\n\n4\nCo., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983) (quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156,\n168 (1962)).  The Appeal Board may reverse the Administrative Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or\nrevoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.3.\nOur scope of review under this standard is narrow and we may not substitute our judgment for that\nof the Administrative Judge.  We may not set aside an Administrative Judge\u2019s decision \u201cthat is\nrational, based on consideration of the relevant factors, and within the scope of the authority\ndelegated to the agency. . .\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n, 463 U.S. at 42.  We review matters of law\nde novo.\nOn appeal, Department Counsel asserts that the Administrative Judge\u2019s conclusion that\nApplicant did not falsify his September 5, 2003 security clearance application and his conclusion that\nApplicant did not falsify his January 5, 2004 statement to a government investigator are arbitrary,\ncapricious and contrary to law.  Department Counsel\u2019s argument has merit.  \nMore specifically, Department Counsel contends: (a) the Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant\ndid not engage in deliberate falsification is based, in part, on a favorable credibility determination\nthat is not sustainable; (b) the Judge\u2019s decision does not articulate a satisfactory explanation for its\nconclusions that Applicant did not falsify; and (c) the Judge\u2019s ultimate favorable conclusion is not\nsustainable in light of the evidence to the contrary.  These arguments are persuasive.  \nIt is well established in industrial security clearance cases that the question of whether there\nis sufficient evidence to support a Judge\u2019s factual findings is a matter of law, not one of fact. See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 94-0964 at 3 (App. Bd. July 3, 1996).  The deference afforded a trier of fact is\nnot absolute. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 95-0178 at 2-4 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 1996).  Moreover,\nalthough the Board must give deference to the credibility determinations made by an Administrative\nJudge (Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1), that deference does not immunize credibility determinations from\nreview. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 99-0710 at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 19, 2001).  As the Supreme Court\nnoted in Anderson v. City of Bessemer, 470 U.S. 564, 575 (1985): \u201c[T]he trial judge may [not]\ninsulate his findings from review by denominating them credibility determinations, for factors other\nthan demeanor and inflection go into the decision whether or not to believe a witness.  Documents\nor objective evidence may contradict the witness\u2019 story; or the story itself may be so internally\ninconsistent or implausible on its face that a reasonable fact finder would not credit it.  Where such\nfactors are present, the courts of appeals may well find clear error even in a finding purportedly\nbased on a credibility determination.\u201d\nDepartment Counsel persuasively argues that the Judge accepted the Applicant\u2019s hearing\ntestimony concerning the issue of falsification uncritically.  The Judge\u2019s decision is lacking in any\nkind of in-depth analysis of Applicant\u2019s representations concerning his state of mind at the time he\nresponded to the government\u2019s inquiries, or whether those explanations are plausible in light of the\ntotality of the record evidence.  The decision contains little more than the rote adoption of\nApplicant\u2019s explanations coupled with the Judge\u2019s pronouncement that Applicant is credible.\nAn Administrative Judge is not required to accept testimony merely because it is unrebutted.\nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 99-0005 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 19, 2000).  Indeed, it would be arbitrary and\ncapricious for a Judge to uncritically accept a witness\u2019s testimony without considering whether it is\nplausible and consistent with other record evidence.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 00-0620 at 3 (App.\nBd. Oct. 19, 2001).  Accordingly, whether to accept an applicant\u2019s explanation about a matter cannot\nsimply turn on a Judge\u2019s assessment of the Applicant\u2019s demeanor when the applicant testifies.\n\nApplicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, wherein he is explaining his \u201cno\u201d answer to Question 21 of the security\n2\nclearance application, reads in part: \u201cThe answer to that question is yes and no yes I was charged and no I was not\nconvicted.\u201d\n5\nFurthermore, a Judge\u2019s acceptance of an applicant\u2019s explanation for his or her conduct must be based\non a reasonable interpretation of the record evidence as a whole.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 99-0710\nat 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 19, 2001); ISCR Case No. 99-0194 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 29, 2000).  In\ndetermining whether there is sufficient record evidence to support a Judge\u2019s findings, the Board will\nconsider not just whether there is record evidence consistent with the Judge\u2019s findings, but will also\nconsider whether there is evidence that detracts from the Judge\u2019s findings.  See Directive, Additional\nProcedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.1.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 99-0205 at 2 (Oct. 19, 2000).\nThere is record evidence in this case that strongly undercuts both the Judge\u2019s favorable\ncredibility determination of Applicant and the Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant responded to the\ngovernment\u2019s inquiries the way he did because of confusion and a lack of sophistication.  These\ncomponents of the case will be discussed in turn.\nThe Judge\u2019s favorable credibility determination is fundamentally flawed inasmuch as it\nignores an important aspect of the case.  It is undisputed that Applicant was convicted in 2003 on\na charge of theft by deception stemming from his making false statements to obtain unemployment\ninsurance benefits to which he was not entitled.  The Judge made no finding of fact that Applicant\nsuffered from any lack of understanding when he engaged in this attempt to defraud government\nauthorities.  The relevance of such a prior conviction to a subsequent determination of Applicant\u2019s\ncredibility is obvious.  However, the Judge does not include any discussion of this conviction in the\ncontext of determining Applicant\u2019s credibility.  Inasmuch as the 2003 conviction is powerful\nevidence that reflects on whether Applicant has a history of honesty and trustworthiness, the Judge\u2019s\nfailure to address it in the context of assessing Applicant\u2019s credibility was clear error.\nMoreover, Applicant\u2019s denials of an intent to falsify do not stand up well to close scrutiny.\nThe Judge accepted without comment Applicant\u2019s claim that, regarding the 1995 and 1997 incidents,\nhe did not understand the difference between a charge and a conviction for purposes of answering\nQuestion 21 of his security clearance application.  However, Applicant\u2019s hearing testimony belies\nthis explanation.  He knew the charges against him once existed and he knew he had never been\nconvicted of the offenses. Thus, logically, he would have to recognize the difference between the\ntwo.  Additionally, Applicant seemed to understand the distinction between \u201ccharges\u201d and\n\u201cconvictions\u201d in his answer to the SOR.   Thus, there is significant record evidence that detracts from\n2\nthe Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant did not understand the distinction between the two terms.  \nThe Judge also accepted without comment Applicant\u2019s explanation that he misread Question\n21 and thought it referred to whether he had ever \u201cbeen charged with and convicted of\u201d any felony\noffense, as opposed to the actual language of the question which asked whether he had ever \u201cbeen\ncharged with or convicted of\u201d any felony offense.  Question 21 contains plain language and clearly\ncontemplated the recording of felony charges, regardless of future disposition.  By focusing only on\nApplicant\u2019s claim that he had misunderstood what is objectively an unambiguous question, the Judge\nfailed to provide a rational explanation as to why Applicant had no intent to falsify when he\nanswered the question incorrectly.  Moreover, Applicant\u2019s claim that he misread Question 21 is\ninconsistent with his claim that he does not know the difference between charges and convictions.\nA review of the decision below indicates that the Judge accepted both of Applicant\u2019s explanations.\n\nApplicant\u2019s explanations regarding the omissions on his security clearance application were not evaluated by\n3\nthe Judge with reference to Applicant\u2019s explanation for the incorrect information in his statement to the government\ninvestigator, and vice versa.  In addition, neither of these matters were evaluated with reference to Applicant\u2019s 2003\nconviction for a crime involving dishonesty.  \n6\nNo deference is owed to a favorable credibility determination that results in acceptance of an\napplicant\u2019s explanations that are inconsistent and incompatible.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 00-0713at\n3 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2002).  The Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant did not falsify the security\nclearance application is unsustainable because it does not reflect a reasonable interpretation of the\nrecord evidence as a whole, including evidence that runs contrary to the Judge\u2019s finding. See\nDirective, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.1.\nRegarding Applicant\u2019s January 5, 2004 sworn statement, in which he erroneously attributed\nhis 2003 criminal conviction of theft by deception to his failure to make payments on an IRS tax\nrefund dispute, Department Counsel persuasively argues that Applicant\u2019s claim of confusion between\nthe IRS matter and his conviction for fraudulently attempting to obtain unemployment compensation\nbenefits is not reasonably supported by the record evidence.  The undisputed record evidence\nindicates that: (a) Applicant received a uniform citation that clearly detailed the charge as knowingly\nmaking false statements for unemployment benefits; (b) the charge initiated in state court; (c)\nApplicant was sentenced in state court to two years probation until mid-2005, was ordered not to\nmove out of state, and was required to pay the state $1,045 in restitution; (d) Applicant was still on\nprobation for his state conviction at the time he executed his statement; (e) Applicant gave his\nsigned, sworn statement only six months after he pled guilty to theft by deception: and (f) Applicant\ntestified at the hearing that, prior to executing his security clearance application and prior to\nproviding the 2005 statement to the government, he knew that the theft by deception conviction was\nfor fraudulently receiving unemployment benefits.  This evidence, along with the commonsense\nnotion that a state court conviction is not something that can be readily confused with a federal tax\nmatter not in litigation runs contrary to the Judge\u2019s conclusions concerning Applicant\u2019s state of mind\nwhen he executed the statement.                       \n \nIn summary, the Judge failed to consider or analyze record evidence that detracted from his\nconclusions about Applicant\u2019s state of mind, he substituted a favorable credibility determination for\nrecord evidence, and he engaged in a piecemeal analysis of Applicant\u2019s responses to the\ngovernment.   The Board concludes that the Judge\u2019s decision is not based on the record evidence as\n3\na whole or on a reasonable evaluation of Applicant\u2019s explanations regarding his responses to the\ngovernment. \nDepartment Counsel raises a separate appeal issue concerning the Judge\u2019s failure to analyze\nApplicant\u2019s 2003 conviction for theft by deception under Guideline E.

Crowley, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant has a history of indebtedness, which he addressed by securing a higher paying job\n\nG overnment Exhibit (G E) 1(Standard Form (SF) 86, Security Clearance Application)\n1\nw as signed by Applicant on September 24, 2003.\nO n Aug. 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a\n2\nmemorandum directing application of revised Adjudicative Guideline to all adjudications and\nother determinations made under the D irective and Department of Defense (D oD ) Regulation\n5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program  (Regulation), dated Jan. 1987, as amended, in which the\nSO R was issued on or after Sep. 1, 2006. The revised Adjudicative Guidelines are applicable to\nA pplicant\u2019s case.\n2\nas well as a part-time job. He also sought financial counseling and has embraced the notion of\nremaining financially solvent. Applicant presented sufficient information to explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate the security concern. Clearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn September 24, 2003, Applicant submitted a Security Clearance Application (SF 86).  On\n1\nMarch 6, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons\n(SOR) to him, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within\nIndustry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive\n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated\nJanuary 2, 1992, as amended, modified and revised.  \n2\nThe SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The SOR\ndetailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive\nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for him,\nand recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be\ngranted, continued, denied, or revoked.\nIn an answer dated and notarized on April 7, 2007, Applicant responded to the SOR\nallegations and requested a hearing. The case was assigned to me on May 22, 2007. On June 7, 2007,\nDOHA issued a notice of hearing scheduling the case to be heard on July 11, 2007.  The hearing was\nheld as scheduled. On July 20, 2007, DOHA received the transcript (Tr.). I left the record open until\nJuly 20, 2007 to afford the Applicant an opportunity to submit additional material. Tr. 74-79, 91.\nHe timely submitted additional material, which was marked and appended to the record.\nFINDINGS OF FACT \nIn his reply to the SOR, Applicant admitted all indebtedness. His admissions are incorporated\nherein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make\nthe following findings of fact.  \n\nG E 1, supra n. 1.is the basis for the facts in this paragraph, unless otherw ise stated. \n3\n3\nApplicant is 41 years old.  He graduated from high school in June 1984. Tr. 62. He attended\n3\ncommunity college from August 1984 to May 1986, and was a awarded an associate of arts degree\nin computer science. He served in the U.S. Army from November 1986 to August 1997, and was\nhonorably discharged. Tr. 65. He was previously married from October 1989 to September 1998.\nThat marriage ended by divorce. He has two sons from his first marriage, ages 16 and 12. He pays\n$892 per month in child support plus their health care insurance premiums. He remarried in\nSeptember 2005 and he has a one-year-old daughter from his current marriage. Tr. 22-23. He has\nbeen employed by a defense contractor as a senior applications engineer since August 2006. Tr. 45.\nHe has also taken on a part-time job as a security guard.\nApplicant has successfully held a security clearance that was initially granted shortly after\nenlisting in the Army. Tr. 16. He is seeking to retain a security clearance for his current employment.\nApplicant has a history of financial problems. The SOR lists 17 unpaid debts ranging from\n$34 to $18,760, exceeding $40,000. Two of the largest debts are for automobile loans in which\nApplicant fell behind during his separation and divorce from his first wife. Of those 17 debts,\nApplicant has paid off four debts, made payment arrangements on 8 debts, and attempting settlement\nof five debts. Two debts listed in the SOR are duplicates.\nApplicant attributes the debts to bad management by him and his ex-wife, the break-up of\na relationship with a girlfriend after his divorce, expenses associated with his mother passing away\nin 2004, and costs of moving after his divorce, and break-up with his then girlfriend. One of the\nlarger debts was for loan he co-signed for an automobile his ex-wife kept. The automobile was\nrepossessed after she failed to make payments and Applicant was held responsible for the debt. After\nhe remarried, his second wife had a difficult pregnancy that lead to additional unplanned expenses.\nTo overcome his indebtedness, he sought and secured a better paying job and has taken on\na part-time job. His post-hearing materials show an earnest effort to document good-faith attempts\nto achieve financial stability. He recognizes the importance of overcoming his indebtedness and the\nadverse impact non-payment of debts may have on his clearance. He is also enrolled in and is\nreceiving financial counseling. His budget reflects a net remainder of $654 per month.  Tr. 57. With\nhis higher paying job and part-time job, Applicant is able to support his family and address his past\ndue debts. His most recent work performance evaluation indicates above average performance.\nPOLICIES\nIn an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s security suitability, an administrative judge must consider\nthe \u201cAdjudicative Guideline for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified Information\u201d\n(Guideline[s]), which sets forth adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief introductory\nexplanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines are divided into Disqualifying\nConditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC), which are used to determine an applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.\n\n \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept\n4\nas adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISC R\nCase No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing D irective \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cThis is\nsomething less than the w eight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing tw o inconsistent\nconclusions from the evidence does not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by\nsubstantial evidence.\u201d Consolo v. Federal M aritim e C om m \u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966).\n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v.\nW ashington M etro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4  Cir. 1994).\nth\n \u201cThe Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence as a w hole, both favorable\n5\nand unfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent\nprovisions of the Directive, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion\nunder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d ISC R Case N o. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006). \n4\nThese Guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, an administrative judge should apply these guidelines in\nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. Guideline \u00b6 2. An administrative\njudge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. Because the\nentire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person\nconcept,\u201d an administrative judge should consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nSpecifically, an administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors\nlisted at Guideline \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency\nand recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5)\nextent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nSince the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision\nin each case is arrived at by applying the standard that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being\nconsidered for access to classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d\nGuideline \u00b6 2(b). In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable,\nlogical and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing\ninferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nIn the decision-making process, the Government has the initial burden of establishing\ncontroverted facts by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d  demonstrating, in accordance with the Directive, that\n4\nit is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to\nclassified information. Once the Government has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying\ncondition, the burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] has the\nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\nThe burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No.\n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).5\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with\nthe government predicated upon trust and confidence. It is a relationship that transcends normal duty\nhours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is because of this special relationship the\ngovernment must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to\n\nRevised Guidelines at 13-14 (setting forth the disqualifying and mitigating conditions).\n6\nDC 19(a) is \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.\u201d\n7\nDC 19(c) is \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d\n8\nMC 20(d) \u201cis the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve\n9\ndebts.\u201d\nMC 20(b) \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the persons control\n10\n(e.g. . . . unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly\nunder the circumstances.\u201d\n5\nwhom it grants access to classified information. Decisions under this Directive include, by necessity,\nconsideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible\nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nThe scope of an administrative judge\u2019s decision is limited. Nothing in this Decision should\nbe construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied\ndetermination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.  Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7. \nCONCLUSIONS\nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate legal\nprecepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly above, I conclude the following\nwith respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR:\nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations,  a security concern typically exists due to\n6\nsignificant unpaid debts.  Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by\nrules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal or unethical acts to general funds to meet\nfinancial obligations. Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be\nirresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and safeguarding classified\ninformation.\nThe record evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial problems.\nHis history of financial problems is a security concern because it indicates inability or unwillingness\nto satisfy debts  and a history of not meeting financial obligations  within the meaning of Guideline\n7\n8\nF.  The record is more than sufficient to establish these two disqualifying conditions.\nApplicant received credit in mitigation.  The most pertinent mitigating condition is the fourth\nMC  of Guideline F, because Applicant has made a good-faith effort to repay or settle the 17 debts\n9\nlisted in the SOR. His good-faith effort is established by his actions. He sought out and secured a\nbetter paying job and took on additional part-time job. He also receives credit in mitigation under the\nsecond MC  as a result of his wife\u2019s difficult pregnancy, his mother\u2019s death, and his separation and\n10\n\nMC 20(c) \u201cthe person has received counseling or is receiving counseling for the problem and /or there are\n11\nclear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.\u201d\nSee ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd. June 28, 2006). \n12\n6\ndivorce from his first wife. Lastly, Applicant receives credit under the third MC for getting to the\nsource of his problem and that is understanding how he got into financial trouble and learning how\nto manage his finances by taking a financial counseling course.11\nAnd unlike many applicants in financial cases, Applicant verified his actions by providing\nsubstantial documentary proof of payment or settlement of his debts.  Applicant has addressed his\nfinancial problems, has cash left over, and is otherwise living within his means. Although he can be\nfaulted for taking too long to address his indebtedness, he has since taken action to minimize and\novercome concerns about his financial situation. His history of successfully maintaining a security\nclearance without incident stemming back to his Army service and his positive employment record\nweigh heavily in his favor in assessing his security eligibility under the \u201cwhole person\u201d analysis.\nBased on the record evidence as a whole, Applicant presented sufficient evidence to explain,\nextenuate, or mitigate the financial considerations security concern.  Likewise, he has met his\nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.\nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d  and supporting evidence, my\n12\napplication of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative Process, and my interpretation of my\nresponsibilities under the Guideline. Applicant has mitigated and overcome the government\u2019s case.\nFor the reasons stated, I conclude he is eligible for access to classified information.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nSOR \u00b6 1 - Guideline F:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs a - q:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or\ncontinue a security clearance for Applicant. Clearance is granted.\nRobert J. Tuider\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Norman, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On October 21, 2005, DOHA issued a statement of reasons advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department\nof Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan.2, 1992, as amended)(Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.\nOn August 9, 2006, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Michael H. Leonard denied Applicant\u2019s\n\n2\nrequest for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and\nE3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge erred in finding that\nApplicant was fired by a previous employer for violating company policy by conducting an affair\nwith, and showing favoritism toward, a subordinate employee.  Applicant\u2019s brief also contains\nmatters which we construe as alleging that the Judge\u2019s unfavorable clearance decision was arbitrary,\ncapricious, and contrary to law.  In support of his appeal, Applicant submits an additional piece of\nevidence not offered at the hearing, in the form of an affidavit.  We affirm the decision of the Judge.\nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Factual Findings\nA.  Facts\nThe Judge made the following findings that are pertinent to this appeal: Applicant is a 47 year\nold senior network engineer employed by a Defense Department contractor.  In April 1997 Applicant\nbegan working for a previous employer, becoming a senior network engineer.\nApplicant\u2019s relationship with a female subordinate came to the attention of his previous\nemployer\u2019s management.  The Vice President of the company presented credible evidence at the\nhearing that Applicant showed the subordinate disparately favorable treatment; that he conducted\nan extramarital affair with her; and that he misused company resources by submitting petty cash\nreceipts and travel receipts for expenses incurred in carrying on the affair.  Because of this activity,\nApplicant\u2019s previous employer fired him.\nB.  Discussion\nThe Appeal Board\u2019s review of the Judge\u2019s findings of facts is limited to determining if they\nare supported by substantial evidence\u2013such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as\nadequate to support such a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  Directive\n\u00b6  E3.1.32.1.  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing\ntwo inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency\u2019s findings\nfrom being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S.\n607, 620-21 (1966).  In evaluating the Judge\u2019s findings, we are required to give deference to the\nJudge\u2019s credibility determinations.  Directive  \u00b6  E3.1.32.1.  \nWe have examined the challenged findings in light of the record as a whole and conclude that\nthey are supported by substantial evidence.  Therefore, we conclude that there is no error with respect\nto the Judge\u2019s material findings of security concern.\nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Ultimate Conclusions\n   A Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation\nfor\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choices made.\u2019\u201d\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43\n(1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. V. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  \u201cThe\ngeneral standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests\n\n3\nof national security.\u2019\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 581, 528 (1988). The Appeal\nBoard may reverse the Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or revoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Directive  \u00b6  E3.1.32.3.  We review matters of law de novo.\nWe have examined the Judge\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions in light of the security\nconcerns addressed under Guideline E\u2013that conduct reflecting \u201cunreliability\u201d or an \u201cunwillingness\nto comply with rules and regulations\u201d indicates that a person may not properly safeguard classified\ninformation.  See Directive  \u00b6  E2.A5.1.1.  Applicant contends that the Judge\u2019s favorable findings\non other allegations contained in the SOR are inconsistent with those at issue on appeal.  However,\nwe have examined these findings and conclude that they are logically separable from those which\nunderlie the Judge\u2019s ultimate decision.  We conclude that there is a rational connection between the\nJudge\u2019s adverse findings and his decision to deny Applicant a clearance.  Therefore, we hold that the\nJudge\u2019s decision is not arbitrary, capricious, nor contrary to law.  We cannot consider the new\nevidence which Applicant has submitted in support of his appeal.  Directive  \u00b6  E3.1.29.\n\n4\nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s decision denying Applicant a clearance is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Jeffrey D. Billett               \nJeffrey D.

Financial Considerations and Personal\nConduct concerns are not mitigated where delinquent debts are unresolved and he continues to\ngamble. Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for Applicant. As required by Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 \u00b6 E3.1.2\n(Jan. 2, 1992), as amended, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on September 28, 2005,\ndetailing the basis for its decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the Directive. Applicant answered the SOR\non October 25, 2000, and requested a decision based on the written record.\nOn March 16, 2006, Applicant requested a hearing, and the case was assigned to me on April\n10, 2006. Pursuant to notice dated June 12, 2006, a hearing was convened on June 27, 2006, to\nconsider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security\nclearance for Applicant. Seven government exhibits (Ex. 1-7) were admitted and Applicant testified,\nas reflected in a transcript (Tr.) received July 17, 2006.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nDOHA alleged under Guideline F ( Financial Considerations) that Applicant owes charged\noff credit card debt totaling $4,420 (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c), an unpaid judgment debt of $2,406 (\u00b61.d),\npersonal loans from friends totaling $13,000 (\u00b6 1.e), and personal loans from relatives totaling\n$34,000 (\u00b6 1.f); that he petitioned for Chapter 13 bankruptcy in February 2001 because of gambling\nactivities (\u00b6 1.g); that he falsified a travel voucher in August or September 1988 to pay a bookie and\nwas forced to resign from his job as a result (\u00b6 1.h); that he incurred about $120,000 in gambling\nlosses between 1984 and 1987 (\u00b6 1.i); and that he gambled from 1969 to at least June 2004, including\nafter he filed for bankruptcy (\u00b6 1.j). The alleged falsification of the travel voucher, gambling losses,\nand gambling activities from 1969 to at least June 2004, were also cross-alleged under Guideline E,\nPersonal Conduct (\u00b6 2.a).\nApplicant admitted he had been indebted as alleged, but indicated the judgment debt had\nbeen paid through the bankruptcy, he had arranged to repay his consumer credit debt, and he and his\nfriends and relatives had mutually agreed on when he would repay the funds he borrowed from them.\nApplicant also acknowledged he had lost some $120,000 gambling between 1984 and 1987, had\nfalsified the travel voucher, and had continued to gamble after his bankruptcy filing. He denied that\nhis conduct raised Personal Conduct concerns, and cited as evidence of his trustworthiness his part-\ntime employment as a security guard for the state bureau of investigation for the past three years.\n\n3\nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the indebtedness and gambling activities are incorporated as\nfindings of fact. After a thorough review and consideration of the evidence of record, I make the\nfollowing additional findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 59-year-old senior project technical analyst/specialist in a defense contractor\u2019s\nlife cycle support department. Applicant worked for the company from April 1974, with a secret\nclearance, from 1975 until about October 1988, when he was forced to resign after falsifying a travel\nvoucher to obtain a cash advance for gambling. He was rehired about 15 months later. On April 26,\n1991, he was granted a secret clearance which he now seeks to retain.\nApplicant attended college from September 1965 to May 1971. He began gambling while in\ncollege, betting between $30 and $40 at racetracks twice monthly. After he earned his bachelor of\nscience degree, he served in the U.S. Army National Guard until 1977, including for three years after\nhe started working for his current employer.\nHis gambling increased over the years to where, by 1984, it was almost daily. From 1984 to\n1987, he placed bets on baseball games with bookies, gambling about $300 per occasion. His salary\nof about $32,000 annually was not sufficient to support his gambling activities during this period,\nand he began to take cash advances from credit cards. He continued to gamble despite heavy losses,\nwhich totaled about $120,000 between 1984 and 1987. For about 12 months starting in 1987, he paid\na bookie $400 per week in interest on funds borrowed to gamble.\nNeeding money to pay a gambling debt, Applicant in August or September 1988 submitted\na travel voucher at work claiming a cash advance of $950 for a trip he did not intend to take. He\nforged his director\u2019s signature on the voucher. After he got the funds, he told his supervisor what he\nhad done and was given the option of resigning in lieu of being fired. When he left the employ of\nthe defense contractor in October 1988, he received $25,000 from his stock savings plan that he used\nto repay his creditors. He also borrowed $75,000 to $80,000 from his father, to repay his debts,\nwhich included cash advances in excess of $29,000 and bank loans taken out to gamble. Most of his\ndebts were paid in full or settled in February 1989. Applicant made payments of $80 per month on\n$7,000 in loans owed to a bank.\nIn January 1989, Applicant began outpatient counseling with a therapist for this gambling.\nHe attended ten sessions and one session of Gamblers Anonymous. Employed by a moving company\nat that time, Applicant limited his gambling to off-track betting once in awhile.\nOn October 3, 1990, Applicant was interviewed by a special agent of the Defense Security\nService (DSS) about his gambling and related financial difficulties as well as his termination from\nhis defense contractor employment in 1988. Applicant detailed his gambling activities but indicated\nthat most of his debts had been paid with stock savings and loans from family members. He denied\nany gambling since 1987 and any intent of gambling in the future. Applicant estimated a net monthly\nremainder of $290 which he indicated was sufficient to meet his expenses in a timely manner.\nApplicant resumed gambling in about 1991, shortly after he was rehired by his current\nemployer. He played blackjack at a casino that had recently opened in his area and engaged in some\noff-track betting. With college costs for his children and his gambling, Applicant again began to fall\nbehind in his obligations. In 1999 or 2000, when his annual income was in excess of $41,000,\n\n4\nApplicant borrowed $9,000 from one friend and $4,000 from another to cover his expenses. He also\nborrowed $29,000 from his sister, and $5,000 from his brother, which went to pay off a bank loan.\nIn September 2000, Applicant and his spouse divorced after 29 years of marriage, in part because\nof his continued gambling. He went to the casino if he had a few dollars to bet, and bet more if he\nwon money. There was no set limit to his gambling. Applicant did not pay his lawyer for services\nrendered, and the attorney obtained a judgment against him in the amount of $2,406 on November\n16, 2000.\nAbout $50,000 in debt because of gambling, and  in arrears on his mortgage, Applicant filed\na Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition on February 15, 2001. He listed unsecured priority claims of $8,525\n(unpaid federal and state income taxes and municipal real estate and use taxes) and nonpriority\nclaims of $8,975 (a $1,500 fuel oil debt, $750 for legal services owed to his ex-wife\u2019s attorney,\n$1,500 in property settlement to his ex-wife, $2,400 to his divorce lawyer, $1,225 in revolving credit\ncard debt, and a $1,600 deficiency balance following a vehicle repossession). Applicant did not\nreport any gambling losses. On April 18, 2001, the bankruptcy court ordered $131 per week be\ndeducted from Applicant\u2019s pay for 260 weeks under the bankruptcy plan. In 2001 or 2002, Applicant\nbegan working a second job part-time as a security guard.\nIn July 2002, Applicant sold his home to the friend from whom he had borrowed the $9,000.\nApplicant stayed in the residence at a rent of $1,000 per month. On May 12, 2003, Applicant\nexecuted a security clearance application (SF 86), listing his bankruptcy.\nOn June 28, 2004, Applicant was interviewed by a contract investigator for the Defense\nSecurity Service. Applicant attributed his bankruptcy to his gambling, which he indicated started in\n1998. Applicant averred that $131 was still being deducted from his pay weekly under the\nbankruptcy plan, and he owed about $4,300 total on five MasterCard accounts, $250 on a personal\nloan with a credit union, and $15,000 in student loans for his son on which he was making $200\nmonthly payments. He related he was paying $100 to his daughter for $5,000 in cash advances  from\nher credit card taken on his behalf in about $2,000. Applicant also acknowledged he had borrowed\n$29,000 from his sister ($10,000 of which was paid to his spouse in their divorce), $5,000 from his\nbrother, $9,000 from his landlord/friend, and $4,000 from another friend, but that they were not\ndemanding repayment. He added he had \u201ccurtailed [his] gambling activity substantially\u201d since filing\nfor bankruptcy, and described his current gambling as once or twice per week at the casino,  with net\nbetting outlays of cash about $100 per visit. Applicant indicated he had about $162 remaining each\nmonth because of his second job and overtime with the defense contractor.\nA check of Applicant\u2019s credit on August 15, 2005, revealed that Applicant was past due $929\non a MasterCard account that had been charged off in about March 2004 (\u00b6 1.a). A second\nMasterCard account, charged off in about June 2004, was past due $1,676 (\u00b61.b). Yet a third\nMasterCard account had been charged off with $1,815 past due (\u00b6 1.c). His credit report did not\nreflect satisfaction of the judgment debt owed his bankruptcy lawyer (\u00b6 1.d), although he was paying\nit back through the bankruptcy.\nOn September 28, 2005, Applicant was placed on notice with the issuance of the SOR that\nhis gambling activities, his delinquent consumer credit debts, and unpaid personal loans were of\nconcern to the Department of Defense. He continued to frequent the casino about twice per week,\nagainst the advice of family members,  but did not gamble every time. In November 2005, Applicant\n\n5\ntook out a $18,879 automobile loan to be repaid at $393 per month. The next month, his overtime\nended at work. In December 2005, Applicant cashed checks totaling $500 at the casino. He spent\nabout $120 of the money gambling. He did not know that his overtime was about to end when he\nbought the car. In January 2006, he moved to lower his rent. In May 2006, he made his last payment\nof $131 under the bankruptcy.\nA check of Applicant\u2019s credit on June 20, 2006, revealed another MasterCard account had\nbeen charged off in April 2006, when it became past due with a $1,558 balance (not alleged), and\nthat Applicant also owed unpaid delinquent credit card balances of $904 (\u00b6 1.a), $1,626 (\u00b6 1.b), and\n$1,197 (\u00b6 1.c). A past due telephone debt of $92 had been placed for collection in October 2005. He\nhad been late on his automobile loan in early 2006, although the loan had since been brought current.\nSomething has always come up (car repairs, his son needed money) that has prevented him from\npaying on his delinquent consumer credit card debts.\nAs of late June 2006, Applicant owed his former landlord/friend $1,000 in back rent.  With\nlittle to no opportunity for overtime, his annual earnings at the defense contractor job were $45,000.\nHe continued to supplement his income by working as a part-time security officer, taking home\nabout $130 per week from that job. Living from paycheck to paycheck, Applicant had a negative\nbalance in his checking account (-$19) and $15 in savings. He feels no pressure to pay back his\nsiblings. He has made some payment of the loans extended to him by his friends. He owes $3,900\nof the original $4,000 and $8,300 of the $9,000 loan. When he turns 59 1/2, he plans to withdraw\nhis $20,000 in stock savings at work and pay off his friends. Applicant owes back federal taxes of\nabout $9,000 for 2003 and 2004, and $600 to $700 to the state. Applicant has continued to go to the\ncasino with varying frequency that averages out to twice per week. Especially during the summer\nwhen he coaches softball, he might not go for a couple of weeks. Other times, he will frequent the\ncasino three or four days in a row. He still loses \u201ca few dollars\u201d (Tr. 128), and has lost about $2,500\nin a year\u2019s time of late. Family members have advised him to stay away from the casino.  \nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527.\nThe President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants eligibility for\naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb.\n20, 1960). An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App.\nBd. Dec. 19, 2002).\nThe Adjudicative Guidelines set forth potentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and\nmitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline. In evaluating the security worthiness of an\napplicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6 6.3\nof the Directive. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant. See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. It is merely an indication\n\n6\nthe applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have\nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n\n7\nCONCLUSIONS\nGuideline F\u2014Financial Considerations\nUnder Guideline F, an individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to\nengage in illegal acts to generate funds.(\u00b6 E2.A6.1.1) Applicant has a history of financial problems\nsince the latter half of the 1980s, when he had to borrow $75,000 to $80,000 from his father and\nfalsified a travel voucher at work for a cash advance to pay off gambling debt. While he paid off\nmany of his debts in February 1989, he had to borrow $34,000 from his siblings and $13,000 from\nfriends in 1999/00 to cover subsequent obligations, including an installment loan with a bank. As\nof his February 2001 bankruptcy filing, he owed about $50,000 in gambling debt, was in arrears on\nhis mortgage, and had not paid his divorce attorney. Although he satisfied the mortgage arrearage\non the sale of his home, and paid $34,000 to his creditors in the bankruptcy, he fell delinquent on\nsome MasterCard accounts opened after he filed for bankruptcy (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a., 1.b, 1.c, and a fourth debt\nof $1,558 not alleged). He also owes delinquent taxes. He has not satisfied the personal loans\nborrowed from his friends and relatives. Several disqualifying conditions (DC) are implicated: \u00b6\nE2.A6.1.2.1. A history of not meeting financial obligations; \u00b6 E2. A6.1.2.2. Deceptive or illegal\nfinancial practice such as embezzlement, employee theft, check fraud, income tax evasion, expense\naccount fraud, filing deceptive loan statements, and other intentional financial breaches of trust; \u00b6\nE2.A6.1.2.3. Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts, and \u00b6 E2.A6.1.2.5. Financial problems that\nare linked to gambling, drug abuse, alcoholism, or other issues of security concern.\nMitigating condition (MC) \u00b6 E2.A6.1.3.6. The individual initiated a good-faith effort to\nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts, applies because of his Chapter 13 bankruptcy\nwith weekly payments under the wage earner plan. Favorable findings are returned as to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g\nand 1.d because of the satisfaction in bankruptcy.  Furthermore, the loss of available overtime since\nDecember 2005 is an unexpected circumstance that has recently negatively affected his finances.\nHowever, neither MC \u00b6 E2.A6.1.3.3. The conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control, nor MC \u00b6 E2.A6.1.3.6 adequately address the gambling, which caused\nmuch of his financial difficulty. While he received counseling in 1989 for his gambling, MC \u00b6\nE2.A6.1.3.4. requires, in addition to counseling, clear indication that the problem is being resolved\nor is under control. Although his gambling losses have not approached the $120,000 of the 1980s,\nhe continues to frequent casinos on average twice weekly. While he does not always gamble, he has\nincurred gambling losses of about $2,500 in a year\u2019s time of late. (Tr. 116) Whether Applicant\nspends $10 or \u201ca couple hundred\u201d gambling (Tr. 125), he shows poor financial judgment in not using\nthose funds to pay off his creditors. Future serious financial difficulties cannot be ruled out where\nhe intends to continue to gamble despite a history of gambling losses (\u201conce in a while I\u2019ve won, but,\nyou know, nothing, nothing major or that would, you know, help me pay off something.\u201d Tr. 125)\nand he lives from paycheck to paycheck.\nGuideline E\u2014Personal Conduct\nConduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate that the person may\nnot properly safeguard classified information. (\u00b6 E2.A5.1.1) Applicant exercised poor judgment\nwithin the context of Guideline E by gambling despite losses totaling more than three times his\nannual salary, and continuing to gamble after he filed for bankruptcy in February 2001. He exhibited\n\n8\ndishonesty by submitting in August or September 1988 a false travel claim to his employer to obtain\na cash advance of about $950 to repay a bookie. Under Guideline E, DC \u00b6 E2.A5.1.2.1. Reliable,\nunfavorable information provided by associates, employers, coworkers, neighbors, and other\nacquaintances, is potentially applicable to such adverse employment information, although it is not\nclear whether the DSS learned from Applicant\u2019s employer or only from Applicant that he had been\nforced to resign from his employment because of his fraudulent conduct.\nAlthough none of the Guideline E mitigating conditions are on point, Applicant is credited\nwith coming forward with his employer about the false voucher, albeit after he received the money.\nThere is no evidence of any recurrence of that misconduct, although it continues to raise judgment\nconcerns. Moreover, although it is legal to gamble in casinos, serious security concerns are raised\nwhen an individual is unable or unwilling to fulfill other obligations as a result. In this case,\nApplicant has demonstrated unreliability in his financial affairs because of his gambling. Serious\nconcerns persist about his judgment and reliability where he does not appreciate the risk presented\nby gambling beyond one\u2019s means:\nAnd, you know, I think if I was a person, I was kind a going astray, or whatever, I\u2019d\nbe missing a lotta time at work, which I don\u2019t do. I wouldn\u2019t be getting involved in\nour community, which I do all the time, and again, it\u2019s just something that happened,\nyou know, I\u2019m not happy about it. It\u2019s caused some hardships, but, you know, life\ngoes on, and I\u2019m making every effort to pay out all my debts, and again, the majority\nof them are credit cards, and you know, hopefully within\u2014my goal is to get them\npaid off in a couple of years, and then hopefully in another couple of years I\u2019m going\nto retire. . .\nAnd as far as\u2014again, you know, I\u2019m not really sure what the reason is that I would,\nyou know, be denied this, because I might be tempted to give someone some, you\nknow,  information that they shouldn\u2019t have. I mean, like I said, it never entered my\nmind. Never will enter my mind. You know, just I\u2019m not that type of a person. You\nknow, I gamble, and you know, a few things that are associated with gambling, you\nknow, lying here and there, and\u2014but I\u2019m trying to, you know, make good for, you\nknow, what I owe, and basically I mean that\u2019s it. (Tr. 32-33)\nWhole Person Analysis\n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.\u201d (\u00b6 E2.2.1)\nApplicant\u2019s extensive gambling as an adult (\u00b6 E2.2.1.4. The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time\nof the conduct), while legal, led to such financial pressure that he filed a false travel claim at work\nin 1988 to obtain funds to alleviate his gambling debt (\u00b6 E2.2.1.1. The nature, extent, and\nseriousness of the conduct). While there has been no recurrence of the fraudulent behavior since\n1988 (\u00b6 E2.2.1.6. The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes),\nApplicant has not shown similar reform with respect to his gambling. He intends to continue to\nfrequent a local casino, many times just for dinner but on occasion to gamble, despite the problems\nhis gambling has caused him, and family members\u2019 admonitions to stay away from the casino (\u00b6\nE2.2.1.9. The likelihood of continuation or recurrence). The potential for financial pressures is\n\n9\nsignificant (\u00b6 E2.2.1.8. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress) and not\novercome by his 30 years of employment with the defense contractor or by his contributions to the\ncommunity as a local coach.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.

Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On August 8, 2006, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Barry M. Sax\n\n2\ndenied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge erred by concluding that\nthe security concerns raised under Guideline F had not been mitigated.\nApplicant argues that the Judge\u2019s adverse decision should be reversed because the Judge did\nnot give sufficient weight to Applicant mitigating evidence which he contends demonstrates that his\nfinancial problems were due to circumstances beyond his control, and that he has now received\nfinancial counseling and established a repayment plan for his debts.  Applicant also argues that the\nJudge erred with respect to one of his findings and there are internal inconsistencies with respect to\nseveral others.  The Board does not find Applicant\u2019s arguments persuasive. \nWe have considered the challenged findings in light of the record and conclude that they are\nbased on substantial evidence.  To the extent that there is error in the Judge\u2019s findings we conclude\nthat it is harmless.  Applicant has not met his burden of demonstrating that the Judge\u2019s material\nfindings with respect to his conduct of security concern do not reflect a reasonable or plausible\ninterpretation of the record evidence.  Considering the record evidence as a whole, the Judge\u2019s\nmaterial findings of security concern are sustainable. \nLikewise, Applicant has not met his burden of demonstrating that the Judge erred in\nconcluding that the financial considerations allegations had not been mitigated.  Although Applicant\nstrongly disagrees with the Judge\u2019s conclusions, he has not established that those conclusions are\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.3.\nIn this case, the Judge made sustainable findings that Applicant had a lengthy history of not\nmeeting financial obligations, that Applicant had previously had indebtedness discharged in\nbankruptcy, and that Applicant had only established his current repayment plan subsequent to the\nhearing.   In light of the foregoing, the Judge could reasonably conclude that the security concerns\nraised by Applicant\u2019s financial problems had not been mitigated.  See, e.g.,  ISCR Case No. 04-\n09248 at 2 (App. Bd. Jan. 17, 2007); ISCR Case No. 03-13768 at 4 (App. Bd. June 16, 2005).  \nThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions does not turn simply on a finding\nthat one or more of them applies to the particular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires\nthe exercise of sound discretion in light of the record evidence as a whole.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No.\n01-14740 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan.15, 2003).  Thus, the presence of some mitigating evidence does not\nalone compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the\nJudge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs\nthe unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of\nthe evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to\ndemonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.\nThe Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the length and\nseriousness of the disqualifying conduct and considered the possible application of relevant\nmitigating conditions.  He articulated a rational basis for not applying any mitigating conditions in\n\n3\nthis case, and reasonably explained why the evidence which the Applicant had presented in\nmitigation was insufficient to overcome the government\u2019s security concerns.  The Board does not\nreview a case de novo.  The favorable record evidence cited by Applicant is not sufficient to\ndemonstrate the Administrative Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 02-28041 at 4 (App. Bd. June 29, 2005).  Given the record that was before him,\nthe Judge\u2019s ultimate unfavorable clearance decision under Guidelines F is sustainable.  Thus, the\nJudge did not err in denying Applicant a clearance.\nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge denying Applicant a clearance is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Jean E. Smallin     \nJean E.

Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S.\n607, 620-21 (1966).  In evaluating the Judge\u2019s findings, we are required to give deference to the\nJudge\u2019s credibility determinations.

Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43\n(1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. V. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  \u201cThe\ngeneral standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests\nof national security.\u2019\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). The Appeal\nBoard may reverse the Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or revoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Directive  \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.32.3 and E3.1.33.3.  \n\u201c[T]here is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance.\u201d   Dorfmont v. Brown,\n913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  Once the government\nth\npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to establish any\nappropriate mitigating conditions.  See Directive  \u00b6  E3.1.15.  \u201cThe application of disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions and whole person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more\nof them apply to the particular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires the exercise of\nsound discretion in light of the record evidence as a whole.\u201d  See ISCR Case No. 05-03635 at 3\n(App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2006). \nApplicant argues that the Judge erred by considering the allegations to be interrelated,\ncontending that the false statement should have been alleged only under Guideline E and the two\narrests only under Guideline J.   He also argues that, due to this perceived error, the Judge did not\n1\nproperly analyze the mitigating factors raised by the record evidence.  We do not find this argument\nto be persuasive.  There is no error in the way in which DOHA framed the allegations.  \u201cAn\nApplicant\u2019s security related conduct can be alleged under more than one guideline and, in an\nappropriate case, can be given independent weight by an administrative judge under different\nguidelines.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-09251 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Mar. 27, 2007).  See also  ISCR Case No.\n01-03107 (App. Bd. Aug. 22, 2002).  \nIn his brief, Applicant discussed various mitigating factors under Guidelines E and J which\nhe believed should have led the Judge to decide the case in his favor.  We have examined the Judge\u2019s\n\n\u201cI have reviewed the seven mitigating conditions (MC) under [Guideline E] and conclude that none apply.\n2\nMaking false statements during the security-clearance process is a serious matter, not easily explained away, extenuated,\nor mitigated because it goes to the heart of the process\u2013whether the government can rely on an applicant to do the right\nthing even when it might be against their own interests.\u201d  Decision at 6.  \u201cI reviewed the six MC under [Guideline J] and\nconclude none apply.  Applicant\u2019s involvement with the police ended some years ago.  But his criminal conduct\ncontinued in 2003 when he made a false statement on his security clearance application, which is too recent and serious\nto be mitigated by passage of time.\u201d  Decision at 7.  \n\u201cApplicant has not met his ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In reaching\n3\nmy decision, I considered the record evidence as a whole\u2013including Applicant\u2019s exhibits and his many years of honorable\nmilitary service\u2013the whole-person concept, the clearly-consistent standard, and the appropriate factors and guidelines\nin the Directive.\u201d  Decision at 7.  \n4\ntreatment of these factors in light of his unchallenged findings.   He considered Applicant\u2019s\n2\nexplanations in light of the record evidence as a whole and concluded that Applicant had failed to\nmeet his burden of persuasion.   We conclude that the Judge \u201carticulated a rational basis for not\n3\nfavorably applying any mitigating conditions or whole person factors\u201d with respect to both\nGuidelines.  ISCR Case No. 04-00536 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 29, 2007).

Facts The Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant works as manager of a technical library for a defense contractor. Prior to his current employment, Applicant was a member of the U.S. Navy, retiring in the grade of E-6 (Petty Officer First Class). In 1994, Applicant was stopped by the police for a minor traffic violation. In the car with Applicant was a young woman, whom the policeman recognized as a prostitute. Applicant denied knowing that she was a prostitute. When the woman got out of the car, her purse spilled, revealing drugs and related paraphernalia. Applicant was arrested for possession of marijuana and for possession of drug related equipment. Both charges were ultimately nolle prossed. In 1997, Applicant was again arrested. He had picked up a young woman, whom he knew to be a prostitute, with the intent of \u201cengaging her services.\u201d Applicant was arrested while in his car. Upon searching it, the officers discovered drugs. Applicant was charged with \u201clewd and lascivious behavior,\u201d possession of marijuana, and possession of drug paraphernalia. The court withheld adjudication on the first charge and nolle prossed the second and third. Applicant paid court costs of $100. In December 2003, Applicant completed his security clearance application. Question 24 asked if Applicant had ever been charged or convicted of any drug or alcohol related offenses. He answered \u201cno\u201d to this question, making no reference to the two arrests described above. The SOR alleges the false statement under Guideline E. Guideline J includes both the false statement and the underlying criminal activity.

Applicant requested that the case\nbe decided on the written record.  On June 21, 2006, after considering the record, Administrative\nJudge Charles D. Ablard denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant timely\nappealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred with respect to his\nmaterial findings; whether the Judge erred by concluding that the security concerns raised under\nGuidelines G and F had not been mitigated; whether the Judge erred in concluding Applicant\u2019s\nfalsification of his security clearance application was deliberate.\n(1) Applicant argues that the Judge\u2019s adverse clearance decision should be reversed because\nthe Judge made several errors with respect to his findings.  Specifically, Applicant contends that the\nJudge erred in finding that one of Applicant\u2019s debts had not been discharged in bankruptcy.  He also\ncontends that the Judge erred in finding that Applicant\u2019s consumption of alcohol to the point of\nintoxication was anything other than \u201coccasional.\u201d  In support of the first contention, Applicant\nattaches new evidence in the form of bankruptcy records which indicate the debt in question was in\nfact discharged.  The Board concludes that Applicant has not demonstrated harmful error on the part\nof the Judge.\nThe Board may not consider Applicant\u2019s new evidence on appeal.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.\nIts submission does not demonstrate error on the part of the Judge.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-\n12789 at 3 (App. Bd. May 13, 2005).  The findings which Applicant challenges are either\npermissible characterizations by the Judge or harmless error, in that they would not be reasonably\nlikely to change the outcome of the case.  Applicant has not met his burden of demonstrating that\nthe Judge\u2019s material findings with respect Applicant\u2019s circumstances of security concern do not\nreflect a reasonable or plausible interpretation of the record evidence.  Considering the record\nevidence as a whole, the Judge\u2019s material findings of security concern are sustainable. \n(2) Applicant contends that the Judge erred in concluding that the security concerns raised\nunder Guidelines G and F had not been mitigated.  In support of that contention, Applicant\nessentially restates the facts of his case and argues that the Judge mis-weighed the evidence, by\nfailing to given adequate consideration to the favorable evidence.  Based upon the record as a whole,\nApplicant asserts that his conduct was not of sufficient seriousness to be of security concern.\nApplicant\u2019s arguments do not demonstrate error on the part of the Judge.\nThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and whole person factors does not\nturn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the particular facts of a case.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 01-14740 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan.15, 2003).  Thus, the presence of some mitigating\nevidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.  As the\ntrier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable\nevidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the\nJudge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence,\nis not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner\nthat is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nIn this case, the Judge reasonably weighed the mitigating evidence against the seriousness\n\n3\nof the disqualifying conduct, and considered the possible application of relevant mitigating\nconditions.  He reasonably explained why there was insufficient mitigating evidence to overcome\nthe government\u2019s other security concerns.  The Board does not review a case de novo.  The favorable\nevidence cited by the Applicant is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-28041 at 4 (App. Bd. June 29, 2005).\nGiven the record that was before him, the Judge\u2019s ultimate unfavorable clearance decision under\nGuidelines G and F is sustainable.\n(3) Finally, Applicant argues that he did not deliberately falsify his security clearance\napplication by failing to disclose adverse information about his financial problems.  The Board does\nnot find this argument persuasive.\nThe Judge had the opportunity to consider Applicant\u2019s explanation for why he failed to\ndisclose the information in question on his security clearance application.  The Judge was not bound,\nas a matter of law, to accept or reject Applicant\u2019s explanation.  The Judge considered Applicant\u2019s\nexplanation in light of the record evidence as a whole, and concluded there was a sufficient basis to\nfind that Applicant\u2019s omission was deliberate and intentional.  On this record, the Judge\u2019s finding\nof deliberate falsification is sustainable.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  Applicant has not demonstrated\nthat the Judge\u2019s unfavorable clearance decision under Guideline E is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary\nto law.   \nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge denying Applicant a clearance is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Jean E.
