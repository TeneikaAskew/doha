Hecht, Esq.\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On December 23, 2005, DOHA issued a statement of reasons advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption) and\n\nDecision at 2.\n1\nDecision at 3.\n2\n2\nGuideline J (Criminal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On February 16, 2007, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge John Grattan Metz, Jr. denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nApplicant filed a timely appeal pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s findings support his\nconclusion as to the application of certain Guideline G disqualifying conditions; whether the Judge\nerred in failing to mitigate Guideline G security concerns; and whether the Judge\u2019s conclusion under\nGuideline J is arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law.  Finding no harmful error, we affirm.\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Although Applicant began drinking\nin high school, \u201che did not begin to drink seriously until he entered college in 1991.\u201d   After\n1\ngraduation from college, Applicant drank in bars about twice a week, consuming 4 to 6 beers on each\noccasion, and then driving home.\nApplicant has been arrested three times for DUI.  The first time was in 1997, Applicant\u2019s\nblood alcohol content (BAC) being .11.  Found guilty of the offense, Applicant was given probation,\nconditioned on abstaining from alcohol consumption, refraining from driving while consuming\nalcohol, enrolling in a treatment program, and attending a victim impact panel.  After completion\nof probation Applicant resumed drinking.  He testified that he would go out with co workers,\nconsume 4-6 beers in two or two and a half hours, and drive home.  \nApplicant\u2019s second DUI arrest occurred in 2000.  He was found asleep behind the wheel of\nhis car with the engine running.  Although he failed the field sobriety test (FST), he refused a test\nfor BAC.  He was convicted, sentenced to 60 days in jail (suspended) and 18 months probation,\nrequiring abstention from alcohol, refraining from driving after consuming alcohol, completing a 26\nweek treatment program, and attended Alcoholics Anonymous (AA).  In 2000, Applicant completed\nthe treatment program, upon which he was entered into a 12-week aftercare program.  Upon\ncompletion, the treatment coordinator advised Applicant\u2019s probation officer of the following:\nApplicant\u2019s \u201cprognosis is excellent provided he continues regular AA/NA meeting attendance and\nabstains from all future use of psychoactive substances.\u201d   \n2\nApplicant continued to drink alcohol following successful completion of his probation.  In\nJanuary 2004, he was arrested for a third time fo DUI.  Failing the FST, he again refused the BAC.\nConvicted, Applicant was sentenced to a year in jail (all but 30 days suspended), 2 years supervised\nprobation, requiring completion of an alcohol counseling program and installing an ignition lock on\nhis car.  \nThe following May, Applicant was evaluated by a treatment program.  The counselor\nconcluded that Applicant was \u201cguarded\u201d and that he minimized his history of alcohol consumption.\nThe counselor concluded that Applicant was in an early state of alcoholism and recommended a 26\nweek treatment program.  Applicant completed such a program, but his discharge summary described\n\nDecision at 5.\n3\nId.\n4\n3\nhim as having been \u201cminimally compliant.\u201d  The counselor rendered a \u201cdiagnostic impression\u201d of\n\u201calcohol dependence in denial\u201d and recommended AA attendance and abstinence.3\nIn March 2006 Applicant was again evaluated, this time by a board certified forensic\npsychiatrist, who testified at the hearing.  This expert stated that Applicant satisfied \u201cmost of the\nmitigating conditions and few of the potentially disqualifying conditions as provided in Guideline\nG . . .\u201d   The expert opined that Applicant does not now, nor has he in the past, met the criteria for\n4\nalcohol dependence, although he has at times in the past met the criteria for alcohol abuse.  Applicant\ndenied that he was ever told to abstain from alcohol permanently, only during his periods of\nprobation.  However, he acknowledged using alcohol during his last probation period.  \nThe Appeal Board\u2019s review of the Judge\u2019s findings of facts is limited to determining if they\nare supported by substantial evidence\u2013\u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept\nas adequate to support such a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d\nDirective  \u00b6  E3.1.32.1.  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility\nof drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative\nagency\u2019s findings from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime\nComm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620-21 (1966).  In evaluating the Judge\u2019s findings, we are required to give\ndeference to the Judge\u2019s credibility determinations.  Directive  \u00b6  E3.1.32.1.  Applicant has not\nexpressly challenged the accuracy of the Judge\u2019s findings, only whether those findings support his\nconclusions as to the application of certain Guideline G disqualifying and mitigating conditions.\nTherefore, the findings as such are not an issue in this appeal.  \nA Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation\nfor\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choices made.\u2019\u201d\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43\n(1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  \u201cThe\ngeneral standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests\nof national security.\u2019\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). The Appeal\nBoard may reverse the Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or revoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Directive  \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.32.3 and E3.1.33.3.  \n\u201c[T]here is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance.\u201d   Dorfmont v. Brown,\n913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  Once the government\nth\npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to establish any\nappropriate mitigating conditions.  See Directive  \u00b6  E3.1.15.  \u201cThe application of disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions and whole person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more\nof them apply to the particular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires the exercise of\nsound discretion in light of the record evidence as a whole.\u201d  See ISCR Case No. 05-03635 at 3\n(App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2006).\n\nThere are three allegations under Guideline J.  Allegation (a) concerns a Protective Order issued against\n5\nApplicant.  Allegation (b) concerns Applicant\u2019s failure to obey an order by a Peace Officer.  Allegation (c) incorporates\nthe same three DUIs alleged under Guideline G.  \nDirective \u00b6  E2.A7.1.2.5.  (\u201cHabitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgement...\u201d)\n6\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6  E2.A7.1.2.4 (\u201cEvaluation of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence by a licensed clinical social\n7\nworker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol treatment program...\u201d) and  E2.A7.1.2.6 (\u201cConsumption of alcohol,\nsubsequent to a diagnosis of alcoholism by a credentialed medical professional and following completion of an alcohol\nrehabilitation program.\u201d)\n4\nApplicant asserts that the Judge\u2019s formal findings under Guideline J are inconsistent with the\nanalysis contained in the Conclusions section of his decision.   We agree.  The Judge\u2019s decision\n5\nreads in pertinent part: \u201cApplicant\u2019s DUIs involve criminal conduct as well as manifest poor\njudgement.  As long as alcohol appears to be a problem for Applicant, he is still prone to criminal\nconduct.  The two other incidents alleged contain nothing of security significance.  I resolve\nGuideline J against Applicant.\u201d  However, when listing his formal findings, the Judge appeared to\nfind for Applicant on the DUI and disobedience allegations and against him only on the Protective\nOrder.  These formal findings are clearly at variance with the text of the decision.  Reading the\nJudge\u2019s decision as a whole, we conclude that this inconsistency is the result of a typographical error\nin the formal findings and that the Judge intended to find for Applicant on allegations (a) and (b) and\nagainst Applicant on allegation (c).  We further conclude that this error is harmless.   See, e.g., ISCR\nCase No. 04-03795 at (App. Bd. Jan. 25, 2007)( inconsistency between formal findings and decretal\nparagraph is harmless typographical error); ISCR Case No. 91-1449 at n.2 (App. Bd. Apr. 26,\n1993)(\u201cWhile we find the formal findings inconsistent [with the text of the decision], the\ninconsistency is not such error as requires remand.  We read the decision in its entirety to discern the\nJudge\u2019s meaning, and it appears clear that the inconsistencies identified are the result of\ntypographical error in the formal findings.\u201d)   \nWe have considered Applicant\u2019s other arguments on appeal.  He asserts that the evidence\ndoes not establish that Applicant has engaged in binge or habitual drinking, nor does it establish that\nApplicant was ever diagnosed for alcohol abuse or dependence by a credentialed medical\nprofessional or by a licensed clinical social worker on the staff of a recognized alcohol treatment\nprogram.  Therefore, he argues that the Judge erred in concluding that Guideline G disqualifying\ncondition 5  applies and that he erred in having \u201cconsidered, in parts, [disqualifying conditions] 4\n6\nand 6.\u201d7\nAs to the first issue, we conclude that the phrase \u201chabitual consumption . . . to the point of\nimpaired judgement\u201d is rationally connected with the Judge\u2019s findings and the record evidence that\nApplicant began drinking seriously in college; that after graduation he would drink twice a week at\nbars and then drive; and that he has been convicted of DUI three times between September 1997 and\nJanuary 2004, the last occasion being after he had completed his security clearance application.  See\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n., 463 U.S. at 43; see also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun.\n2, 2006).\nRegarding the second issue, we note that the Judge merely stated that the had considered\ndisqualifying conditions 4 and 6, not that the Government had established its case for them.\nFurthermore, while it is true that the official who evaluated Applicant in May 2004 is described\n\nDirective   E2.A7.1.2.1.  \u201cAlcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence,\n8\nfighting, child or spouse abuse, or other criminal incidents related to alcohol use.\u201d  \nApplicant contends that his DUIs do not constitute a pattern nor are they recent.  See Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E2.A7.1.3.1,\n9\n2.   \u201cApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns.  In reaching this conclusion, I have examined the facts of this case\nunder all the mitigating conditions and conclude that none apply . . . Applicant\u2019s three DUIs in just over six years\nconstitute a clear pattern of abuse.  The problem is recent . . . with the most recent DUI just over two years ago and the\nmost recent intoxication less than a year ago.\u201d  Decision at 7.    \n5\nsimply as an \u201caddictions counselor,\u201d with no reference to licensure or credentials, his assessment is\na matter which the Judge could properly consider as part of his whole person analysis.  The Judge\nclearly articulated his awareness of the issue and explained rationally and in detail why he was\ndeviating from the plain language of the Disqualifying Conditions.  Decision at n. 22.  We conclude\nthat his deviation was neither arbitrary, capricious, nor contrary to law.  See ISCR Case No. 95-0578\nat 6 (App. Bd. Oct.2, 1996).  \nIn any event, we conclude that his application of disqualifying condition 1 is sustainable.8\nAdditionally, the record as a whole supports the Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant had failed to meet\nhis burden of persuasion that the security concerns contained in the SOR have been mitigated.   See,\n9\ne. g., ISCR Case No. 03-15139 (App. Bd. Aug. 5, 2005) (three alcohol related incidents between\n1991 and 2003 sufficient to constitute a pattern, thereby negating Guideline G mitigating condition\n1); and ISCR Case No. 03-10302 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006) (upholding a Judge\u2019s conclusion that\nApplicant\u2019s series of criminal incidents were recent, even though the latest of them occurred\napproximately five years before the issuance of the SOR.  \u201cThe Board has declined to set a \u2018bright\nline\u2019 definition of what constitutes recent conduct.  Rather, the Board has indicated the matter\nrequires an Administrative Judge to evaluate the record evidence as a whole and reach a reasonable\nconclusion as to the recency of an applicant\u2019s conduct.\u201d)  After considering Applicant\u2019s brief on\nappeal, Department Counsel\u2019s reply brief, and the record as a whole we conclude that the Judge\u2019s\nadverse security clearance decision is not arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  \n\n6\nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance decision is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Michael Y.

Lynch denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant submitted a timely\nappeal pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.  \n1\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s unfavorable security\nclearance decision under Guideline J is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nApplicant argues that the Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance decision should be reversed\nbecause, apart from the July 2006 arrest for second degree assault, Applicant\u2019s other criminal\nincidents date from the 1980s and, therefore, are not recent.  Applicant also argues that the Judge\nerred in not applying a Guideline I Mitigating Condition 3 to mitigate his conduct under Guideline\nJ.  In support of his argument, Applicant presents new documentary evidence to establish that he was\nacquitted of the 2006 charge subsequent to the hearing in this case, and that he also has demonstrated\nrehabilitation by participating in marriage counseling.  Applicant\u2019s arguments do not demonstrate\nthat the Judge erred.\nThe Board may not consider Applicant\u2019s new evidence on appeal.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.\nIts submission does not demonstrate error on the part of the Administrative Judge.  See, e.g., ISCR\nCase No. 02-12789 at 3 (App. Bd. May 13, 2005). \nA Judge can find an applicant has engaged in criminal conduct even if the criminal charges\nagainst the applicant were dropped or dismissed.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-11906 at 3 (App. Bd.\nJuly 19, 2005); ISCR Case No. 03-21761 at 5 (App. Bd. Nov. 28, 2005).  The ultimate state court\ndispositions of Applicant\u2019s criminal incident did not preclude the Judge from making a finding\nadverse to the Applicant.  The Judge was not required, as a matter of law, to apply a Guideline I\nMitigating Condition 3 with respect to security concerns raised under Guideline J.  Considering the\nrecord as a whole, the Judge\u2019s material findings with respect to Applicant\u2019s conduct of security\nconcern reflect a plausible interpretation of the record evidence. \nThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions does not turn simply on a finding\nthat one or more of them applies to the particular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires\nthe exercise of sound discretion in light of the record evidence as a whole.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No.\n01-14740 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 15, 2003).  Thus, the presence of some mitigating evidence does not\nalone compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the\nJudge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs\nthe unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of\nthe evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to\ndemonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.\nIn this case, the Judge properly considered the significance of Applicant\u2019s pattern of conduct\nas a whole, rather than analyzing each separate criminal incident in a piecemeal fashion.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 04-12648 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Oct. 20, 2006) citing Raffone v. Adams, 468 F. 2d 860\n(2  Cir. 1972) (taken together, separate events may have a significance that is missing when each\nnd\nevent is viewed in isolation).  The Judge based her adverse decision, in part, on the fact that\nApplicant had not offered any independent evidence of rehabilitation and positive changes in\n\n3\nbehavior.  It was not unreasonable for the Judge to expect the Applicant to present evidence to\nestablish mitigation in that regard.\nIn her decision, the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the\nlength and seriousness of the disqualifying conduct and considered the possible application of\nrelevant mitigating conditions.  She found for Applicant with respect to the Guideline H allegations.\nHowever, the Judge reasonably explained why the evidence which the Applicant had presented in\nmitigation under Guideline J was insufficient to overcome the government\u2019s security concerns.  The\nBoard does not review a case de novo.  Given the record that was before her, the Judge\u2019s ultimate\nunfavorable clearance decision under Guideline J is not arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge denying Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Jean E.

The action was taken under\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February\n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended\n(Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President\non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs\nissued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant answered the SOR on February 14, 2008, and requested an\nadministrative determination. In his answer, he partially admitted the allegations,\nagreeing that the misconduct occurred as alleged, but denying the dates that the SOR\nalleges the misconduct occurred. On March 14, 2008, department counsel prepared a\nFile of Relevant Material (FORM). Applicant received it on March 17, 2008, and mailed\na reply on April 23, 2008. The case was assigned to me on April 29, 2008. Department\nMay 13, 2008\n\n2\ncounsel objected to the inclusion of the reply into the record, and I overruled the\nobjection. I have reviewed the FORM and the reply, and have concluded that eligibility\nfor access to classified information is denied. \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 53-year-old married man with two adult children. He served in the\nU.S. Air Force from 1974 through his honorable discharge in 1978. Shortly after leaving\nthe Air Force, he enrolled in college, graduating in 1983. Currently, he works as a senior\nsoftware engineer. He supervises 43 engineers, and has held a security clearance since\n1984.\nApplicant smoked marijuana approximately once per month from 1978 to 2002\n(Item 9 at 2, Item 10 at 1, Item 11 at 1). He failed to disclose this drug use, as required,\non three successive security clearance applications executed between December 2000\nand July 2003. When confronted by a security clearance investigator in October 2003,\nApplicant admitted using marijuana through 2002 (Item 11 at 2). In August 2004, during\nanother investigative interview, Applicant admitted smoking marijuana, but stated he\nstopped in 1989 (Id.). He falsified the date he stopped out of \u201cself-rationalization\u201d and\nfear of losing his security clearance (Id.).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, they are applied together with the factors listed in the\nadjudicative process. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a scrutiny of a\nnumber of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge\nmust consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present,\nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security. Under Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged\nin the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is responsible for presenting\n\u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by\napplicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden\nof persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision. \n\nDISCR OSD Case No. 89-1586 (App. Bd., October 26, 1990).\n1\n3\nAnalysis\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nUnder this guideline, \u201cconduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified\ninformation.\u201d Applicant\u2019s deliberate omission of marijuana use from three successive\nsecurity clearance applications, and his subsequent false statement to an agent\nregarding when he stopped using marijuana trigger the application of AG \u00b6 16(a),\n\u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel\nsecurity questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct\ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities,\u201d and AG \u00b6 16(b), \u201cdeliberately providing false or misleading information\nconcerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent\nmedical authority or other official government representative.\u201d\nApplicant omitted his marijuana use from the security clearance applications and\nmisled the government investigator about it because he feared he would lose his\nsecurity clearance if disclosed. Lying to the government in the belief that it is necessary\nto save one\u2019s security clearance does not mitigate the personal conduct security\nconcern.  Applicant has failed to mitigate the personal conduct security concern.\n1\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nUnder this guideline, \u201ccriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness.\u201d Because Applicant\u2019s falsifications constitute felonies\nunder 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001, AG \u00b6 30(a) applies. Given the recurrent and recent nature of\nApplicant\u2019s falsifications, I conclude none of the mitigating conditions apply. Applicant\nhas not mitigated the criminal conduct security concern.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a), as follows: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and\n\n4\nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;\n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nI remain troubled by Applicant\u2019s multiple falsifications of his security clearance\napplication. Even after disclosing it to a government investigator, he continued to\nprovide false information about the duration of his use. Upon considering the whole\nperson factors, particularly, the significance, recency, and recurrent nature of the\nconduct, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                             \n_________________\nMARC E. CURRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to him pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20,\n1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended, and\nmodified, on September 27, 2005, detailing the basis for its decision  security concerns raised under\nGuideline J (Criminal Conduct) of the Directive.  Applicant answered the SOR in writing on October\n7, 2005 and November 1, 2005, and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge.  The\ncase was assigned to another administrative judge on June 20, 2006, and transferred to me on\nDecember 18, 2006, due to caseload considerations.  The Notice of Hearing was issued on December\n28, 2006.  I convened a hearing on January 17, 2007, to consider whether it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  The government offered\nthirteen exhibits, marked as exhibits 1-13.  Applicant offered no exhibits.  I kept the record open\nuntil January 26, 2007, to allow Applicant to file additional documents.  On January 22, 2007, he\nfiled three exhibits, marked as Applicants Exhibits A, B, and C.  The government had no objection.\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits A through C are admitted.  DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on\nJanuary 25, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted the one allegation in the SOR.  The admission is incorporated herein as\na finding of fact.  After a complete and thorough review of the evidence, and upon due consideration\nof same, I make the following additional findings of fact: \nApplicant is a 34-year-old engineering technician with a federal contractor.   He is divorced,\n1\nhas two children, one of whom resides with him, and he is engaged.   He has an associates degree\n2\nin engineering technology, has no military service, and this is his first security clearance.3\nIn 2003, Applicant and his former wife, who started separation proceedings in 2001, had\ndrawn up a separation agreement between the two of them, but the document had not been filed in\ncourt.  Applicant\u2019s ex-wife was in a relationship with another man, who had called Applicant on the\nphone and had threatened to \u201ckick his butt.\u201d  Applicant had been drinking, lost his temper, drove to\nthis man\u2019s house, and pulled into his gravel driveway with such speed that he could not stop, sliding\ninto the man\u2019s car, forcing it through the garage door.  He then initiated a fist-fight with this person.4\nOn May 6, 2003, Applicant was arrested and charged with second-degree assault, two counts\nof malicious property damage over $500, and carrying a concealed deadly weapon.  He was found\n\nId. at 14-15.\n5\nApplicant=s Exhibit B (Letter of Completion, Anger Management Program, dated June 15, 2004) at 1.\n6\nApplicant=s Exhibit A (Letter From Probation and Parole, dated January 18, 2007) at 1.\n7\nTr. 22.\n8\nId. at 36.\n9\nApplicant=s Exhibit C (Employee Evaluations, dated from August 15, 2006, going back to February 25, 1997) at 1-2.\n10\nTr. at 36-39.\n11\nDepartment of the Navy v.

He was\nsentenced to 18 months confinement for count one and for each of counts two and three, with count\nthree to run consecutively to count one.  He was ordered to pay $1,500 restitution, pay court costs\nand fees of $55, and ordered to complete an anger management program.  After approximately 3\nmonths of incarceration, execution of sentence was suspended, counts two and three were changed\nto run concurrently with count one, and he was placed on 24 months supervised probation.   He\n5\nsuccessfully completed both a 26-week anger management program and his probation.\n6\n7\nWhen asked what he had learned from the anger management class he stated:  \u201cActually I\nlearned a lot so ever since I completed it I control my anger much better, especially with the kids and\nespecially with the additional two kids that I have now, so it takes a lot.  And from this overall\nincident I did learn a lot.  I wish it didn\u2019t come to that but this is a life lesson I will definitely learn\nfrom it.\u201d8\nApplicant\u2019s supervisor stated that Applicant was a trustworthy and dependable employee, that\nhe had done everything requested of him, and was an outstanding employee.   He observed no anger\n9\nmanagement issues, and in his last employee evaluation dated August 15, 2006,  he rated him\n10\noutstanding.11\nPOLICIES\n\u201cNo one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d   As Commander in Chief, the President has\n12\n\u201cthe authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether\nan individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position that will give that person access to such\ninformation.\u201d   The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants\n13\neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to do so.\u201d   Each security clearance decision \u201cmust be a fair and impartial\n14\ncommon sense determination based upon consideration of all the relevant and material information\n\nDirective \u00b6 6.2.\n15\nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).\n16\nSee Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7.\n17\n \nGovernment Exhibits 2-12.\n18\n5\nand the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy.\u201d   An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of\n15\ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance.\u201d16\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel security guidelines, as well as the\ndisqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline.  In evaluating\nthe security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative\nprocess factors listed in \u00b6 6.3 of the Directive: nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding\ncircumstances; frequency and recency of the conduct; age of the Applicant; motivation of the\napplicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, wilful, voluntary, or undertaken with\nknowledge of the consequences involved; absence or presence of rehabilitation; and probability that\nthe circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future.  The decision to deny an individual\na security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.   It is merely\n17\nan indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of\nDefense have established for issuing a clearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe government established its case under Guideline J.  Criminal Conduct Disqualifying\nCondition (CC DC) E2.A10.1.3.1.(Allegations or admissions of criminal conduct, regardless of\nwhether the person was formally charged) applies.  Applicant admitted his arrest and convictions.\nAnd the court records  clearly set forth the findings, convictions, fines, probation, and other terms.\n18\nCriminal Conduct Mitigating Condition (CC MC) E2.A10.1.3.1. (The criminal behavior was\nnot recent) applies.  This criminal offense occurred almost four years ago. \nCriminal Conduct Mitigating Condition E2.A10.1.3.2. (The crime was an isolated incident)\napplies.  This is the only criminal activity on Applicant\u2019s record.  \nAnother mitigating condition is CC MC E2.A10.1.3.3. (The person was pressured or coerced\ninto committing the act and those pressures are no longer present in that person's life).  Applicant\u2019s\nthen-wife\u2019s boyfriend had called him and threatened to \u201ckick his butt.\u201d  Given the circumstances,\nthis is certainly a provocation.  However, Applicant could have avoided the situation, but did not.\nInstead, he voluntarily chose to drive to the man\u2019s house and provoked a fist fight.  Applicant put\nhimself into the situation that resulted in an altercation.  Applicant was not pressured into\ncommitting the act.  This mitigating condition does not apply. \n\nId.\n20\nId.\n21\n6\nFinally, CC MC E2.A10.1.3.6. (There is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation) is\napplicable.  Applicant successfully completed a 26-week anger management course.  He stated that\nhe had learned a valuable lesson by taking the course.  He relates better with his children and step-\nchildren.  He shows no anger management problems at work.  He is no longer involved in the\nsituation with his former wife.  I find that he has rehabilitated himself, and conclude Guideline J for\nApplicant.\nWhole Person Analysis\n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a persons life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.\u201d   Available, reliable\n19\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in\nreaching a determination.   In evaluating Applicant\u2019s case, in addition to the disqualifying and\n20\nmitigating conditions, I also considered the whole person concept in evaluating Applicant\u2019s risk and\nvulnerability in protecting our national interests.  \n21\nAs noted above, Applicant\u2019s offenses are sufficiently serious to raise a security concern.  His\nactions were knowledgeable and voluntary.  He is 34 years old, sufficiently mature to be fully\nresponsible for his conduct.  The motivation for his offense was anger at his wife for her marital\ninfidelity.  His conduct was not prudent or responsible.  This offense creates doubt about his\njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness, and it calls into question his ability or willingness to\ncomply with laws, rules and regulations.\nApplicant presented substantial extenuating and mitigating evidence.  His anger towards his\nwife for her betrayal of their marriage is reasonable and understandable.  His wife was seeing another\nman.  That man called Applicant and threatened to kick his butt.  Applicant\u2019s crime occurred in the\nheat and passion of the moment.  He successfully completed an anger management course and his\ncourt-ordered probation.  His crime occurred in May 2003, and not recent.  He disclosed his criminal\nrecord on his SF 86.  He has been an outstanding employee for the contractor.  Their subsequent\ndivorce and the passage of time has relieved much of the stress of this situation, and reduced the\npotential of more violence.  The absence of evidence of any prior violence, his forthright and candid\nstatement at his hearing, and his evident sincerity about avoiding future violence all weigh in his\nfavor. \nIn sum, the likelihood of recurrence is very low because sufficient evidence was presented\nabout improvement in his mental and emotional understanding of his situation, and responses to\nstress.  The counseling and therapy he received are particularly important because he now has better\nand clearer perceptions of his reaction to stress and understands how to avoid problematic situations.\nHis rehabilitative efforts have removed my doubts about his reliability, trustworthiness, and good\njudgment.\n\n7\nThe totality of the record raises no reasonable and persistent doubts about Applicant's ability\nto protect classified information and to exercise the requisite good judgment and discretion expected\nof one in whom the government entrusts its interests.  I conclude it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1.

On\n1\nAugust 29, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of\nReasons (SOR) to Applicant, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department\nof Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified. The SOR detailed reasons under\nGuideline J (Criminal Conduct), Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption), and Guideline E (Personal\nConduct) why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that\nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for\nApplicant, and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance\nshould be granted or revoked.\nIn a document, dated September 21, 2006, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and\nrequested an in-person hearing. The case was assigned to me on February 12, 2007. A Notice of\nHearing was issued on February 21, 2007, scheduling the hearing for March 7, 2007. The hearing\nwas conducted as scheduled. At the hearing, the Government offered eight exhibits, Exs. 1-8.\nApplicant did not offer any exhibits. The exhibits were admitted into the record without objection.\nThe transcript (Tr.) was received on March 15, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted the allegations under Guideline J, criminal behavior, subparagraphs1.a-\n1.d, Guideline G, alcohol consumption, subparagraph 2.a, and Guideline E, personal conduct,\nsubparagraph 3.a. Applicant\u2019s admissions to the allegations in the SOR are incorporated herein. He\ndenied the allegation in subparagraph 3.b. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in\nthe record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following findings of fact:\nApplicant is 42 years old, and since June 2003, has been a field engineer for a defense\ncontractor.  He is a high school graduate and served in the U.S. Navy from 1982 to 1986. A random\n2\ndrug test was positive for marijuana, which led to an other than honorable discharge from the Navy.3\nHe has been married since 1996. At the time of the hearing, he was legally separated. He does not\nhave children.4\nOn or about December 6, 1986, after work, Applicant went to some friends\u2019 house for dinner.\nHe drank no more than six, seven ounce beers. He fell asleep on their couch and woke up about 1:00\na.m. While driving home, he fell asleep at the wheel, and struck a telephone pole. Applicant was\n\nTr. 29.\n5\nEx. 4 (Citation Nos.

He was found guilty and sentenced. He\nattended and completed court-ordered alcohol counseling sessions for about two to three months.5\nOn or about June 12, 1989, Applicant was observed driving at a high rate of speed. He failed\nto negotiate a curve and struck a sign, skidded across a ditch, and struck a tree. He was arrested and\ncharged with DWI and reckless driving.  He was found guilty and sentenced. He attended and\n6\ncompleted court-ordered alcohol counseling sessions for about two to three months.\nOn or about July 13, 2002, Applicant was arrested and charged with DWI. He was driving\non the highway exceeding the speed limit. He was found guilty and sentenced. He attended and\ncompleted a court-ordered alcohol counseling program for approximately two to three months.7\nOn or about July 1, 2005, Applicant was arrested and charged with reckless driving and DWI.\nHe was found guilty of the reckless driving charge and sentenced. As an outpatient, he voluntarily\nattended and completed an alcohol counseling program that met twice a week for six months.  He\n8\nfound this program to be extremely helpful in understanding the underlying premises of why people\ndrink alcohol and how it impacts on each person.\nOn or about May 17, 2006, during an interview with an authorized investigator for the\nDepartment of Defense, Applicant failed to disclose that he had been charged with reckless driving\nand driving under the influence of alcohol on or about July 1, 2005. He pled guilty to the reckless\ndriving charge on November 14, 2005. Applicant denied this allegation. He contends that the\nconversation with the agent was not focused on his alcohol and driving charges, but rather focused\non the use of marijuana, which is not an issue raised in the SOR.9\nA character witness testified that he met Applicant at work in 1987.  For the past 20 years\n10\ntheir paths have crossed, and they have kept in touch. They have worked together, along with the\nwitness\u2019s son, in restoring a car. Applicant was instrumental with knowledge about building engines.\nThe three of them assembled the car, including the engine.  The witness has never seen Applicant\n11\nunder the influence of alcohol.12\n\nTr. 21, 23, 24.\n13\nISCR Case No. 96-0277 (July 11, 1997) at 2.\n14\nISCR Case No. 97-0016 (December 31, 1997) at 3; Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n15\nDepartment of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\n16\nISCR Case No. 94-1075 (August 10, 1995) at 3-4; Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n17\nISCR Case No. 93-1390 (January 27, 1995) at 7-8; Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n18\nEgan, 484 U.S. at 531.\n19\nId.\n20\n5\nApplicant testified that prior to the hearing, he did not have alcohol for a couple of months.\nIf he does drink, he might have a couple of beers on the weekend, and not every weekend. He\ntestified he no longer drives if he drinks alcohol.13\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating\na person\u2019s eligibility to hold a security clearance. Included in the guidelines are disqualifying\nconditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) applicable to each specific guideline. Additionally,\neach security clearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the\nrelevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the factors listed\nin the Directive. Specifically these are: (1) the nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding\ncircumstances; (2) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (3) the age of the applicant; (4) the\nmotivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary,\nor undertaken with knowledge of the consequences; (5) the absence or presence of rehabilitation; and\n(6) the probability that the circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future. Although\nthe presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome\ndeterminative, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured\nagainst this policy guidance.\nThe sole purpose of a security clearance determination is to decide if it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an applicant.  The Government\n14\nhas the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of proof is something less than a\n15\npreponderance of evidence.  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant\n16\nto present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against him.17\nAdditionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance\ndecision.18\nNo one has a right to a security clearance  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that\n19\nsecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  Any reasonable\n20\ndoubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved\n\nId.; Directive, Enclosure 2, \u00b6 E2.2.2.\n21\nExecutive Order 10865 \u00a7 7.\n22\n6\nin favor of protecting such sensitive information.  The decision to deny an individual a security\n21\nclearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an indication\n22\nthat the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have\nestablished for issuing a clearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards, and I reach the\nfollowing conclusions.\nCriminal Conduct\nCriminal conduct is a security concern because a history or pattern of criminal activity creates\ndoubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. The Government has established a\nprima facie case for disqualification under Guideline J, criminal conduct.\nOn at least four different occasions between 1986 and 2005, Applicant was arrested, found\nguilty, and sentenced on either DWI or reckless driving charges. Thus, Criminal Conduct Disqualifying\nConditions (CC DC) E2.A10.1.2.1 (allegations or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of\nwhether the person was formally charged) and CC DC E2.A10.1.2.2 (a single serious crime or\nmultiple lesser offenses) apply.\nVarious factors can mitigate criminal conduct security concerns. Two of his driving infractions\noccurred in 1986 and 1989. Those incidents occurred more than 20 and 17 years ago, respectively, and\nhave been mitigated by time. Thus, Criminal Conduct Mitigating Condition (CC MC) E2.A10.1.3.1\n(the criminal behavior was not recent) applies to the alcohol-related offenses in the 1980s. In 2002,\nhe was speeding while under the influence of alcohol. In 2005, he was charged with reckless driving.\nAt the hearing, Applicant was contrite and remorseful for his unruly alcohol-related behavior. While\nnot totally abstaining from alcohol, he testified that he has moderated his drinking and will not drink\nand drive again. However, the two years that he has modified his drinking behavior is not enough time\nto conclude that he has changed his behavior when it comes to drinking and driving. He has taken\ncredible and responsible steps to avoid further alcohol-related driving incidents, he will, more likely\nthan not, consume alcohol to excess in the future since he has not abstained from drinking alcohol.\nLooking at the 2002 and 2005 alcohol-related drinking incidents, Applicant does not qualify for CC\nMC E2.A10.1.3. 2 (the criminal behavior was not recent) and CC MC E2.A10.1.3.2 (the crime was\nan isolated incident). Applicant has not mitigated the Government\u2019s case. Accordingly, allegations1.a\nthrough 1.d of the SOR are concluded against Applicant.\nAlcohol Consumption\nAlcohol consumption is a security concern because excessive alcohol consumption often leads\nto the exercise of questionable judgment, unreliability, failure to control impulses, and increases the\n\n7\nrisk of unauthorized disclosure of classified information due to carelessness. The Government has\nestablished a prima facie case for disqualification under Guideline G, alcohol consumption.\nFrom 1986 to 2005, Applicant had four arrests with charges for either DWI or reckless driving.\nThus, Alcohol Consumption Disqualifying Conditions (AC DC) E2.A7.1.2.1 (alcohol-related\nincidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse,\nor other criminal incidents related to alcohol use) and AC DC E2.A7.1.2.5 (habitual or binge\nconsumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment) apply.\nVarious factors can mitigate alcohol consumption security concerns. While not totally\nabstaining from alcohol, Applicant testified that he has moderated his drinking and will not drink and\ndrive again. The two years that he has modified his drinking behavior, when balanced against four\nincidents of DWI in 20 years, is not enough time to conclude that he has changed his behavior when\nit comes to drinking and driving. Thus, Alcohol Consumption Mitigating Conditions (AC MC)\nE2.A10.1.3.61 (the alcohol-related incidents do not indicate a pattern) and AC MC E2.A10.1.3.6\n(there is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation) do not apply. Applicant has not mitigated the\nGovernment\u2019s case. Accordingly, allegation 2.a of the SOR is concluded against Applicant.\nPersonal Conduct\nPersonal conduct is always a security concern because it asks the central question whether the\nperson\u2019s past conduct justifies confidence the person can be trusted to properly safeguard classified\ninformation. The Government has established a prima facie case for disqualification under Guideline\nE, personal conduct.\nHonesty is critical to a position of trust in safeguarding classified information. On at least four\ndifferent occasions between 1986 and 2005, Applicant was arrested, found guilty, and sentenced on\neither DWI or reckless driving charges. Applicant intentionally misled the investigator when he failed\nto disclose he had been charged with reckless driving in 2005. He indicates he misunderstood the\nquestions asked of him by the agent. Moreover, he contends that the conversation with the agent was\nnot focused on his alcohol and driving charges, but rather focused on a question regarding the use of\nmarijuana, which is not an issue raised in the SOR. Even if all of that is true, he also knew that\nadmitting to a 2005 drinking and driving charge could stand in the way of his employment. Thus,\nPersonal Conduct Disqualifying Conditions (PC DC) E2.A5.1.2.1 (reliable, unfavorable information\nprovided by associates, employers, coworkers, neighbors, and other acquaintances), PC DC\nE2.A5.1.2.2 (the deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from\nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct\ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security\nclearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities), PC DC E2.A5.1.2.5 (a\npattern of dishonesty or rule violations, including violation of any written or recorded agreement\nmade between the individual and the agency) apply.\nVarious factors can mitigate personal conduct security concerns. However, none of the\navailable Personal Conduct Mitigating Conditions apply. Applicant has not mitigated the\nGovernment\u2019s case. Accordingly, allegations 3.a and 3.b of the SOR are concluded against Applicant.\nI have considered all the evidence in the case. I have also considered the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nconcept in evaluating Applicant\u2019s risk and vulnerability in protecting our national interests. Applicant\n\n8\nat 42, appeared composed, contrite, and remorseful for his driving infractions involving an excess\nconsumption of alcohol and then driving while inebriated. He has moderated his drinking during the\nlast two years. Although he has taken credible and responsible steps to avoid further alcohol-related\ndriving incidents, he will, more likely than not, consume alcohol to excess in the future. For the\nreasons stated, I conclude Applicant is not suitable for access to classified information.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1. Guideline J (Criminal Conduct):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2.

This action was taken under Executive Order 10865, dated\nFebruary 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive 5220.6, dated January 2, 1992, as amended.\nDOHA received her answer and request for a hearing on February 7, 2007.\nThe case was assigned to me on April 12, 2007. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on May 2,\n2007, scheduling it for May 22, 2007. During the hearing, I received five government exhibits, three\nApplicant exhibits, and Applicant\u2019s testimony.

She received probation before judgment, fined, sentenced to 15 months probation,\nand ordered to receive alcohol counseling.7\nConsistent with the court order, Applicant attended outpatient alcohol counseling from\nDecember 1999 to July 2000. It consisted of group therapy once per week, and Alcoholic\u2019s\nAnonymous session twice a week.  Although Applicant was never diagnosed with alcohol\n8\ndependence, the record is inconclusive with respect to whether she was diagnosed with alcohol abuse.\nShe completed the counseling successfully. The clinician recommended that she \u201cremain abstinent\nwhile increasing knowledge of alcohol abuse and alcoholism.\u201d9\nApplicant remained alcohol-free for the remainder of probation. After it ended, she resumed\nconsuming alcohol at the pre-arrest level.  She was arrested and charged again with DUI in May\n10\n2003. She was found guilty and sentenced to three years probation.11\nAt the hearing, Applicant testified that she currently only drinks alcohol on birthdays and\nholidays.  Later, she testified that she still comes to work hungover once every two months.\n12\n13\nOn February 1, 2002, Applicant electronically submitted a security clearance application (SF\n86). She omitted her 1999 arrest and charge of DUI in response to Question 24 (Your Police Record -\nAlcohol/Drug Offenses  Have you ever been charged with or convicted of any offenses related to\nalcohol or drugs?). Also, she omitted alcohol-related counseling she attended from December 1999\nto July 2000, in response to Question 30 (Your Use of Alcohol  In the past 7 years, has your use of\nalcoholic beverages (such as liquor, beer, or wine) resulted in any alcohol-related treatment or\ncounseling (such as for alcohol abuse or alcoholism?).\nDuring a 2003 interview  with an investigator, she stated she omitted the 1999 charge because\nshe thought she only had to disclose it if it resulted in a conviction, and she omitted the counseling\nbecause she was \u201cafraid [she] would not get her security clearance if [she] had listed it.\u201d  When\n14\nasked why she excluded the counseling at the hearing, she testified, \u201cI don\u2019t know why I put \u2018no.\u2019\u201d15\n\nSee generally, Directive, Sec. 2.3, Sec. 2.5.3, Sec. 3.2, and Sec. 4.2.\n16\n4\nPOLICIES\nThe adjudicative guidelines, as revised December 29, 2005, and implemented September 1,\n2006, apply to the analysis of this case. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each\nguideline, they are divided into those that may be considered in deciding whether to deny or revoke\nan individual\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information (disqualifying conditions) and those that\nmay be considered in deciding whether to grant an individual\u2019s eligibility for access to classified\ninformation (mitigating conditions).\nBecause the entire process is a scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person\nconcept,\u201d all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and\nunfavorable, should be considered in making a meaningful decision. Specifically these are: (1) the\nnature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances; (2) the frequency and recency\nof the conduct; (3) the age of the applicant; (4) the motivation of the applicant, and the extent to\nwhich the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the\nconsequences; (5) the absence or presence of rehabilitation; and (6) the probability that the\ncircumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future.\nThe following adjudicative guidelines are raised:\nGuideline G - Alcohol Consumption: Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to\nthe exercise of questionable judgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.\nGuideline E - Personal Conduct: Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Of\nspecial interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security\nclearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nConditions pertaining to these guidelines that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying,\nas well as those which could mitigate security concerns, are set forth and discussed in the conclusions\nbelow.\nSince the protection of national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision in\neach case must be reached by applying the standard that the issuance of the clearance is \u201cclearly\nconsistent with the national interest.\u201d   In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions\n16\nthat are based on the evidence contained in the record.\nThe Government is responsible for presenting evidence to establish facts in the SOR that have\nbeen controverted. The applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by the Government, and has the ultimate burden\nof persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\n\nSee Personal Conduct section, infra.\n17\n5\nCONCLUSIONS\nAlcohol Consumption\nBetween 1990 and 2003, Applicant consumed alcohol heavily, and was arrested twice for\nDUI. Alcohol Consumption Disqualifying Conditions (AC DC) 22 (a): alcohol related incidents away\nfrom work, such as driving while under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the\npeace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol\nabuser or alcohol dependent, and AC DC 22 (c): habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the\npoint of impaired judgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser\nor alcohol dependent, apply.\nI have considered all the mitigating conditions and conclude none apply. The fact that\nApplicant has not had another DUI arrest since 2002 weighs in her favor. However, she provided\ncontradictory evidence with respect to how much alcohol she currently drinks. These contradictions\nin tandem with the lack of credibility demonstrated by falsifying the SF-86  undermine the probative\n17\nvalue of her contention that her alcohol use no longer poses a concern. Applicant has not mitigated\nthe alcohol consumption security concern. \nPersonal Conduct\nApplicant\u2019s SF-86 omissions trigger the issue of whether Personal Conduct (PC DC) 16 (a):\ndeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security\nquestionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine\nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or\ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities, applies. Applicant\u2019s credibility was undermined\nby her multiple explanations for the omissions. PC DC 16 (a) applies without mitigation, and she has\nnot mitigated the personal conduct security concern. \nWhole Person Concept\nBy failing to disclose relevant information about her alcohol history when completing her SF-\n86, Applicant elevated personal expedience over truth. In doing so, she generated unmitigated security\nconcerns relating to both her personal conduct, and her alcohol consumption. Upon evaluating\nApplicant\u2019s security clearance worthiness in the context of the whole person concept, I conclude she\nhas not mitigated the security concerns. Clearance is denied.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\n\n6\nParagraph 1 \u2013 Guideline G:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2 - Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

Jeffreys, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\n\n2\nApplicant is a 44-year-old help desk analyst employed by a federal contractor.  She had a\nhistory of delinquent debts.  She filed and successfully completed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy plan.  She\nestablished a plan of action for her finances with her mortgage broker.  All delinquent debts were\npaid.  She successfully mitigated the security concerns about financial considerations.  Clearance is\ngranted.\n\nGovernment Exhibit 1, Standard Form (SF) 86, Security Clearance Application, dated May 19, 2000.\n1\nTr. at 12, 15.\n2\nId. at 12.\n3\nId. at 13-14.\n4\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn May19, 2000, Applicant submitted a Security Clearance Application (SF 86).   The Defense Office of Hearings and\n1\nAppeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  As required by\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 \u00b6 E3.1.2 Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance\nReview Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on\nMarch 30, 2006, detailing the basis for its decision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline F\n(Financial Considerations) of the Directive. The President issued revised adjudicative guidelines\n(AG) on December 30, 2005. DoD implemented them effective September 1, 2006.  Pending official\namendment/reissue of DoD Directive 5220.6, the AG are to be used in all cases when the SOR is\nissued on or after September 1, 2006.  Because the SOR was issued prior to September 1, 2006,\nDOHA policy requires that this case proceed under the former guidelines.\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on May 30, 2006, and elected to have a hearing\nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on February 1, 2007, and a Notice of\nHearing was dated on February 16, 2007.  I convened a hearing on March 7, 2007, to consider\nwhether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant's  security\nclearance.  The government offered eight exhibits, marked as Exhibits 1-8.  Applicant offered no\nexhibits  I kept the record open until March 23, 2007, to allow Applicant the time to file additional\ndocuments.  She filed nine documents, received March 23, 2007,  that were marked as Applicant\u2019s\nExhibits A-I.  The government objected to Exhibits B and E, which were sustained.  The government\nfiled one exhibit marked as Exhibit 9, and without objection it was admitted.  Applicant's Exhibits\nA, C, D, F, G, H, and I are admitted.  DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on March 15, 2007.\n  \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted the allegations contained in SOR subparagraphs 1.a., 1.b., 1.c., 1.e., 1.f.,\nand 1.k.  She denied all other allegations.  The admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact.\nAfter a thorough review of the evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact: \nApplicant is a 44-year-old help desk analyst employed by a federal contractor.   She was\n2\ndivorced in 1994,  and has three children.   She is a high school graduate, she has no military service,\n3\nand she has held a security clearance since 1993.4\nThe SOR detailed Applicant\u2019s financial history, including bankruptcy filings and a list of\ndelinquent debts, as follows:\n\nId. at 18; Applicant\u2019s Exhibit D (Real estate Closing Statement, dated May 30, 2006) at 1-5.\n5\nId. at 19; Applicant\u2019s Exhibit D, supra, note 5, at 1-5.\n6\nId. \n7\nId.\n8\nId. at 20.\n9\nId. \n10\nId. at 21.\n11\nId. \n12\nId. \n13\nId. at 17.\n14\n Applicant\u2019s Exhibit C (Notice of Completion of Chapter 13 Plan, dated July 13, 2006) at 1-4.\n15\nId. at 20.\n16\n4\nSOR \u00b6\nDebt\nAmount\nCurrent Status\n1.a.\nChapter 13 bankruptcy 11/16/99\nDischarged 6/19/03 \n1.b.\nChapter 13 bankruptcy 11/7/03\nDismissed 8/16/04\n1.c.\nChapter 13 bankruptcy 10/27/04\nDischarged 7/13/2006\n1.d.\nJudgment\n$714\nPaid5\n1.e.\nCollection account\n$2551\nPaid6\n1.f.\nCollection account\n$291\nPaid7\n1.g.\nCollection account\n$380\nPaid8\n1.h.\nReturned check\n$149\nPaid9\n1.i.\nReturned check\n$110\nPaid10\n1.j.\nReturned check\n$29\nPaid11\n1.k.\nForeclosure was stopped\n$20,258\nPayments current12\n1.l\nCharged off account\n$71\nPaid13\nApplicant\u2019s second Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition was dismissed because her attorney had\nbeen disbarred.   She continued it by refiling in October 2004, and she completed the plan\n14\nsuccessfully and she was discharged on July 13, 2006.   The real estate foreclosure that was listed\n15\nin SOR subparagraph 1.k. was stopped, she still owns the property, and her payments are current.16\nShe sought assistance from a mortgage broker, who helped her improve her credit report, established\n\n Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A.  (Mortgage Broker Letter, dated March 22, 2007) at 1-2.\n17\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit D, supra, note 5, at 1-5.\n18\n\u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion\n19\nin light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.32.1).  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two\n5\na budget for her, assisted her with building more discretionary income, and to work toward the\nestablishment of a savings account.   She  refinanced the property and paid the debts listed in SOR\n17\nsubparagraphs 1.d. and 1.e.   Her delinquent debts have been resolved.\n18\nPOLICIES\nIn an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s security suitability, an administrative judge must consider\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive, which sets forth adjudicative guidelines.  In addition to brief\nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines are divided into\nDisqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC), which are used to determine an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law.  Instead, recognizing\nthe complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge should apply these guidelines in\nconjunction with the factors listed below.  An administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal\nis a fair, impartial and common sense decision.\nBecause the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept,\u201d an administrative judge should consider all available, reliable information\nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision.\nSpecifically, an administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors\nlisted at Directive \u00b6 E2.2.1: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency\nand recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the\nvoluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nSince the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision\nin each case is arrived at by applying the standard that the issuance of the clearance is \u201cclearly\nconsistent with the interests of national security.\u201d  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those\nconclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence contained in the record.  Likewise,\nI have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d  The\ngovernment initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a potentially disqualifying\ncondition under the Directive.  Once the government has produced substantial evidence of a\ndisqualifying condition, the burden shifts to the applicant to produce evidence and prove a mitigating\ncondition.   Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 provides, \u201cThe applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and\n19\n\ninconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial\nevidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966).  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a\nscintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v.Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4  Cir. 1994).\nth\n \nSee ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  ?The Administrative Judge [considers] the record\n20\nevidence as a whole, both favorable and unfavorable, [evaluates] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of\npertinent provisions of the Directive, and [decides] whether Applicant [has] met his burden of persuasion under Directive\n\u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006).\n6\nother evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by\nDepartment Counsel, and [applicant] has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a\nfavorable clearance decision.\u201d  The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the\ngovernment.20\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with\nthe government predicated upon trust and confidence.  It is a relationship that transcends normal duty\nhours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well.  It is because of this special relationship the\ngovernment must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to\nwhom it grants access to classified information.  Decisions under this Directive include, by necessity,\nconsideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information.  Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible\nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nThe scope of an administrative judge\u2019s decision is limited.  Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty,\nand patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings.  Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically\nprovides industrial security clearance decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall\nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  Security clearance\ndecisions cover many characteristics of an applicant other than allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism.\nNothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or\nin part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe government established its case under Guideline F.  Financial Considerations\nDisqualifying Condition (FC DC) E2.A6.1.2.1. arises where there is (A history of not meeting\nfinancial obligations.)  Similarly, FC DC E2.A6.1.2.3. applies where the information shows an\n(Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.)  The available information demonstrates Applicant has\na history of not meeting her financial obligations.  She has been delinquent in paying his debts, since\nat least 1999.\nVarious conditions can mitigate the security concerns arising from financial difficulties.  The\nDirective sets out Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition (FC MC) FC MC E2.A6.1.3.4.\n(The person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications\nthat the problem is being resolved or is under control) applies.  She sought help in refinancing her\nhome and established a plan with her mortgage broker to set her on sound financial footing.  Her\ndelinquent debts are paid and she has her financial affairs under control.\n\nDirective \u00b6 E.2.2.1.\n21\nId.\n22\nId.\n23\n7\nFC MC E2.A6.1.3.6. (The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors\nor otherwise resolve bad debts) is also applicable.  Applicant has demonstrated a consistent effort\nthrough the use of a wage earner plan in bankruptcy and through mortgage refinancing and she is\nresolve her indebtedness.  I conclude Guideline F for Applicant.\nWhole Person Analysis\n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.\u201d   \u201cAvailable,\n21\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be\nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u201d   In evaluating Applicant\u2019s case, in addition to the\n22\ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions, I also considered the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept in evaluating\nApplicant\u2019s risk and vulnerability in protecting our national interests.   Applicant has taken the\n23\nnecessary steps to resolve her indebtedness.  The totality of the record  raises no reasonable and\npersistent doubts about Applicant's ability to protect classified information and to exercise the\nrequisite good judgment and discretion expected of one in whom the government entrusts its\ninterests.  I conclude it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s\nsecurity clearance.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1.

    "summary": "findings of fact are relevant to the issues in this appeal: Applicant is a 53-year-old systems engineer for a defense contractor. Her elderly parents are citizens and residents of Iran and are her only ties to that country. Her parents received \u201cGreen Cards\u201d in the 1980s, and have visited the U.S., but they never moved here due to health and language concerns. Applicant\u2019s parents owned a home supplies store, but are now retired. Applicant has four sisters and a brother, all of whom emigrated to the U.S. and became U.S. citizens. On approximately four occasions over 33 years (coinciding with the Persian New Year, Mother\u2019s Day or Father\u2019s Day) Applicant sent approximately $200.00 to her parents in Iran. Applicant calls her parents about \u201cevery week.\u201d The Administrative Judge concluded that Iran is clearly recognized as hostile to the United States, which places a heavy burden on Applicant to overcome her parents\u2019 presence in that country. Applicant traveled to Iran in September or October 1999 and from December 2000 to January 2001, during periods when her security clearance was not active. She entered and exited Iran using an Iranian passport because she wanted to visit her parents. She had heard that Iranian authorities would still consider her to be an Iranian citizen, and might take away her U.S. passport, leaving her stranded in Iran. Her Iranian passport expired in 2001. She has renounced her Iranian citizenship, returned the passport and she does not intend to renew it. ",

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On September 14, 2005, DOHA issued a statement of reasons advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) and\nGuideline C (Foreign Preference), pursuant to Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992,\nas amended) (Directive).

Sax granted Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Department\nCounsel timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.1\nDepartment Counsel raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Administrative\nJudge\u2019s application of Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition 1 is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary\nto law; whether the Administrative Judge\u2019s application of Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition\n5 is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law; and whether the Administrative Judge\u2019s \u201cwhole person\u201d\nanalysis is unsustainable in that it relied on whole person considerations unsupported by the record\nevidence and applied them in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  \nWhether the Record Supports the Administrative Judge\u2019s Factual Findings\nA. Facts\nThe following findings of fact are relevant to the issues in this appeal:\nApplicant is a 53-year-old systems engineer for a defense contractor.  Her elderly parents\nare citizens and residents of Iran and are her only ties to that country.  Her parents received \u201cGreen\nCards\u201d in the 1980s, and have visited the U.S., but they never moved here due to health and language\nconcerns.  Applicant\u2019s parents owned a home supplies store, but are now retired.  Applicant has four\nsisters and a brother, all of whom emigrated to the U.S. and became U.S. citizens.  On approximately\nfour occasions over 33 years (coinciding with the Persian New Year, Mother\u2019s Day or Father\u2019s Day)\nApplicant sent approximately $200.00 to her parents in Iran. Applicant calls her parents about \u201cevery\nweek.\u201d The Administrative Judge concluded that Iran is clearly recognized as hostile to the United\nStates, which places a heavy burden on Applicant to overcome her parents\u2019 presence in that country.\nApplicant  traveled to Iran in September or October 1999 and from December 2000 to\nJanuary 2001, during periods when her security clearance was not active.  She entered and exited\nIran using an Iranian passport because she wanted to visit her parents.  She had heard that Iranian\nauthorities would still consider her to be an Iranian citizen, and might take away her U.S. passport,\nleaving her stranded in Iran. Her Iranian passport expired in 2001.  She has renounced her Iranian\ncitizenship, returned the passport and she does not intend to renew it.  She is not a part of any\n\u201cIranian community\u201d in the U.S. and recognizes her obligation to this country and would report any\nimproper contact.  Her parents visited her three times in the U.S., in about 1996, 1998, and 2002 or\n2003.  \nHer U.S.-born husband is a partner in a pharmaceutical firm. To her knowledge, he has no\ncontact with any foreign government officials.  She is aware of her responsibility to report any\nimproper contacts.  She received a merit award from her company in March 2006.  She first obtained\na security clearance in 1990. She and her husband purchased a home in the U.S. about five years ago\nfor $800,000-$850,000.  She does not own any other property outside the U.S.\nB.

Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1. \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the\npossibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an\nadministrative agency\u2019s finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Consolo v. Federal\nMaritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620, 86 S. Ct. 1018, 16 L. Ed. 2d 131 (1966)). In evaluating the\nAdministrative Judge\u2019s finding, we are required to give deference to the Administrative Judge\u2019s\ncredibility determinations.

The Hearing\nTranscript (HT) will be cited when appropriate.  \nWhether the Record Supports the Administrative Judge\u2019s Ultimate Conclusions \nAn Administrative Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a\nsatisfactory explanation for\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found\nand the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

The Appeal Board may reverse the Administrative Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or\nrevoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.3.\nOur scope of review under this standard is narrow and we may not substitute our judgment for that\nof the Administrative Judge. We may not set aside an Administrative Judge\u2019s decision \u201cthat is\nrational, based on consideration of the relevant factors, and within the scope of the authority\ndelegated to the agency . . .\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n, 463 U.S. at 42.  We review matters of law\nde novo.\nWe are not persuaded by the Department Counsel\u2019s argument that the Administrative Judge\napplied Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition 5  in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious or\n2\ncontrary to law.  The concern here is an undetermined amount that Applicant may possibly receive\nas an inheritance from her parents in Iran, and the Administrative Judge concluded that the\npossibility is minimal that she would receive any sum sufficient to offset her significant US assets.\nThe Judge may have misstated the applicable standard.  The standards are whether the foreign\nfinancial interest could make the individual vulnerable to foreign influence, and in mitigation,\nwhether the interests are minimal and not sufficient to affect the individual\u2019s security\nresponsibilities.   The standard is not necessarily whether the sum of the foreign assets are significant\n3\nto offset the Applicant\u2019s US assets.  Nevertheless, the SOR does not raise the issue of Applicant\u2019s\npossible inheritance from her parents as disqualifying conduct, and generally, it is inappropriate to\n\nConduct not alleged in the SOR may be considered for some purposes (e.g., to assess an applicant\u2019s credibility;\n4\nto evaluate an applicant\u2019s evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; or to demonstrate\nrehabilitation).  Since the SOR did not raise the possible inheritance as disqualifying, mitigation is not relevant. There\nis no indication of an amendment to the SOR to include the possible inheritance. \n\u201cA determination that the immediate family member(s), (spouse, father, mother, sons, daughters, brothers,\n5\nsisters), cohabitant, or associate(s) in question are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a\nforeign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the person(s) involved and the United\nStates\u201d (Directive \u00b6 E2.A2.1.3.1).\n\u201cThe applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidennce to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\n6\nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by the Department Counsel, and has the ultimate burden of persuasion\nas to obtaining a favorable clearance decision\u201d (Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15). \n4\nbase an adverse security clearance determination on conduct not raised in the SOR.   Accordingly,\n4\nthe Judge\u2019s errors in raising the inheritance under Foreign Influence Disqualifying Condition 8, or\nin discussing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions associated with it, are harmless errors.  It\nwas appropriate for the Judge to consider the evidence of the mere expectancy of the inheritance as\nevidence of the close relationship between Applicant and her parents in Iran. \nHowever, the Board finds that Department Counsel\u2019s argument that the Administrative Judge\napplied Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition 1  in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious and\n5\ncontrary to law, is persuasive. The Judge recognized the hostile nature of the U.S. relationship with\nIran and the heavy burden on Applicant to overcome the security significance of her parents presence\nin that country.  Decision at 4.  The Judge stated that \u201cthere is no evidence one way or the other as\nto whether [Applicant\u2019s parents] are susceptible to pressure from the Iranian government . . .\u201d\nDecision at 4.  But the Judge appears to have improperly shifted the evidentiary burden back to the\ngovernment.   The Judge concluded that there is no record \u201cevidence supporting an inference that\n6\nApplicant would feel \u2018forced\u2019 to choose between her loyalty to [her parents] and to the United\nStates.\u201d Decision at 4.  Even when a non-hostile country is involved,  the Department Counsel\nshould prevail when neither party presents evidence on whether Applicant\u2019s family or associates are\nin a position to be exploited in such a way that Applicant is forced to choose between his family and\nhis country.  As the Directive requires, the burden is on Applicant to come forward with evidence\non mitigation. \nThe Administrative Judge later cited evidence (e.g., no history of security problems, security\nsensitivity training, and promises to report any improper contacts) for why he found an inference that\nApplicant would not be forced to choose between her parents and her country.   He also explained\nthat \u201c[t]o the degree that there is a risk, it is a hypothetical one, based primarily on the undisputed\npresence of [Applicant\u2019s] parents in Iran and her warm relations with them.\u201d     \nAn Administrative Judge is not required to discuss each and every piece of record evidence\nin making a decision, but the Judge cannot ignore, disregard, or fail to discuss significant record\nevidence that a reasonable person could expect to be taken into account in reaching a fair and\nreasoned decision.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-19479 at 6 (App. Bd. Jun. 22, 2004).  Even if there\nis some record evidence that Applicant herself would resist exploitation, that does not directly\naddress the issue of whether the parents are in a position to be exploited by Iran in a way that could\nforce Applicant to choose between loyalty to them and her country.  The Administrative Judge erred\nin focusing primarily on Applicant\u2019s relationship with her parents without including a detailed\n\n5\nanalysis of the security threat in Iran. That analysis is important to the outcome here.  In Foreign\nInfluence cases, the nature of the foreign government involved, the intelligence gathering history of\nthat government, and the presence of terrorist activity are important considerations that provide\ncontext for the other record evidence and must be brought to bear on the Judge\u2019s ultimate\nconclusions in the case.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-08560 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 10, 2006).  The\ncountry\u2019s human rights record is also an important consideration.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-\n11463 at 4 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006).  The record evidence describes Iranian\u2019s efforts to acquire\nnuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction; Iranian support and involvement in\ninternational terrorism; Iran\u2019s violent opposition to the Middle East peace process; and not\ninsignificantly, Iran\u2019s dismal human rights record. As pointed out by Department Counsel,\nApplicant\u2019s testimony underscores the official view that Iran is a hostile state that is repressive to\nits own citizens and others.  Based on her experience over a 10-day period on one visit, Applicant\ndescribed Iran as a \u201clawless\u201d country.  HT at 37.  Moreover, in order to visit her parents Applicant\nfelt constrained to obtain an Iranian passport rather than enter and exit Iran with her American\npassport out of concern that Iran could confiscate her American passport and leave her stranded\nthere. Given the security concerns posed by the Iranian government and the situation in Iran, and\ngiven Applicant\u2019s very heavy burden of persuasion, it was not plausible for the Judge to conclude\nthat Applicant\u2019s parents were not in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could\nforce the Applicant to choose between loyalty to them and the United States.  \nEven if particular Adjudicative Guidelines disqualifying and mitigating conditions do not\napply to the specific facts of a case, the Judge must still evaluate an applicant\u2019s security eligibility\nunder the general factors of  Directive \u00a7 6.3 and Adjudicative Process \u00b6 E2.2.1 (which refers to the\n\u201cwhole person concept\u201d). Any doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly\nconsistent with national security must be resolved in favor of national security.  Directive  \u00b6 E2.2.2.\nSee ISCR Case No. 04-00631 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 6, 2006).  However, given the record here, the\nBoard concludes that such an analysis could not result in a favorable determination for Applicant.\nA whole person analysis should include reasonable consideration of the situation in and nature of\nthe country involved.  See e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-24566 at 3 (App. Bd. July 17, 2006).  As\nexplained in the preceding paragraph, the Administrative Judge failed to specifically analyze the\nsecurity situation in Iran so that he could compare it with the Adjudicative Process factors,\nparticularly the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress (Directive \u00b6 E2.2.1.8), in the\ncontext of the relationship of Applicant and her parents.  The Board does not have to agree with the\ntotality of Department Counsel\u2019s comments to conclude that the Judge could not have conducted a\nreasonable whole person analysis here without analyzing the security situation in Iran and how it\naffects Applicant and her parents.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-26130 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 7, 2006).\n\n6\nOrder\nThe judgment of the Administrative Judge granting Applicant a clearance is REVERSED.\nSigned: Michael D.

The Judge made the following relevant findings of fact: REDACTED\nApplicant was born in Iran                                                                                  Applicant\n4\nspent his childhood in Iran, but came to the United States                                                                \n                         Applicant returned to Iran          He held a position                                                  \n                                                             He entered private                                                                 \n                                                                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                                                                           5\n  \nApplicant                                                                    , but retained his Iranian passport       \n                                                                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                                                                          \n6\n                                                                                                                                                            \n\n\u201cContact and correspondence with foreign citizens are casual and infrequent\u201d Directive \u00b6 E3.A2.1.3.3. \n7\n3\n                                                                                                                                                            \n                          \nApplicant and his wife are dual citizens of Iran and the United States.

Relations are unlikely to improve, given Iran\u2019s efforts to obtain\nnuclear weapons, its sponsorship of, support for, and involvement in, international terrorism, and\nits support for violent opposition to the Middle East peace process.    \nB.  Discussion\nThe appeal involves the Judge\u2019s conclusions.\nWhether the Record Supports the Administrative Judge\u2019s Ultimate Conclusions\nA Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation\nfor\u201d the decision \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43\n(1983) (quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  The\nAppeal Board may reverse the Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or revoke a security clearance if it is\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.3.  \u201cThe general standard is that a\nclearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interest of national security.\u2019\u201d Dep\u2019t\nof the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).\nDepartment Counsel contends that the Administrative Judge erred in failing to apply FIDC\n1 with regard to certain of Applicant\u2019s relatives and FIDC 6 with regard to property seized from\nApplicant. Department Counsel\u2019s argument has merit. \n    \n   \nThe Judge states that the presence of Applicant\u2019s relatives in Iran is not a security concern\nbecause they are not part of Applicant\u2019s immediate family.  Decision at 5.    FIDC 1 does not require\nthat the relatives be in Applicant\u2019s immediate family, as long as they are persons to whom Applicant\nhas close ties of affection or obligation.  In this case, Applicant has maintained contact with them\nsince he left Iran over 25 years ago.  He does not call them in Iran for fear of retribution against\nthem, but they call him whenever they leave Iran and contact him when they visit the United States.\nCharacterizing Applicant\u2019s relationship to his relatives as casual and infrequent, the Judge cited\nForeign Influence Mitigating Condition 3.   Decision at 5.  While the record evidence indicates that\n7\nthe contacts are infrequent, the totality of the circumstances of Applicant\u2019s contacts with his relatives\ncannot be said to be casual.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-24358 at 15-16 (App. Bd. Apr. 13, 2004).\nIn this instance, the Judge erred by not applying FIDC 1, and by favorably applying FIMC 3.\n\n\u201cForeign financial interests are minimal and not sufficient to affect the individual\u2019s security responsibilities\u201d\n8\nDirective \u00b6 E2.A2.1.3.5.\n4\nREDACTED\n                                                                                                                             In that regard, the\nJudge referred to FIMC 5 , but did not actually apply it.  Decision at 6.  As Department Counsel\n8\npoints out, the issue is not whether Applicant                                                                   ; the issue\nis whether Applicant\u2019s conduct and circumstances                                    have placed him in a\nposition where he may be vulnerable to foreign influence or coercion.  Department Counsel therefore\nargues that FIDC 6 is applicable.  That argument has merit.  \nBy his                                                                                                                                     \n                                                                                                                                                            \n                                That conduct puts Applicant in a position of vulnerability to be influenced by\nthe Iranian government by either coercive or non-coercive means.  This is true whether or not the\ngovernment has attempted in the past to exploit that vulnerability.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No.00-0628\nat 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 24, 2003).   \nIn concluding that Applicant\u2019s                                                              Iran were not of security\nsignificance, the Judge failed to place adequate weight on the nature of the Iranian government.\nAlthough the Adjudicative Guidelines pertaining to Guideline B are ostensibly neutral as to the\ncharacter of the country involved, they should not be construed to ignore the political/security profile\nof the country vis-a-vis the United States.  See, e.g., ISCR. Case No. 00-0317 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar.\n29, 2002).  In this case, the Judge found that Iran is hostile to the United States and has been\nidentified as a state sponsor of terrorism.  He also found that Iran is making efforts to obtain weapons\nof mass destruction and has a poor record on human rights.  Yet the Judge\u2019s conclusion regarding\nthe security significance of Applicant\u2019s                                      ignores his own findings with regard\nto the nature of the Iranian regime and the significance of its prior treatment of Applicant and his\nfamily and the fear of surveillance on the part of his family.  Such factors are \u201c. . . important\nevidence that provides context for all the other evidence of record and must by brought to bear on\nthe Judge\u2019s ultimate conclusions in the case.\u201d  See ISCR Case No. 04-02511 at 5 (Mar. 20, 2007),\nquoting ISCR Case No. 04-07766 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 26, 2006). \nThe record in this case indicates that some of Applicant\u2019s relatives are afraid to speak to\nApplicant by phone within Iran because they believe that their telephone lines are tapped and that\nthey will be mistreated if their relationship with Applicant is documented.  Other relatives of\nApplicant within Iran have denied any knowledge of him because they fear government retribution.\nTranscript at 49.  The Iranian government is aware                                                                           \n                                                                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                              Applicant                              \n                                                                                                                                                            \n   Iran.  \nThe Judge\u2019s analysis of the security significance of Applicant\u2019s situation is unsustainable\nbecause it fails to consider an important aspect of the case, fails to articulate a satisfactory\nexplanation for its conclusions, and offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary to the\n\n5\n record evidence.

The SOR, which is in essence\n1\nthe administrative complaint, alleged security concerns under Guideline G, Alcohol Consumption.\nIn a sworn statement, dated December 12, 2006, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations\nand requested a hearing. In his SOR response, Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. The\ncase was assigned to me on March 9, 2007. A notice of hearing was issued on March 21, 2007,\nscheduling the hearing for April 25, 2007. On April 17, 2007, Appellant retained counsel. A delay\nwas granted due to a scheduling conflict. An amended notice of hearing was issued on April 18,\n2007, rescheduling the hearing for May 9, 2007. The hearing was held on that date. The government\nsubmitted two exhibits that were marked as Government Exhibits (Gov Ex) 1-2.  The exhibits were\nadmitted into the record without objection. Applicant called four witnesses, testified on his own\nbehalf, and submitted eight exhibits that were marked as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A-H.  The\nexhibits were admitted without objection.  DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on May 22,\n2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the allegations in the SOR are incorporated herein.

When Applicant graduated from high school, he became a mechanic. After\nwork, he and his co-workers would go to bars and drink alcohol.  \n7\nOn May 15, 1987, he was arrested and charged with DUI. He was found guilty and his license\nwas suspended.   He was 33 at the time of this arrest.  He attended Alcoholics Anonymous meetings\n8\n9\nafter this DUI arrest. He met his wife at an AA meeting. They married and bought a house. He\nattended AA regularly for about two to three years.  He stopped attending AA when he became more\ninvolved in his church.  He had been abstinent for eight years. He started to believe that he was no\nlonger an alcoholic because his life had changed so much. He started drinking and thought he could\ndrink socially. He eventually returned to drinking alcohol every day.  \n10\nApplicant started going to bars after work due to issues involving his teenage stepson.  On\n11\nFebruary 9, 2004, he was arrested and charged with DUI.  Prior to his arrest, he had consumed seven\nor eight alcoholic drinks including shots at the bar.  At the time of his arrest, his blood alcohol level\nwas .20. He pled guilty to Reckless Driving and was fined $500 and $150 in court costs.  He did\n12\nnot attend AA meetings after this arrest.13\nOn December 4, 2004, Applicant was arrested and charged with DUI.  He pled guilty and\n14\nwas ordered to spend 24 hours in jail, fined $100 and $153 in court costs. His license was suspended\nfor three months.  Prior to his arrest, Applicant had consumed seven to nine mixed drinks. His drink\n15\nof preference was bourbon and beer.  His blood alcohol content was .20 at the time of his arrest.16\nHe did not attend AA meetings after this arrest but began to think that he needed to do something\nabout his drinking. Between December 2004 to April 2005, he had periods where he would stop\ndrinking but he did not enroll in a specific program.17\nOn April 16, 2005,  Applicant met several of his friends at a bar at 2 pm. He had six or seven\ndrinks while at the bar. They left the bar at 6 pm and went to a friend's house to play music and\nwatch a movie.

A safety interlock\ndevice will be installed in his vehicle for 18 months.  \n19\nIn response to Interrogatories answered on July 13, 2005, Applicant indicated that the last\ntime he drank alcohol was on April 19, 2005.  He indicated that he had no intent to drink alcoholic\nbeverages in the future.  He also started to attend AA classes.  Although he intended to stop\n20\ndrinking alcohol, this was not the last time he drank. In August 2005, his father moved in with him.\nHis father is handicapped. His father, a WWII veteran, asked if he would take him to the VFW. On\nAugust 7, 2005, Applicant had three beers with his father and realized that he did not want to stop\ndrinking. He realized that he could not safely drink alcohol. This was the last time he consumed\nalcohol.  \n21\nApplicant stated it was a hard lesson for him to learn that \"once you're an alcoholic, you are\nalways an alcoholic.\"  On August 8, 2005, he started to attend a lot of AA meetings and wanted to\nfind a good sponsor.  He attended a meeting daily for 90 days.  He found a good sponsor who he\ntalks to almost daily. He has been working the 12 steps. He is currently the chairperson and assistant\ntreasurer of his home group.  This is the second time he has been chairperson of his home group.\n22\nIn order for a person to be nominated as chairperson of the home group, they have to have a year of\nsobriety. His home group meets on Tuesday evenings. He goes to meetings on Monday, Tuesday,\nWednesday, Thursday and Fridays. He occasionally attends meetings on the weekend but that is the\ntime that he takes care of his responsibilities around the house.  He provided a list of the AA\n23\nmeetings he attends on an occasional or regular basis.  \n24\nApplicant attended the West Virginia DUI Safety and Treatment Program on two occasions.\nHe attended his first class on July 29, 2006, and completed the last class on September 9, 2006.

He sees Applicant three to five times a week at AA meetings and socially afterwards. He\nhas noticed a lot of changes in Applicant since he started attending AA regularly. Applicant first\nblamed the system for his problems rather than taking ownership and responsibility. He is now more\nresponsible and appears happier and more outgoing. The last time he and Applicant attended a\nmeeting together was the evening prior to the hearing.   The other witness was Applicant's sponsor.\n28\nHe is a regular member of AA and has been sober since February 14, 1981. He first met Applicant\nin August 2005 at an AA meeting. He became his sponsor in October 2005.  They are in the same\nhome group which meets on Tuesday evening.  They see each other at other AA meetings at least\nfour to five times a week. He has daily contact with Applicant.  \n29\nApplicant's sponsor has sponsored more than 100 people over the 26 years he has been\nassociated with AA. He states that Applicant is doing exactly what the people he has sponsored who\nhave been successful in the program have done. He has stopped drinking. He attends a lot of\nmeetings. He has a sponsor. He works the 12 step program. He believes in a higher power and trusts\nGod for his sobriety.  He has noticed a lot of changes in Applicant. Applicant now has more\n30\nunderstanding about what alcoholism is and knows what it takes to remain sober. He has matured\nand is more responsible. When Applicant first came to the program, his problems were everyone\nelse's fault. He now understands that the root cause of the problem was of  his own making. He states\nthat if Applicant continues to do what he does on a daily basis, he will remain sober.    \n31\nApplicant's attorney wrote a letter on his behalf, indicating that he has great respect for\nApplicant and has watched his evolvement to a genuine commitment to a life of sobriety through\nAA.  Two co-workers testified on Applicant's behalf. One co-worker worked with Applicant every\n32\nday from 2001 to 2004.  He no longer sees him on a daily basis because both he and Applicant work\nfrom home. He states that Applicant is organized and has an excellent work ethic and is\ntrustworthy.\nAnother co-worker has known Applicant for six years.

Applicant's performance\n34\nassessments for 2004, 2005, and 2006 states that he meets standards. He is rated as either\nExceptional (the highest rating received) or Proficient (the second highest rating received) in all\nareas.35\nPOLICIES\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national\nsecurity and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position \u2026\nthat will give that person access to such information.\u201d  In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\n36\nClassified Information Within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), the President set out guidelines and\nprocedures for safeguarding classified information within the executive branch. \nTo be eligible for a security clearance, an applicant must meet the security guidelines\ncontained in the Directive and the revised AGs, effective September 1, 2006.  The revised AGs set\nforth personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions\nunder each guideline.  The adjudicative guideline at issue in this case is: \nGuideline G - Alcohol Consumption:  Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to\nthe exercise of questionable judgment, or failure to control impulses, and can raise\nquestions about an individual's reliability and trustworthiness.\nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which\ncould mitigate security concerns pertaining to this adjudicative guideline, is set forth and\ndiscussed in the conclusions below.\n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is an acceptable security risk.\u201d   An administrative\n37\njudge must apply the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d and consider and carefully weigh the available,\nreliable information about the person.   An administrative judge should consider the following\n38\nfactors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the\nconduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4)\nthe individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is\nvoluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7)\nthe motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and\n\n Id.\n39\n Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n40\n Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n41\n Directive \u00b6 E.2.2.2; Revised AG, dated August 2006, \u00b6 2(b).\n42\n8\n(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n39\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth potentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and\nmitigating conditions under each guideline. Additionally, each security clearance decision must be\na fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and\ncircumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the adjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6 6.3\nof the Directive, and AG \u00b6 2(a). \nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR\nthat disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to classified\ninformation.  Thereafter, the applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain,\n40\nextenuate, or mitigate the facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.  The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.41\n\u201cAny doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security\nwill be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n42\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the\ngovernment.  The government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those\nindividuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  The decision to deny an individual\na security clearance is not a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant. It is merely an indication\nthat the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has established for issuing a\nclearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. The government\nhas established a prima facie case for disqualification under Guideline G, Alcohol Consumption.\nAlcohol Consumption Disqualifying Condition (AC DC) \u00b6 22(a) (alcohol-related incidents\naway from work, such as driving while under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse,\ndisturbing the peace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is\ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent) applies. Applicant has been arrested on five\noccasions for DUI. His first arrest occurred when he was in his late teens/early twenties. His second\narrest occurred in May 1987.  His last three arrests occurred over a fourteen month period between\nFebruary 2004 and April 2005.  \nAC DC \u00b6 22(c) (habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment,\nregardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent)\napplies.  Applicant has long history of alcohol abuse. When he was drinking, he would go to bars\n\n9\nafter work and consume around seven to eight drinks. His habitual consumption of alcohol has\nresulted in at least five occasions where he showed impaired judgment by choosing to drive after\ndrinking to intoxication.  \nThe alcohol consumption concern can be mitigated. In Applicant's case, Alcohol\nConsumption Mitigating Condition (AC MC) \u00b6 23(b) (the individual acknowledges his or her\nalcoholism or issues of alcohol abuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem,\nand has established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or responsible use (if an alcohol\nabuser)) applies. Applicant admits that he is an alcoholic. His last drink occurred  on August 7, 2005.\nOn August 8, 2005, he started to attend AA meetings regularly.  He found a sponsor and has been\nan active participant in AA since that time.  He attends AA meeting on average of four to five times\na week, speaks with his sponsor daily, and is currently the chairperson and treasurer of his home\ngroup. The testimony of his sponsor and another fellow AA member reveals that he is sincere in his\nefforts to maintain sobriety. While this is not the first time that Applicant has attended AA (having\nrelapsed after eight years of sobriety), he will have two years of sobriety in August 2007.  His\nsponsor maintains that Applicant is doing what needs to be done in order to be successful in the\nprogram.\nFinally, AC  MC \u00b6 23(d) (the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient\ncounseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has demonstrated a clear or\nestablished pattern or modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment\nrecommendations, such as participation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar\norganization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical professional or a\nlicensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol treatment program)\ndoes not apply only with respect to the favorable prognosis \"by a duly qualified medical professional\nor a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol treatment\nprogram.\" Applicant successfully completed outpatient alcohol counseling, has remained abstinent\nform alcohol since August 7, 2007, and is active in AA.  He received a favorable prognosis from a\nCertified Clinical Addictions Counselor (CCAC). However, I cannot conclude that a CCAC is the\nequivalent of a licensed clinical social worker. As such all of the elements of AC MC \u00b6 23(d) have\nnot been met.  I considered the favorable prognosis from the CCAC under the whole person factors.\nI found the testimony of his AA sponsor to be the most compelling due to his lengthy involvement\nin AA, his daily contact with Applicant, and his first hand knowledge of Applicant's active\ninvolvement in AA.\nI considered all the evidence provided and also considered the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept in\nevaluating Applicant\u2019s risk and vulnerability in protecting our national interests. While Appellant\nhas an extensive history of alcohol abuse and alcohol-related driving offenses, he has been forthright\nabout his past problems with alcohol.  He has been sober for close to two years and is an active\nparticipant in AA.  Therefore, I am persuaded by the totality of the evidence in this case, that it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant's security clearance. \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\n\n10\nParagraph 1.

He has worked for defense contractors since he was released from active duty in the U.S. Army in June 1992. He served two four-year enlistments in the Army, from November 1981 to November 1985, and from May 1988 to June 1992.

FOREMAN\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nStephanie Hess, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nTony Hernandez, III, Esq.\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant purchased and used marijuana with varying frequency from 1974 to 1985.  He\nresumed his marijuana involvement from May 2004 to September 2004, after being granted a\n\n2\nclearance.  He was arrested in September 2004 while he was preparing to smoke marijuana. He was\non his way to work in a classified facility when he was arrested.  Security concerns based on drug\ninvolvement and personal conduct have not been mitigated.  Clearance is denied.\n\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn November 29, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny Applicant a\nsecurity clearance.  This action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Jan. 2, 1992),\nas amended and modified (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines approved by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005, and implemented effective September 1, 2006 (Guidelines).  The\nSOR alleged security concerns raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement) and Guideline E\n(Personal Conduct).\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on February 16, 2007, and elected to have a hearing\nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on May 9, 2007, and heard on May 30,\n2007, as scheduled.  DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on June 8, 2007.\nPROCEDURAL RULING\nApplicant introduced two pages from a background report of investigation (Applicant\u2019s\nExhibit (AX) Q), to show favorable comments made by neighbors and coworkers about his\nsuitability for a clearance.  Department Counsel did not object to the lack of an authenticating\nwitness required by the Directive \u00b6 E3.1.20, and I admitted the exhibit.  After Applicant presented\nhis case, Department Counsel offered the first page (Government Exhibit (GX) 6) of the same report\nof investigation to show the adverse circumstances under which Applicant was terminated from a\nprevious job.  Applicant objected to GX 6 as hearsay, and I raised the authentication requirement of\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.20 on my own motion.  After argument by both sides, I admitted GX 6 as rebuttal\nevidence, using Federal Rule of Evidence 106 as a guide.  Rule 106 provides: \u201cWhen a writing or\nrecorded statement or part thereof is introduced by a party, an adverse party may require the\nintroduction at that time of any other part or any other writing or recorded statement which ought in\nfairness to be considered contemporaneously with it.\u201d  I ruled that Applicant\u2019s introduction of the\nfavorable parts of the report of investigation entitled Department Counsel to introduce the adverse\npart of the same report.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant\u2019s admissions in his answer to the SOR and at the hearing are incorporated into my\nfindings of fact.  I make the following findings:\nApplicant is a 46-year-old electronics technician for a defense contractor.  He is married and\nhas four children.  He has worked for defense contractors since he was released from active duty in\nthe U.S. Army in June 1992.  He served two four-year enlistments in the Army, from November\n1981 to November 1985, and from May 1988 to June 1992.  He was awarded the Army Achievement\nMedal for his service as a satellite communications systems repairer in March 1990 (AX D).  He has\nheld a security clearance since October 1991.\n\n4\nBetween his two Army enlistments, Applicant worked as a maintenance employee for an\napartment complex.  He was regarded as a dedicated, hard-working, honest, and trustworthy\nemployee (AX N, O, and P).  A former supervisor and a former neighbor were interviewed by\nsecurity investigators and provided favorable comments regarding Applicant (AX Q).\nApplicant was arrested for disorderly intoxication and battery in November 1978.  He\npurchased and used marijuana with varying frequency from 1974 to 1985, and from May 2004 to\nSeptember 2004, as alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b.  He used hashish 3-5 times between August and\nDecember 1983. While on active duty in the Army he received nonjudicial punishment under Article\n15, Uniform Code of Military Justice, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 815, in January 1984 (alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c), based\non a positive urinalysis for cannabis.  He was cited for consuming alcohol in public in March 1988,\nand for alcohol abuse in August 1988.  He was arrested for driving under the influence in January\n1997. \nIn July 2001, while deployed to Bosnia as a contractor employee, Applicant cashed a check\nat a military commissary that was dishonored for insufficient funds.  Although his supervisor believed\nhe knowingly cashed a worthless check, Applicant testified he believed the check would be honored\n(GX 6; Tr. 31-32, 57-58).  He redeemed the dishonored check as soon as he learned about it (Tr. 58).\nHis supervisor stated Applicant was fired for cashing the bad check, but Applicant testified he was\n\u201clet go\u201d because the site where he worked was closed (GX 6; Tr. 31, 56).  Applicant\u2019s termination\nfor knowingly cashing a worthless check was alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.b.\nApplicant resumed his marijuana use in May 2004.  He attributed his resumption of marijuana\nuse to stress caused by his wife\u2019s excessive alcohol consumption.  He testified his wife was drinking\nheavily and she accused him of smoking marijuana, even though he had not yet resumed his\nmarijuana use.  He responded to his wife\u2019s accusation by purchasing some marijuana and smoking\nit \u201cjust to get back at her in a juvenile way.\u201d  (GX 5 at 3.)  Thereafter, he smoked marijuana three or\nfour times with an acquaintance who performed car repairs for him, and he purchased marijuana from\nhis acquaintance two times (Tr. 48-49).\nOn September 21, 2004, Applicant was driving to work at a cleared facility when he saw his\nmarijuana-smoking acquaintance hitchhiking.  He offered his acquaintance a ride part of the way, and\nwhile underway his acquaintance asked Applicant to help him financially by purchasing some\nmarijuana from him.  Applicant purchased two bags for $20 (Tr. 35).  After dropping off his\nacquaintance, he pulled into a parking lot and was preparing to \u201csample\u201d the marijuana, using a\ndevice made from a soft drink can (Tr. 52).  A police officer noticed that Applicant was parked across\ntwo parking spaces and approached the car, where he saw Applicant preparing the soft drink can.\nApplicant was arrested before he could smoke the marijuana.  He was charged with possession of less\nthan 20 grams of cannabis, possession of drug paraphernalia, and use or possession of paraphernalia\nwith intent to use it.  He pleaded nolo contendere to possession of drug paraphernalia, and\nadjudication of guilt was withheld.  The remaining charges were nolle prossed.  Applicant knows\nwhere his acquaintance lives but no longer associates with him (Tr. 33-34). \nApplicant\u2019s purchase and possession of marijuana while holding a clearance and while en\nroute to work at a cleared facility was alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.e, and 1.f.  SOR \u00b6 1.f alleged that\nApplicant purchased and smoked marijuana, but the allegation of smoking marijuana was dismissed\non motion of Department Counsel (Tr. 13-14). \n\n5\nOn January 20, 2005, Applicant was interviewed by a security investigator.  He admitted the\nconduct in alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.e, and 1.f as amended, and he provided a detailed account of the\ncircumstances surrounding his conduct (GX 5; Tr. 38).\nIn April 2006, September 2006, March 2007, and May 2007, Applicant received\ncommendations for outstanding performance (AX C, E, F, G).  In March 2007, he voluntarily enrolled\nin a three-month drug treatment program.  He testified he contacted his employee assistance program,\nseeking counseling for stress arising from his wife\u2019s drinking problems, and he was referred to a drug\ncounseling program (Tr. 43-44).  He attended weekly individual counseling sessions and submitted\nto weekly drug tests.  He completed the program in May 2007 and was transferred to an aftercare\nprogram, which is ongoing (AX B, H-M).  He testified that his wife\u2019s excessive drinking continues\nto be a source of stress, but his counseling has helped him to deal with it (Tr. 70).\nOn May 29, 2007, the date before the hearing, Applicant executed an affidavit agreeing to an\nautomatic revocation of his clearance for any future drug abuse (AX A).  He testified he is willing to\nsubmit to regular drug testing or any other conditions (Tr. 35).\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d  Id. at 527.\nThe President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants eligibility\nfor access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb.\n20, 1960), as amended and modified.  Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the\napplicant meeting the criteria contained in the Guidelines.  Each clearance decision must be a fair,\nimpartial, and commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the\nwhole person concept, the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions under each specific\nguideline, and the factors listed in the Guidelines \u00b6\u00b6 2(a)(1)-(9).\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the\ngovernment.  The government must be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in persons\nwith access to classified information.  However, the decision to deny an individual a security\nclearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  See Exec. Or. 10865\n\u00a7 7.  It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the\nSecretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.\nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal\nor professional history of the applicant which disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being\neligible for access to classified information.  See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is\n\u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth.,\n36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).  The Guidelines presume a nexus or rational connection between\nproven conduct under any of the criteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.  See\nISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  \n\n6\nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden\nshifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An\napplicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec.\n19, 2002).  \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d\nEgan, 484 U.S. at 531; see Guidelines \u00b6 2(b). \nCONCLUSIONS\nGuideline H (Drug Involvement)\nThe concern under this guideline is as follows: \u201cUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a\nprescription drug can raise questions about an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, both\nbecause it may impair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness\nto comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\u201d  Guidelines \u00b6 24.  \u201cDrugs\u201d include \u201cDrugs, materials,\nand other chemical compounds identified and listed in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as\namended (e.g., marijuana or cannabis, depressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens).\nGuidelines \u00b6 24(a)(1).  Drug abuse is \u201cthe illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner that\ndeviates from approved medical direction.\u201d  Guidelines \u00b6 24(b).\nDisqualifying conditions under this guideline include \u201cany drug abuse\u201d (Guidelines \u00b6 25(a)),\n\u201cillegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or\ndistribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia\u201d (Guidelines \u00b6 25(c)), and \u201cany illegal drug use after\nbeing granted a security clearance\u201d (Guidelines \u00b6 25(g)).  The evidence in this case establishes these\nthree disqualifying conditions.\nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), (c) and (g), the burden\nshifted to Applicant to produce evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  Directive\n\u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of\ndisproving it is never shifted to the government.  See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep.\n22, 2005).  \nSecurity concerns raised by drug involvement may be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe behavior\nhappened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to\nrecur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d\nGuidelines \u00b6 26(a).  The first clause of \u00b6 26(a) (\u201chappened so long ago\u201d) focuses on the recency of\ndrug involvement.  There are no \u201cbright line\u201d rules for determining when conduct is \u201crecent.\u201d  The\ndetermination must be based on a careful evaluation of the totality of the evidence.  ISCR Case No.\n02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004).  If the evidence shows \u201ca significant period of time has\npassed without any evidence of misconduct,\u201d then an administrative judge must determine whether\nthat period of time demonstrates \u201cchanged circumstances or conduct sufficient to warrant a finding\nof reform or rehabilitation.\u201d  Id.  \nAs of the date of the hearing, Applicant had not used marijuana for two years and eight\nmonths, a significant period of time.  This period of time must be considered in the context of a\n\n7\nlifetime of intermittent substance abuse.  There is no evidence of physical addiction.  Each instance\nof substance abuse appears to have been the product of peer pressure or marital stress.  Applicant\nknew after his interview with a security investigator in January 2005 that his security clearance was\nat risk as a result of his arrest in September 2004, and he has been under pressure to retain his\nclearance ever since his arrest.  He is still undergoing aftercare treatment for his drug use.  Under all\nthe circumstances, I conclude that it is too soon to conclude that he is rehabilitated.\nApplicant purchased and used marijuana on several occasions between April and September\n2004.  His use stopped only after he was arrested, placed in a diversion program, and interviewed by\na security investigator.  I conclude his use was not infrequent within the meaning of Guidelines \u00b6\n26(a).\nWhether Applicant\u2019s marijuana use is likely to recur is difficult to assess.  His record reflects\nhigh susceptibility to invitations to use marijuana.  Although he testified that his counseling and other\naftercare measures have helped him cope with the stress caused by his wife\u2019s alcohol abuse, her\nbehavior continues to be a major source of stress.  I conclude Applicant has not carried his burden of\nestablishing this aspect of Guidelines \u00b6 26(a).\nApplicant obviously is highly skilled and hard working.  However, his repeated use of\nmarijuana between April and September 2004, while holding a clearance, and his attempt to use\nmarijuana on his way to work in a classified environment raises serious doubt about his reliability,\ntrustworthiness, and good judgment.  After considering all the above circumstances, I conclude the\nmitigating conditions set out in Guidelines \u00b6 26(a) are not established.\nSecurity concerns arising from drug involvement also may be mitigated by evidence of \u201ca\ndemonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as: (1) disassociation from drug-using\nassociates and contacts; (2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; [or] (3)\nan appropriate period of abstinence; (4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of\nclearance for any violation.\u201d  Guidelines \u00b6 26(b)(1)-(4).  Applicant has stopped associating with his\nsource and fellow user of marijuana, thus establishing \u00b6 26(b)(1).  However, he still deals with the\nstressful marital environment that contributed to his previous drug use, and he has not abstained from\nmarijuana for a sufficient period to demonstrate rehabilitation, as noted above.  I conclude \u00b6 26(b)(2)\nand (3) are not established.  His signed statement of intent (AX A) establishes \u00b6 26(b)(4).\nSecurity concerns also may be mitigated by \u201csatisfactory completion of a prescribed drug\ntreatment program, including but not limited to rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, without\nrecurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical professional.\u201d  Guidelines\n\u00b6 26(d).  The mitigating is only partly established.  Applicant completed the first part of his\nrehabilitation program and received a favorable prognosis from a licensed clinical social worker, but\nhe has not completed the aftercare requirements.\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct)\nThe concerns under this guideline include the following: \u201cConduct involving questionable\njudgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation.\u201d Guidelines \u00b6 15. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\n\n8\ndisqualifying include: \u201ccredible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is not\nsufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, but which, when considered\nas a whole, supports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness,\nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other\ncharacteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard protected information.\u201d\nGuidelines \u00b6 16(c). \nA security concern also may be raised by \u201ccredible adverse information that is not explicitly\ncovered under any other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse determination,\nbut which, when combined with all available information supports a whole-person assessment of\nquestionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with\nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard\nprotected information.\u201d  Guidelines \u00b6 16(d).  This disqualifying condition includes but is not limited\nto consideration of \u201ca pattern of dishonesty or rule violations.\u201d  Guidelines \u00b6 16(d)(3).\nA security concern under this guideline may be raised by \u201cpersonal conduct, or concealment\nof information about one\u2019s conduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or\nduress, such as . . . engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s personal,\nprofessional, or community standing.\u201d Guidelines \u00b6 16(e).\n The SOR \u00b6 2.b alleged that Applicant knowingly cashed a worthless check.  Based on all the\nevidence, I am satisfied that Applicant may have been negligent, but he did not knowingly or\nfraudulently cash the check.  Furthermore, it was an isolated incident six years ago, and Applicant\npromptly redeemed the check.  I conclude this incident does not raise any independent security\nconcerns, and I resolve SOR \u00b6 2.b in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nApplicant\u2019s drug involvement alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-f was cross-alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.a.  The\nevidence is sufficient to raise security concerns under Guidelines \u00b6 16(c), (d), and (e). \nA security concern also may be raised by \u201cassociation with persons involved in criminal\nactivity.\u201d  Guidelines \u00b6 16(g).  Applicant\u2019s association with a known drug user and seller for several\nmonths establishes this disqualifying condition.\nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying conditions in\nGuidelines \u00b6\u00b6 16(c), (d), (e), and (g), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence to rebut,\nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  Security concerns under this guideline\nmay be mitigated by showing \u201cthe offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior\nis so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does\nnot cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d  Guidelines \u00b6 17(c).\nApplicant\u2019s drug involvement was not minor.  None of the other elements of this mitigating condition\nare established, for the reasons discussed above under Guideline H.\nSecurity concerns also may be mitigated by showing that an applicant \u201cacknowledged the\nbehavior and obtained counseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the\nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate\nbehavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur.\u201d  Guidelines \u00b6 17(d).  Applicant has acknowledged\n\n9\nhis behavior and obtained counseling, but I conclude this mitigating condition is not established for\nthe reasons discussed above concerning Guidelines \u00b6\u00b6 26(a), (b), and (d).\nSecurity concerns under this guideline also may be mitigated by showing an applicant \u201chas\ntaken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress.\u201d\nGuidelines \u00b6 17(e).  This mitigating condition is established by Applicant\u2019s full disclosure of his drug\ninvolvement and voluntary entry into a drug rehabilitation program.\nFinally, security concerns may be mitigated by showing \u201cassociation with persons involved\nin criminal activity has ceased or occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules and\nregulations.\u201d  Guidelines \u00b6 17(g).  This mitigating condition is established by Applicant\u2019s termination\nof all contact with his former supplier and fellow marijuana user.\nWhole Person Analysis\nIn addition to considering the specific disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each\nguideline, I have also considered: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and\nrecency of the conduct; (4) the applicant\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent\nto which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  Guidelines \u00b6\u00b6 2(a)(1)-(9).\nSeveral of these factors were addressed above, but some merit additional comment.\nApplicant\u2019s illegal drug use was a serious breach of trust.  Although he abstained from drugs\nfor about nine years, his reasons for resuming marijuana use are troubling.  He apparently resumed\nmarijuana use as \u201cpayback\u201d for his wife\u2019s false accusations of marijuana use, and then he readily\npurchased and used marijuana with a casual acquaintance while holding a clearance.  His willingness\nto smoke marijuana while en route to a classified area raises grave doubts about his trustworthiness\nand good judgment.  He is a 46-year-old father of four from whom a high degree of maturity is\nexpected.  The timing of his entry into counseling, after he received the SOR, raises a question\nwhether he was motivated by desire to get his life in order or merely to save his clearance.  His signed\nstatement of intent, executed the day before the hearing, raises similar doubts.\nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines H and E, and\nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated\nthe security concerns based on drug involvement and personal conduct.  Accordingly, I conclude he\nhas not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to continue\nhis security clearance.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1. Guideline H:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\n\n10\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2. Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On January 20, 2006, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\nthe basis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations)\nof Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested the case be decided on the written record.  On December 27, 2006, after considering the\nrecord,  Administrative Judge Juan J. Rivera denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\n\nDecision at 3.\n1\nApplicant\u2019s Appeal Brief at 1.\n2\n2\nApplicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant\u2019s appeal brief contains no assertion of error on the part of the Judge.  Rather, it\ncontains new evidence in the form of a statement from Applicant and documentary exhibits which\nindicate that Applicant has paid off the debts listed in the SOR.  The Board cannot consider new\nevidence on appeal.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.\nIn this case, Applicant elected to have a decision based upon the written record.  The Judge\nbased his decision, in part, on the fact that Applicant had provided insufficient documentary evidence\nto corroborate his assertions that he had paid off, disputed, or otherwise resolved the debts at issue.1\nThe Board has previously noted that it is reasonable for a Judge to expect applicants to present\ndocumentation about the satisfaction of specific debts.  See ISCR Case No. 04-10671 at 3 (App. Bd.\nMay 1, 2006).  In his brief, Applicant states \u201c. . . I didn\u2019t know I needed to provide evidence.\u201d   A\n2\nreview of the record indicates Applicant was provided with the procedural rights set forth in\nExecutive Order 10865 and the Directive, including an opportunity to respond to the government\u2019s\nfile of relevant material.  Although pro se applicants cannot be expected to act like a lawyer, they\nare expected to take timely, reasonable steps to protect their rights under the Directive.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 00-0593 at 4 (App. Bd. May 14, 2001).  If they fail to take timely, reasonable steps\nto protect their rights, that failure to act does not constitute a denial of their rights.  See, e.g., ISCR\nCase No. 02-19896 at 6 (App. Bd. Dec. 29, 2003).\nThe Appeal Board\u2019s authority to review a case is limited to cases in which the appealing party\nhas alleged the Judge committed harmful error.  Applicant has not made an allegation of harmful\nerror.  Therefore, the decision of the Judge denying Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Jean E. Smallin     \nJean E.

He was arrested and charged with\ncriminal conduct three other times.

He failed to mitigate security concerns raised by his personal and criminal\nconduct. Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for Applicant. As required by Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 \u00b6 E3.1.2\n(Jan. 2, 1992), as amended, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on April 3, 2007, detailing\nthe basis for its decision-security concerns raised under Guidelines J (Criminal Conduct) and E\n(Personal Conduct) of the Adjudicative Guidelines, issued on December 29, 2005, and implemented\nby the Department of Defense effective September 1, 2006. Applicant answered the SOR in writing\non April 16, 2007, and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was\nassigned to me on May 14, 2007. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on June 1, 2007, setting the case\nfor hearing on June 27, 2007. \nAt the hearing, Department Counsel introduced Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 11\ninto evidence without objections. Applicant testified in his case. DOHA received the hearing\ntranscript (Tr.) on July 20, 2007.\n \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nBased on the entire record, including Applicant\u2019s admissions in his Answer to the SOR and\nat the hearing, I make the following additional findings of fact:\nApplicant is 45-years-old and divorced. He married his first wife in June 1990 and divorced\nin June 1992. He married his second wife in March1993 and divorced in August 2003. They have two\nchildren. He married his third wife in September 2004 and divorced in November 2005. (GX1 at 3).\nAt the age of 19, he enlisted in the U.S. Navy in November 1980. When he left in March 2001, he was\na Petty Officer First Class with a rank of E-5. (GX 1at 4). He worked as a welder on naval vessels. (Tr.\n21-22). He held an interim confidential security clearance while in the Navy. (Tr. 54).\nAfter leaving the Navy, Applicant continued working as a welder for federal contractors. He\nstarted his current position as a quality assurance inspector in May 2006. (Tr. 26). He submitted a\nSecurity Clearance Application (SF 86) in November 2002, and another one in May 2005 while\nemployed by other contractors.\nApplicant has a history of criminal charges and arrests, involving eight offenses, dating from\n1983 to 2001. They are listed in the SOR as follows:\n\n3\n(\u00b61.a) In June 1983, he was convicted at a General Court-Martial for the offense of Larceny-\nTheft of Shipmate\u2019s money, $1,200. In May 1984, the Court of Military Review set aside the\nfindings and ordered a new hearing. In June 1984, a rehearing was deemed impracticable and the\ncase was dismissed. (GX 3). He denies the underlying allegations leading to the conviction. (Tr.28).\n(\u00b61.b) In December 1992, he was charged with (1) Failure to Obey Police Officer, and (2)\nSpeeding on Bridges. He was found guilty on both counts, sentenced to 30 days in jail, suspended,\nand ordered to pay approximately $178 in fines and costs. He admitted that he was speeding at the\ntime of his arrest, but denied that he failed to obey the police officer. (Tr. 28-29).\n(\u00b61.c) He admitted that in September 1994, a Non-Judicial Punishment under Article 15 of\nthe Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) was imposed on him for stealing two memory chips\nfrom the main commissary for a value of $398. The court fined him approximately $100 pay per\nmonth for two months, and reduced in grade to E-5, suspended for six months. (Tr. 30).\n(\u00b61.d) He admitted that in August 1998, he received a Commanding Officer\u2019s Non-Judicial\nPunishment under Article 15 of the UCMJ for offense of Unauthorized Absence (two specifications)\nand False Official Statements (three specifications). He was reduced in rank to E-5, suspended for\nsix months, and Restriction for 20 days. (Tr. 30).\n(\u00b61.e) In July 2000, he received Non-Judicial Punishment for stealing various items. He was\nfined one-half pay per month for two months, reduced in rank to E-5. He was to be Administratively\nSeparated for Misconduct-Pattern of Misconduct and Commission of a Serious Offense. The\ninvestigation into the incident was later closed and he was allowed to retire under Honorable\nconditions. He admitted that he stole a digital camera but denied that he stole the other items listed\nin the SOR. He claimed he had authorization to keep certain items for his personal use, rather than\ndispose of them. (Tr. 33-34).\n(\u00b61.f) In November 2000, he was arrested and charged with Assault and Battery-Family\nMember. He had an argument with his 16-year-old stepson that became physical. The charge was\ndismissed in January 2001. (Tr. 35-36).\n(\u00b61.g) In October 2001, the state court entered an Emergency Protective Order against him\nbased on a petition filed by his spouse. The matter was later dismissed. (Tr. 37).\n(\u00b6\u00b61. I and h) In December 2001, Applicant was arrested and charged with Embezzlement,\na felony. In February 2002, the court found him guilty of a misdemeanor and sentenced him to 12\nmonths in jail, with 11 months suspended, and community service in lieu of jail time. It ordered him\nto pay an $82 fine. The charges arose in August 2001 after he took discarded electronic items from\nhis employer, a department store, in violation of store disposal policy. His employer later terminated\nhis employment. (Tr. 37-39).\nIn October 2002, Applicant petitioned for a Chapter 7 bankruptcy.\nApplicant completed a SF-86 in November 2002. Because he does not type, he filled out a\nwork sheet that he gave to another employee to use in completing the application on line. He\nintentionally did not disclose on that worksheet any information about his employment and\ntermination with the department store as required under questions 6 and 20. He did not list the\nDecember 2001 embezzlement charge required under question 21, or the court marital proceeding\n\n4\nunder question 25. He did not list the November 2000 and December 2001 criminal charges that\nshould have been disclosed under question 26. He also failed to disclose the October 2002\nbankruptcy under question 33. \nApplicant deliberately did not submit the information because he felt uncomfortable sharing\nit with another employee and felt his privacy rights were being infringed. He acknowledged that he\ndisclosed a DUI charge, a reckless driving charge and an unauthorized absence fine while in the\nmilitary. He decided that those disclosures were sufficient and he did not want to reveal incidents\nthat were more embarrassing for him. (Tr. 68). In a January 2004 interview with a government\ninvestigator, he discussed some of the undisclosed information. (Tr. 48). He did not mention the\nNavy disciplinary actions. (Tr. 64). However, he did not tell the investigator the reason he failed to\ndisclose certain information in the SF-86. (Tr. 49). \nIn May 2005, Applicant submitted another SF-86 after another employee completed it for\nhim on line. He used his 2002 SF-86 as a templet and again deliberately left out the same adverse\ninformation he failed to disclose previously. By this time, he \u201cwas already fed up with going over\nthis thing over and over and over.\u201d (Tr. 50). He asserted. \u201cI felt like I did it one time, I talked to the\ninvestigator, and that was all I was obligated to do.\u201d (Id.). He believed that his statement to the\ninvestigator was sufficient disclosure and he had no intention of disclosing the adverse information\nto another employee. (Tr. 52). His acknowledged that his persistent concern for privacy outweighed\nhis responsibility to disclose adverse information to the government. (Tr. 44-46). He now realizes\nhe made a mistake by not disclosing the information. (Tr. 53; 66). His employer is unaware of this\nhearing. (Tr. 69).\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority . . . control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position. . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527.\nThe President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants eligibility for\naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb.\n20, 1960). Each security clearance decision \u201cmust be a fair and impartial common sense\ndetermination based upon consideration of all relevant and material information and the pertinent\ncriteria and adjudication policy.\u201d Directive \u00b6 6.3. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of\ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) set forth potentially disqualifying conditions (DC)\nand mitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline. In evaluating the security worthiness of an\napplicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6 6.3\nof the Directive. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant. See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. It is merely an indication\nthe applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have\nestablished for issuing a clearance.\n\n5\nCONCLUSIONS\nUpon consideration of all facts in evidence and application of all appropriate adjudicative\nfactors and pertinent legal standards, I conclude the following with respect to the allegations set forth\nin the SOR:\nGuideline E: Personal Conduct\nGuideline \u00b6 15 articulates the Government\u2019s concern about personal conduct: \u201cConduct\ninvolving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules\nand regulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid\nanswers during the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security\nclearance process.\u201d \nThe Government alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j through 1.u that Applicant falsified both his\nNovember 2002 and May 2005 SF-86 by failing to disclose adverse information related to his\nemployment activities and record, an assault and embezzlement charge, a court martial, and a\nbankruptcy. Based on the evidence, including his admissions, the Government established a Personal\nConduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC). Under Guideline 16(a) an individual raises a security\nconcern when there is a \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material\nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to\nconduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determines\nsecurity clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.\u201d He deliberately\nfailed to disclose requested information on security clearance applications.\nAfter the Government produced substantial evidence of the disqualifying condition, the\nburden shifted to Applicant to provide evidence of a mitigating condition. After reviewing all of the\nPersonal Conduct Mitigating Conditions, I considered only one to be potentially applicable.\nGuideline \u00b6 17(d) provides mitigation when \u201cthe individual has acknowledged the behavior and\nobtained counseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors,\ncircumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and\nsuch behavior is unlikely to recur.\u201d Although Applicant honestly admitted his mistakes and attributed\nhis refusal to reveal the information to indignation or embarrassment, he has not provided evidence\nthat he obtained counseling to more fully understand his decision to withhold information. While\nI understand how he may have felt his privacy was being compromised during the first application\nprocess 2002, I find it troubling that he again decided to withhold the information in 2005, despite\nan interview about it, and justified his conduct with a belief that he had disclosed enough\ninformation. Only more recently, has he come to appreciate the gravity of his conduct. His previous\nbehavior leads me to believe that he has not alleviated or resolved the internal conflict that gave rise\nto his conduct and attitude. Hence, Guideline \u00b6 17(d) cannot apply.\nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct\n\n6\nGuideline \u00b6 30 articulates the Government\u2019s concern about criminal conduct:  \u201cCriminal\nactivity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature,\nit calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\u201d\nBased on the evidence, including Applicant\u2019s admissions, the Government raised a security\nconcern under two Criminal Conduct Disqualifying Conditions: \u201ca single serious crime or multiple\nlesser offenses,\u201d and \u201callegations or admissions of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the\nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted.\u201d Guideline \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and (c).\nApplicant was charged with criminal misconduct on eight separate occasions. He was convicted six\ntimes. He also intentionally falsified material facts on his SF-86s, constituting a felony under Title\n18, United States Code, Section 1001.\nThere are five Criminal Conduct Mitigating Conditions under Guideline \u00b6 32. I considered\ntwo of them. Guideline \u00b6 32(a) provides mitigation when \u201cso much time has elapsed since the\ncriminal behavior happened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to\nrecur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d\nAlthough Applicant\u2019s last formal criminal charge occurred in December 2001, the falsification of\nhis SF-86 occurred in November 2002 and May 2005. Given his long history of criminal problems\nand encounters, sufficient time has not elapsed since the 2005 falsification to warrant the application\nof this condition. Guideline \u00b6 32(d) requires a showing that \u201cthere is clear evidence of successful\nrehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time without recurrence of criminal\nactivity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or\nconstructive community involvement.\u201d Applicant exhibited remorse for his conduct, but he did not\nprovide evidence of the other factors listed under this Guideline. Thus, it has limited application.\nWhole Person Analysis\nIn addition to evaluating the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each guideline,\nthe adjudicative process requires thorough consideration and review of all available, reliable\ninformation about the applicant, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, to arrive at a balanced\ndecision.  The essence of scrutinizing all appropriate variables in a case is referred to as the \u201cwhole\nperson\u201d analysis. Guideline \u00b6 2.a.  In evaluating the conduct of the applicant, an administrative judge\nshould consider: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct; to include knowledgeable participation (3) the frequency and recency of\nthe conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness\nof participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other behavioral changes; (7) the\nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9)\nthe likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nI considered the totality of the evidence in view of the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept, including\nApplicant\u2019s middle age, his demeanor while testifying and candid testimony about the reasons\nunderlying his decision to withhold the requested adverse information on two SF 86s. I took into\n\n7\naccount his military service and accomplishments. However, his decision to falsify his applications\nis a very serious concern. In both instances, he demonstrated that his personal concerns outweighed\nthe government\u2019s concerns, which is a fundamental reason to deny a security clearance. His criminal\nand personal conduct create doubt about his judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and willingness\nto comply with laws, rules and regulations. Until he presents sufficient evidence of rehabilitation and\nother behavioral changes, including a longer period of time free from misconduct, I am concerned\nthat similar events may recur in the future. Thus, Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns\nraised by his personal and criminal conduct. Accordingly, Guidelines E and J are concluded against\nhim.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are as follows:\nParagraph1: Guideline E (Personal Conduct)\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a.S1.u.: \nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2. Guideline J (Criminal Conduct)\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance.

    "summary": "analysis to determine an applicant's 3 security eligibility. A whole person analysis is not confined to the workplace. See ISCR Case No. 03-11231 at 3 (App. Bd. June 4, 2004). \u201c[T]here is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance.\u201d Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9 Cir. 1990), cert. denied 499 U.S. 905 (1991). Once the government th presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to establish mitigation. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and whole person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the particular facts of a case. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-14740 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan.15, 2003). Thus, the presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On August 11, 2005, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\nthe basis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption) and\nGuideline J (Criminal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On January 16, 2007, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge Matthew E. Malone denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\n\n2\nApplicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge erred by concluding that\nthe security concerns raised under Guidelines G and J had not been mitigated.\nApplicant contends that the Judge\u2019s adverse decision should be reversed because the Judge\ndid not give sufficient weight to Applicant\u2019s mitigating evidence which showed that Applicant has\nheld a security clearance without incident for approximately 17 years, and that four of the criminal\ncharges against him had been dismissed or had resulted in a finding of not guilty.  In support of this\ncontention, Applicant restates the evidence he presented below, and offers new evidence in the form\nof an additional explanation about the four criminal charges.  The Board does not find Applicant\u2019s\ncontention persuasive. \nThe Board may not consider new evidence on appeal.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.  Its\nsubmission does not demonstrate error on the part of the Judge.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-00799\nat 2 (App. Bd. Apr. 16, 2007).  Therefore, the Board may not consider Applicant\u2019s additional\nexplanations.\nThe Board\u2019s review of a Judge\u2019s findings is limited to determining if they are supported by\nsubstantial evidence\u2014such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to\nsupport such a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.\n\u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two\ninconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency\u2019s finding from\nbeing supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620,\n(1966).\n \nThe Judge found in favor of Applicant with respect to two of the charges to which he refers,\nboth of which were alleged under Guideline J.  Therefore, those findings are not at issue on appeal.\nThe other two charges were alcohol-related, so they were considered by the Judge in the context of\nthe Guideline G.  A Judge can find an applicant has engaged in criminal conduct even if the criminal\ncharges against the applicant were dropped or dismissed.  See ISCR Case No. 03-11906 at 3 (App.\nBd. July 19, 2005); ISCR Case No. 03-21761 at 5 (App. Bd. Nov. 28, 2005).  The ultimate state\ncourt dispositions of Applicant\u2019s criminal incidents did not preclude the Judge from finding that\nthose incidents were alcohol-related.  See ISCR Case No. 02-01181 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 30, 2004).\nConsidering the record as a whole, the Judge\u2019s material findings with respect to Applicant\u2019s alcohol-\nrelated conduct reflect a reasonable interpretation of the record evidence and are supported by\nsubstantial evidence.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-21933 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2006).\nThe absence of security violations does not bar or preclude an adverse security clearance\ndecision.  The federal government need not wait until an applicant actually mishandles or fails to\nproperly handle classified information before it can deny or revoke access to such information. See\nAdams v. Laird, 420 F. 2d 230, 238-239 (D.C. Cir. 1969), cert. denied, 397 U.S. 1039 (1970). An\napplicant with good or exemplary job performance may engage in conduct that has negative security\nimplications. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 99-0123 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 11, 2000). The Directive's\nGuidelines set forth a variety of examples of off-duty conduct and circumstances which are of\nsecurity concern to the government and mandate a whole person analysis to determine an applicant's\n\n3\nsecurity eligibility.  A whole person analysis is not confined to the workplace. See ISCR Case No.\n03-11231 at 3 (App. Bd. June 4, 2004). \n\u201c[T]here is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance.\u201d Dorfmont v. Brown,\n913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  Once the government\nth\npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to establish mitigation.\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15.  The application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and whole person\nfactors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the particular facts of a\ncase.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-14740 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan.15, 2003).  Thus, the presence of some\nmitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.\nAs the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable\nevidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the\nJudge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence,\nis not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner\nthat is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-01181 at 3-4 (App. Bd.\nJan. 30, 2004). \nIn this case, the Judge found that Applicant had a lengthy and serious history of excessive\nalcohol consumption and criminal conduct.   The Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by\nApplicant against the length and seriousness of the disqualifying conduct and considered the possible\napplication of relevant mitigating conditions and whole person factors.  The Judge found in favor\nof Applicant with respect to some of the SOR allegations.  However, the Judge reasonably explained\nwhy the evidence which the Applicant had presented in mitigation was insufficient to overcome all\nof the government\u2019s security concerns.  The Board does not review a case de novo.  The favorable\nrecord evidence cited by Applicant is not sufficient to demonstrate the Administrative Judge\u2019s\ndecision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\n\n4\nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge denying Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Michael D.

Howry, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nElizabeth L. Newman,Esq.\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On July 29, 2005 DOHA issued a statement of reasons advising Applicant of the basis\nfor that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) pursuant to Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992,\n\n\u201cYour Financial Delinquencies- 180 days- In the last 7 years, have you ever been over 180 days delinquent\n1\non any debt(s)?\u201d\n\u201cYour Financial Delinquencies- 90 Days- Are you currently over 90 days delinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d\n2\nThe Administrative Judge\u2019s conclusions read in pertinent part: \u201c2.a. and 2.b.- Applicant\u2019s overall explanation\n3\nfor not citing the debts alleged under 1.a.- 1.e. is that. . . Applicant\u2019s explanations are not persuasive.\u201d \n2\nas amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On June 8, 2006, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge Barry M. Sax denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant\ntimely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.  \nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Administrative Judge\u2019s findings\nthat Applicant falsified answers relating to finances on an October 2003 security clearance\napplication were supported by substantial evidence; and whether the Judge\u2019s conclusions were\narbitrary and capricious.  We remand the Administrative Judge\u2019s decision to deny the clearance. \nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Factual Findings\nA. Facts \nThe Administrative Judge ultimately concluded in favor of Applicant under Guideline F\nregarding five delinquent debts listed in the statement of reasons (SOR).  Department Counsel did\nnot appeal the Judge\u2019s favorable ruling regarding the underlying debts.  Therefore, it is necessary to\nrecite the facts concerning Applicant\u2019s indebtedness only insofar as they relate to the falsification\nissues that form the basis for this appeal. \nThe Administrative Judge\u2019s decision contains no detailed exposition of facts regarding\nApplicant\u2019s alleged falsification of two questions on his security clearance application (SF 86).  In\nhis findings of fact, the Judge merely states that Applicant knowingly falsified material facts on his\nOctober 13, 2003 security clearance application when responding to Question 38  and Question 39\n1\n2\nby answering \u201cno.\u201d  The Judge\u2019s decision contains no analysis or discussion of any record evidence\nor exposition of specific facts that would provide support for these findings.  The Judge does not\nidentify the specific debts that Applicant lied about in his findings of fact, but comments made by\nthe Judge in the conclusions section of his decision clearly indicate that he found that Applicant\u2019s\nfalsifications extended to all five debts.   \n3\nThere is evidence in the record, not cited by the Administrative Judge, that is pertinent to the\nissues raised on appeal.  That evidence is as follows:  \nThe debt listed in subparagraph 1.a. of the SOR (a student loan debt in the amount of\n$1,507.00) is established in the record by references in a credit report dated June 6, 2005 (Govt. Ex.\n4) and in a credit report dated September 12, 2005 (Govt. Ex. 5).  On both reports the debt is listed\nas an unpaid collection item with a list date of March 2004 and a last activity date notation of August\n2003.  No other objective information about the status of this debt on October 13, 2003, the day\nApplicant completed his security clearance application, exists in the record.  Applicant admitted the\ndebt in his answer to the SOR but made no comments concerning its date of origin or delinquency\nhistory.  At the hearing, Applicant testified that while he was on active duty with the Navy, the\n\n3\nVeterans Administration was paying for his education expenses.  It was later determined that the\ngovernment would no longer provide this benefit to Applicant and the bills for his education\nexpenses were then passed on to him. Applicant testified that he was not made aware of this until\nafter he had done the background investigation. (Tr. pp. 19-20). \nThe debt listed in subparagraph 1.b. of the SOR (a bill from a medical provider in the amount\nof $ 80.00) is established in the record by references in the credit report dated June 6, 2005 (Govt.\nEx. 4) and in the credit report dated September 12, 2005 (Govt. Ex. 5).  On both reports the debt is\nlisted as an unpaid collection item with a list date of July 2004 and a last activity date of May 2004.\nNo other credit report information is contained in the record concerning the status of this debt on\nOctober 13, 2003, the day Applicant completed his security clearance application.  At the hearing,\nApplicant placed into evidence a bill (monthly statement) from the health care provider dated April\n5, 2004. (App. Ex. C).  The bill indicated that Applicant owed $ 80.44, but also indicated that the\naccount was current as of that date.  The bill also indicates that the bill was for goods and services\nprovided in March 2004.  Applicant denied that he owed this debt in his answer to the SOR, as he\nfelt it was the responsibility of his insurance provider.  Ultimately, he paid the bill himself in August\n2005 to get the matter off his credit report (App. Ex. C, Tr. p. 20).\nThe debt listed in subparagraph 1.c. of the SOR (a debt from a military exchange in the\namount of $413.00) is established in the record by references in the credit report dated June 6, 2005\n(Gov. Ex. 4) and in the credit report dated September 12, 2005 (Govt. Ex. 5).  The June 6, 2005\ncredit report indicates that the account was opened in August 1993, the credit information was\nreported in April 2005, an amount of $ 222.00 was past due and the date of last account activity was\nOctober 1999.  The September 12, 2005 credit report indicates that the account was opened in\nAugust 1993, the credit information was reported in August 2005, an amount of $134.00 was past\ndue and the date of the last account activity was October 1999.  Both credit reports indicate that the\naccount was closed at Applicant\u2019s request on an unspecified date.  Applicant admitted the debt in\nhis answer to the SOR but made no comments concerning its date of origin or delinquency history.\nApplicant made a partial payment on the account in August 2005 (App. Ex. D).  Applicant testified\nat the hearing that he paid the debt off on some unspecified date and he testified to his belief that at\nthe time the debt was paid off he believed it was 30 days late (Tr. p. 21).  Applicant submitted\ndocuments post-hearing indicating that the account was paid off in April 2006 (App. Ex. H1, H2).\nThe debt listed in subparagraph 1.d. of the SOR ( a debt from the purchase of auto tires with\na credit card in the amount of $1,923.00) is established in the record by references in a credit report\ndated April 8, 2004.  That report lists a debt report date of September 2003, a past due amount of\n$1,712.00, and a last activity date of September 1999 (Govt. Ex. 3).  The debt is also referenced in\nthe June 6, 2005 credit report where a report date of May 2005 is listed along with a past due amount\nof $1923.00 and a last activity date of September 1999.  The report also identifies it as a collection\naccount and notes that the creditor has been unable to locate Applicant. (Govt. Ex. 4).  The debt is\nalso referenced in the September 12, 2005 credit report where an August 2005 report date is listed\nalong with a past due amount of $1964 and a last activity date of September 1999.  The account is\nagain identified as a collection account. (Govt. Ex. 5).  Applicant denied that this was his debt in his\nanswer to the SOR.  Later, during his hearing testimony, he acknowledged the debt as being his after\nconducting some research.  He stated that the account originated in the mid to late 1980's and he had\nnot made a payment on the debt since 1990 or 1991.  He testified that the last he knew of the account\nwas that it had been written off as a bad debt, and that at the time he filled out his security clearance\n\nThis particular credit report was never admitted into evidence.\n4\n4\napplication, the debt did not come to mind at all. (Tr. pp. 21, 31).  In the Conclusion section of the\nJudge\u2019s decision the Judge made the following sustainable finding of fact:\n\u201c1.d - Applicant denied any knowledge of this debt of $1,923.00 and had begun an\ninvestigation to discover the truth (Response to SOR).  On November 23, 2003, he\nsent a letter to the credit reporting service disputing the debt and asking for\ninvestigation and response (AX E and AX F), Applicant now realized this is his debt,\njust one that originated under another creditor\u2019s name (Tr at 21).  He has set up a\npayment plan to resolve the outstanding debt (Id.)\u201d \nDecision at 4.\nThe debt listed in subparagraph 1.e. of the SOR (an automobile purchase in the amount of\n$14,108.00) is established in the record by a reference in the credit report dated April 8, 2004.  That\nreport lists the date of the initiation of the debt as June 2003.  The 2004 credit report also lists the\ndebt as being current and contains the annotation, \u201cpays as agreed.\u201d (Govt. Ex 3).  The two 2005\ncredit reports indicate that, by then, the account had fallen into arrears and the vehicle had been\nrepossessed. (Govt. Ex 4 and 5).  \nIn his answer to the SOR and in his hearing testimony, Applicant alludes to an awareness of\npast overdue debts and states that he should have paid more attention when answering the security\nclearance application questions and done more research into his credit status, but he stated it was not\nhis intention to mislead anyone. (Tr. p. 23).  In his answer to the SOR, Applicant indicated that while\nthere were periods in his credit history of late payments for various reasons, he honestly did not\nrecall being late on his debts for the 90 day and 180 periods referenced in the security clearance\napplication.  In his answer to the SOR (dated August 7, 2005), Applicant stated that he had recently\nreviewed a copy of his credit report and noticed that \u201cthere has been recorded history of over 180\ndays late.\u201d   In his hearing testimony, when referencing the 180 day and 90 day time frames on the\n4\nsecurity clearance application questions, Applicant stated that he was not aware of anything (any\ndebt) \u201c. . . that was lingering on me for these time frames.\u201d (Tr. pp. 22-23). \nB. Discussion\nThe Appeal Board\u2019s review of the Administrative Judge\u2019s findings of fact is limited to\ndetermining if they are supported by substantial record evidence\u2014such relevant evidence as a\nreasonable mind might accept as adequate to support such a conclusion in light of all the contrary\nevidence in the record.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the\nevidence, and the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not\nprevent an administrative agency\u2019s finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d  Consolo\nv. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620-21 (1966).  In evaluating the Administrative\nJudge\u2019s findings, we are required to give deference to the Administrative Judge\u2019s credibility\ndeterminations.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1. \nOn appeal, Applicant argues that there is insufficient record evidence to support the\nAdministrative Judge\u2019s findings that Department Counsel established its case with regard to\n\n5\nGuideline E.  With reference to each of the five debts alleged to be the subject of Applicant\u2019s false\nanswers to questions 38 and 39 of the security clearance questionnaire, Applicant asserts that (a)\nthere is no record evidence to establish that the debts had been180 days old within 7 years or were\ncurrently 90 days old when Applicant filled out his security clearance application on October 13,\n2003; and (b) there is no record evidence to establish that Applicant had knowledge of the five\noverdue debts on October 13, 2003.  Applicant\u2019s arguments have mixed merit.\n(a) Applicant persuasively argues that, with regard to the debts alleged in subparagraphs 1.a.,\n1.b., and 1.e. of the SOR, there is no record evidence that these debts were historically (within 7\nyears) 180 days delinquent or were 90 days delinquent at the time Applicant completed his answers\nto Questions 38 and 39.  With regard to the debts listed alleged in subparagraphs 1.b. and 1.e. of the\nSOR, the record evidence cited in preceding paragraphs indicates that there is no evidence that these\ndebts were ever delinquent prior to October 13, 2003.  In fact, there is no record evidence to establish\nthat the debt alleged in subparagraph 1.b. even existed on October 13, 2003.  Moreover, both debts\n1.b. and 1.e. are listed as current on documents prepared subsequent to October 13, 2003.  Regarding\nthe debt alleged at subparagraph 1.a. of the SOR, the record evidence indicates that the last activity\ndate on the debt was in August 2003, only two months prior to Applicant\u2019s completion of the\nsecurity clearance application.  There is no indication in the record evidence as to when this debt\nbecame delinquent or when collection action commenced.  Accordingly, the documentary record\ndoes not establish that the debt was 180 days delinquent during the 7 year period prior to October\n13, 2003 or was 90 days delinquent on October 13, 2003.\nApplicant\u2019s statements in his answer to the SOR and in his hearing testimony contain\nnonspecific admissions of awareness of past debt arrearages and general expressions of regret at not\nresearching his finances more thoroughly before answering Questions 38 and 39 on his security\nclearance application.  However, these statements are qualified in that Applicant essentially denies\nthat he had debt arrearages that fell within the parameters of the two questions, and he does not\nspecifically reference any of the debts listed in the SOR.  Accordingly, these statements fall\nconsiderably short of admissions that would aid in establishing that Applicant was required to\ndivulge these three debts on the security clearance application.  Applicant\u2019s statements do nothing\nto fill the evidentiary gap that exists in the written record with regard to the debts alleged in\nsubparagraphs 1.a., 1.b., and 1.e. being historically 180 days delinquent or 90 days delinquent on the\ndate Applicant completed his application.\nBefore Department Counsel can establish that Applicant answered Questions 38 and 39 on\nhis security clearance application falsely, it must first establish that he answered the questions\nincorrectly.  As the preceding analysis of the record evidence indicates, it has failed to do so with\nregard to the debts alleged in subparagraphs 1.a., 1.b., and 1.e. of the SOR.  Regarding these three\ndebts, since there is no record evidence indicating that the three debts fall within the parameters of\nQuestions 38 and 39, the Administrative Judge had no factual or legal basis for finding Applicant\nfalsified the security clearance application by not listing such past due debts in response to Questions\n38 and 39.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 00-0250 at 4 (App. Bd. Jul. 11, 2001).    \nTo the extent that the Administrative Judge articulated a specific rationale in his decision for\nhis findings that Applicant falsified his security clearance application, he did so almost exclusively\non the basis of a negative assessment of Applicant\u2019s credibility. (Decision at p. 5).  However, where\nthe record evidence does not establish that Applicant was required to divulge the three debts on his\n\n6\nsecurity clearance questionnaire, a negative assessment of Applicant\u2019s credibility is irrelevant in\nestablishing that Applicant engaged in falsification regarding them.  The Board has long held that\nan Administrative Judge cannot use a credibility determination as a substitute for record evidence.\nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 96-0608 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 28, 1997).  Applicant is correct in asserting\nthat, in the absence of record evidence supporting a controverted SOR allegation, mere disbelief in\nan applicant\u2019s statements is an insufficient basis for the Administrative Judge to find the Applicant\nengaged in the conduct alleged.\nWith regard to the debts listed at subparagraphs 1.c. and 1.d. of the SOR, the landscape is\nsomewhat different.  According to the entries in the credit reports in evidence, these debts appear\nmuch older than the three debts previously discussed, and the credit reports indicate account\ndelinquencies combined with \u201clast activity\u201d dates that, unlike the other three debts, are many years\nin the past.  Moreover, in regard to the debt listed at subparagraph 1.d., Applicant acknowledged\nduring his hearing testimony that the debt arose in the 1980's and he hadn\u2019t paid on it since the\n1990's. (Tr. At p. 31). Given the state of the record, the Board determines that, with regard to the\ndebts listed in subparagraphs 1.c. and 1.d., there is some evidence from which the Administrative\nJudge could reasonably infer that the debt delinquencies included 180 and 90 time periods, and\nconsequently could find that Applicant\u2019s \u201cno\u201d answers to Questions 38 and 39 were incorrect.  Such\na finding would not, however, be dispositive of the issue of Applicant\u2019s falsification since the mere\nproof of an omission or an incorrect answer, standing alone, does not establish or prove an\napplicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the omission or incorrect response occurred.  See, e.g., ISCR\nCase No. 02-23133 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004).  For a finding of falsification to be sustainable, the\nJudge would still have to make findings about Applicant\u2019s culpable state of mind that are reasonably\nsupported by the record evidence.\nNotwithstanding the fact that there is record evidence that could support a finding that\nApplicant was required to report the subparagraph 1.c. and 1.d. debts on his security clearance\napplication, the Board will not affirm the Administrative Judge\u2019s overall finding of falsification on\nthe basis of the record evidence regarding these two debts.  We decline to do so for the following\nreasons: (i) as indicated in preceding paragraphs, the Judge\u2019s finding of falsification contained no\ndescription or analysis of the status of the five debts on October 13, 2003, the components of\nQuestion 38 and 39, and no discussion of the issue of whether Applicant was required to report them;\n(ii) the Judge\u2019s finding of falsification contained no comprehensive description or analysis of\nApplicant\u2019s state of mind on October 13, 2003 when he completed the application; (iii) the finding\nof falsification relies too heavily (indeed, almost exclusively) on the Judge\u2019s negative assessment\nof Applicant\u2019s credibility which is, in turn, based upon the Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant\u2019s\nexplanations as to why he completed the security clearance application the way he did were not\npersuasive (it should be remembered that Applicant\u2019s explanations do not address any of the debts\nspecifically and fall short of being an admission that he was required to answer Questions 38 and 39\nin the affirmative); and (iv) the Judge\u2019s ultimate finding of falsification assumes that Applicant lied\nas to all five debts listed in the SOR and his negative credibility assessment is based upon that\nassumption\u2013 in other words, the Judge assessed the number and dollar amount of Applicant\u2019s debts\n\nThe Board\u2019s assertion here is based on the following paragraph from the Conclusions section of the Judge\u2019s\n5\ndecision: \u201cApplicant\u2019s explanations are not persuasive.  Considering the dollar size and nature of the delinquent debts,\nApplicant\u2019s explanations and excuses are simply not credible and do not come close to outweighing the substantial and\nobjective evidence supporting the SOR\u2019s financial-related allegations.\u201d  While this portion of the Judge\u2019s decision is not\na model of clarity, it appears that he is assessing Applicant\u2019s credibility and denials of falsification with reference to an\nundivided whole of debt evidence.  The Board cannot sustain any portion of the Judge\u2019s falsification finding under such\ncircumstances after it has ruled that there is no basis for the Judge\u2019s finding of falsification regarding three of the five\ndebts alleged.  \n7\nin the aggregate and then concluded that Applicant\u2019s explanations were not plausible in the face of\nthe totality of this evidence.  \n5\n(b) Applicant asserts on appeal that there is no record evidence that Applicant had knowledge\nof the five overdue debts on October 13, 2003.  Given the Board\u2019s ruling that there is no basis for\nthe Administrative Judge to find falsification regarding the subparagraph 1.a.,1.b., and 1.e. debts\nbecause of a lack of evidence that the debts were actually 90 or 180 days overdue, the issue of\nApplicant\u2019s knowledge of them is essentially moot.  Regarding the subparagraph 1.c. and 1.d. debts,\nApplicant\u2019s argument that there is no evidence that could establish Applicant\u2019s knowledge of them\nis incorrect.  The issue of Applicant\u2019s knowledge is an issue of Applicant\u2019s state of mind.\nApplicant\u2019s denials of any intent to falsify the October 13, 2003 security clearance application are\nrelevant evidence that the Judge, on remand, will be required to consider.  However, Applicant\u2019s\nstatements about his intent or state of mind are not binding or conclusive on the Judge.  As a\npractical matter, when an applicant denied that he or she engaged in falsification, proof of the\napplicant\u2019s intent or state of mind is rarely based on direct evidence, but often must rely on\ncircumstantial evidence.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-15935 at 6 (App. Bd. Oct. 15, 2003).  It is not\nmere speculation or surmise for a Judge to make a finding of fact about an applicant\u2019s intent or state\nof mind based on circumstantial evidence.  To the contrary it is legally permissible for a Judge to\nmake a finding of falsification based on circumstantial evidence of an applicant\u2019s intent or state of\nmind. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 00-0601 at pp. 2-3 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2001); ISCR Case No. 99-\n0194 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 29. 2000).  See also Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, 6  edition (West Publishing,\nth\n1990) at p. 810 (noting that intent is \u201c[a] mental attitude which can seldom be proved by direct\nevidence, but must ordinarily be proved by circumstances from which it may be inferred\u201d).  After\na review of the record evidence in the case, the Board declines to rule that, as a matter of law, there\nis insufficient evidence upon which the Judge can make inferences about Applicant\u2019s state of mind\nconcerning the two remaining debts at the time he completed the security clearance application.\nGiven the Board\u2019s rulings in this case, remand of the case to the Administrative Judge is the\nappropriate disposition.  On remand, the Administrative Judge should restrict his inquiry to evidence\nof falsification only as it relates to the debts alleged in subparagraphs 1.c. and 1.d. of the SOR.  In\nso doing, the Judge should reassess the evidence relating to Applicant\u2019s state of mind and the Judge\nshould also reassess Applicant\u2019s credibility as it relates to alleged falsification of the remaining\ndebts. \n   \nWhether the Record Supports the Administrative Judge\u2019s Ultimate Conclusions\nAn Administrative Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a\nsatisfactory explanation for\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found\nand the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

Newman, Esquire\nKalijarvi, Chuzi, & Newman\n\n-2-\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant had five delinquent debts that have now been paid off or are being resolved.  On\nhis security clearance application (SF 86), Applicant answered \u201cNo\u201d to two debt-related questions\nand did not mention of the debts.  As to three debts, the record does not establish they were\ndelinquent when he signed the SF 86.  As to two other debts, Applicant\u2019s explanations are supported\nby sufficient evidence so that mitigation has been adequately established.  Clearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn July 29, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2,\n1992, as amended, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant.  The SOR detailed reasons\nwhy DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding required under the Directive that it\nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant.  The SOR recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to conduct proceedings and\ndetermine whether a clearance should be granted, denied or revoked.\nOn August 22, 2005, Applicant responded to the allegations set forth in the SOR, and elected\nto have a decision made by a DOHA Administrative Judge after a hearing.  The matter was assigned\nto me on October 21, 2005.  On February 10, 2006, a Notice of Hearing was issued, setting the\nhearing for March 7, 2006.  At the hearing, the Government introduced five (5) exhibits, which were\nmarked as Government\u2019s Exhibits (GX) 1-5.  Applicant testified and introduced seven (7) exhibits,\nwhich were marked as Applicants Exhibits (AX) A-G.  A timely post hearing submission was also\nreceived (AX H).  The transcript was received on March 15, 2006. \nOn March 12, 2007, the Appeal Board issued a Decision remanding the case to this\nAdministrative Judge, with instructions to issue a new decision taking into account the Appeal\nBoard\u2019s findings and directions.  As the Appeal Board stated, at page 2: \u201cDepartment Counsel did\nnot appeal  the Judge\u2019s favorable ruling regarding the underlying debts [i.e., 1.a.-1e].  Therefore, it\nis necessary to recite the facts concerning Applicant\u2019s indebtedness only insofar as they relate to the\nfalsification issues that form the basis for this appeal.\u201d  In compliance with the Remand order, I have\nreevaluated the evidence in the case file and issued this Decision on Remand.   \n     \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant is a 36-year-old employee of a defense contractor.  The SOR contains five (5)\nallegations under Guideline F (Financial) and two allegations under Guideline E (Personal Conduct).\nApplicant admits allegations 1.a., 1.c., and 1.e, and denies 1.b. and 1.d.  He also denies allegations\n2.a and 2.b.  All admissions are accepted and incorporated herein as Findings of Fact.  \n\n-3-\nAfter considering the totality of the evidence, I make the following additional FINDINGS\nOF FACT as to the status of each SOR allegation.\nGuideline F (Financial) \nApplicant has a history of five (5) past due debts (delinquent, charged off, referred for\ncollection, or reduced to judgment) to the following creditors in the approximate amounts cited:\n1.a. - Creditor A ----------------------$1,507.00.  The debt amount has been reduced to\n$307.42, as of March 11, 2006 and is now current (AX H4);\n1.b. - Medical Provider B ---------------$80.00.  This debt has been paid off (AX C and Tr at\n20, 21);\n1.c. - Military Exchange C ----------- $413.00.  This debt has been paid off (AX H2);\n1.d. - Collection Agency D ---------$1,923.00.  Applicant has been in contact with this\ncreditor.  To his previous knowledge, the debt had been charged off (AX H).  Currently, he\nhas set up a payment plan to resolve this debt (Tr at 21). \n1.e. - Finance Company E ----------$14,108.00.  This car payment debt amount has been\nreduced to $12,182.05, and is being treated by the creditor as current, as of April 3, 2006\n(AX H5 and AX H6). \nGuideline E (Personal Conduct)\nApplicant did not knowingly falsify material facts on his October 13, 2003 security clearance\napplication (SCA) when he responded as follows:\n2.a. - Question  38 Your Financial Delinquencies - 180Days [in the last seven years], when\nhe answered \u201cNo. \u201d\n2.a. - Question  39 Your Financial Delinquencies - 90Days [currently], when he answered\n\u201cNo.\u201d \nPOLICIES\nEach adjudicative decision must also include an assessment of nine generic factors relevant\nthe conduct, to include knowing participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6)\nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood\n\n-4-\nof continuation or recurrence (Directive, E.2.2.1., on page 16 of Enclosure 2).  I have considered all\nnine factors, individually and collectively, in reaching my overall conclusion.\nThe eligibility criteria established by Executive Order 10865 and DoD Directive 5220.6\nidentify personal characteristics and conduct that are reasonably related to the ultimate question of\nwhether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d for an individual to hold a security\nclearance.  An applicant\u2019s admission of the information in specific allegations relieves the\nGovernment of having to prove those allegations.  If specific allegations and/or information are\ndenied or  otherwise controverted by the applicant, the Government has the initial burden of proving\nthose  controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons.  \nIf the Government meets its burden (either by the Applicant\u2019s admissions or by other\nevidence) and proves conduct that creates security  concerns under the Directive, the burden of\npersuasion then shifts to the Applicant to present  evidence in refutation, extenuation or mitigation\nsufficient to demonstrate that, despite the existence of conduct that falls within specific criteria in\nthe Directive, it is nevertheless consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue\na security clearance for the Applicant.\nA person seeking access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the\nGovernment based upon trust and confidence.  As required by DoD Directive 5220.6, as amended,\nat E2.2.2., \u201cany doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with the\ninterests of national security will be resolved in favor of the nation\u2019s security.\u201d\nCONCLUSIONS\nGuideline F (Financial Conduct) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct)\n1.a - This debt of $1,507.00 arises from a student loan account (two credit reports, GX 4 and\nGX 5).  The debt arose from studies by Applicant while he was away on active duty (Tr at 19).  On\nboth credit reports, the debt is listed as an unpaid collection account with a list date of March 2004\nand a last activity date of August 2003.  Applicant testified that he was on active duty in the Navy\nand understood that the Veterans Administration was paying off his education expenses.  By the time\nhe learned that the debt had not been paid under Navy allotments, he had been out of the service for\nseveral months.  It was later determined that the Government would no longer provide this benefit\nand the bills for his education benefits were then passed on to him. Applicant testified that he was\nnot  \u201caware of that fact until several months later and way after I did the background investigation\u201d\n(Tr at 19, 20).\nApplicant admits the debt, but claims the original amount of $1,507.00 has been reduced by\npayment(s) to $1,407.00 (AX A, last bill as of 08/15/2005, and AX B, receipt for $100 payment).\nHe has been paying on the debt since June 2005 (Tr at 20).  He promised that the debt would be paid\noff by December 2005 (Response to SOR).  The latest evidence shows that, as of March 11, 2006,\n\n-5-\nthe debt had been reduced to $307.42 (AX H3, H4).  \nApplicant\u2019s answers in his response to the SOR and the hearing testimony contain admissions\nof awareness of past due debts and general expressions of regret that he had not researched the matter\nbefore answering Questions 38 and 39 on his SF 86.  At the same time, he essentially denies that he\nhad any arrearage that fell within the parameters of the two questions and he does not reference any\nof the specific debts cited in the SOR.  And, as stated in the Appeal Board\u2019s Decision: \u201cThe record\ndoes not conclusively establish that the debt cited in 1.a. was 180 days delinquent during the seven\nyears period prior to October 13, 2003, or was 90 days delinquent on the date Applicant completed\nhis SF 86.\u201d \nBased on the Appeal Board\u2019s guidance, I conclude that Applicant\u2019s admissions do not\nnecessarily prove that he was required to report the debt under Questions 38 and 39.  Applicant\u2019s\nstatements do not fill in the evidentiary gap that exists in the written record as to this debt, as well\nas to the debts cited in 1.b. and 1.e.  \n \n1.b. - Applicant acknowledges this debt of $80.00 to a medical provider (credit report of\nJune 2005, GX 4, and credit report of September 2005, GX 5), but claimed he had forwarded the\ndebt to an insurance company he claimed should/would pay the debt (Response to SOR).  He was\nawaiting notice of such a payoff, at which time he would notify the credit reporting service to\ncorrect and update his account. \nAs of October 13, 2003, the date Applicant completed the SF 86,  no other relevant evidence\nappears in the record.  In his testimony, Applicant introduced a monthly statement from the health\ncare provider, dated April 5, 2004 (AX C).  The bill stated that Applicant owed $80.44, but that the\naccount was \u201ccurrent\u201d as of that date.  The bill also indicated that it was for goods and services\nprovided in March 2004,  which was some five months after Applicant competed the SF 86 in\nOctober 2003.  Prior to the hearing, Applicant sent the creditor a check for $80.44 (AX C and Tr\nat 20, 21), so that this debt is no longer owing.\n1.c. - This debt of $413.00 is to a military exchange (credit reports of June 6, 2005, GX 4,\nand September 12, 2005, GX 5).  The June 6, 2005 credit report indicates that the account was\nopened in 1993, the credit information was reported in April 2005, wherein an amount of $222.00\nwas reported as delinquent, with the last account activity being in 1999.  Both credit reports state\nthat the account was closed at Applicant\u2019s  request on an unspecified date.  Applicant admitted the\nexistence of the debt in his response to the SOR, but did not mention the date of origin or\ndelinquency history.  Applicant made a partial payment in August 2005 (AX D).  At the hearing,\nApplicant testified that he paid off the debt at some unspecified date and that the debt was then 30\ndays delinquent (Tr at 21).  Applicant\u2019s post hearing exhibits confirm that the debt was paid off in\nApril 2006  (Tr at 21, AX H1 and AX H2).   \n1.d. - In his SOR, Applicant stated that he denied any knowledge of this debt of $1,923.00,\nand had begun an investigation to discover the truth.  On November 23, 2003, he sent a letter to the\n\n-6-\ncredit reporting service, disputing the debt and asking for an investigation and response (AX E and\nAX F).  As stated in the Appeal Board\u2019s Decision, the first of two credit reports, dated June 6, 2005\n(GX 4) states the debt amount as $222.00, and the second, of September 12, 2005 (GX 5), and both\ngive the year of  last account activity as 1999. At first, Applicant did not think this debt was his\n(Answer to SOR), but he came to realize this is his debt, just one that originated under another\ncreditor\u2019s name (Tr at 21).  He has set up a payment plan to resolve the outstanding debt (Id.).  The\n2004 credit report (GX 3) cites the debt as being \u201ccurrent\u201d and contains the notation \u201cpays as\nagreed.\u201d  The two 2005 credit reports (GX 4 and 5) indicate that as of then, the account had fallen\ninto arrears and the vehicle had been repossessed.  Since the SF 86 was completed in October 2003,\nthe record evidence does not show that the debt was delinquent at that time, nor that Applicant had\nany reason to believe it to be so.   \n1.e. - Applicant admits this debt of $14,108.00 (auto repossession), which he claims has\nbeen reduced to $13,821.00 and has become current.  He also claims that the auto loan was\nreinstated, after some confusion caused by his mother was straightened out.  In any case, he is now\ncurrent and making monthly payments (Response to the SOR).  He has submitted a statement from\nthe creditor, dated \u201c08/24/2005,\u201d showing a $454.00 payment on \u201c07/29/2005\" and a balance due\nof $13,821.15 (AX G).  As is the case with SOR 1.a and 1.b., the Appeal Board has concluded that\nthere is no record evidence indicating that the debt was \u201chistorically delinquent\u201d (180 days within\nin the seven years prior to completion of the SF 86, nor 90 days prior to the date of completion of\nthe SF 86). \nSince Department Counsel did not appeal my previous  Decision\u2019s favorable findings and\nconclusions under Guideline F (Financial Considerations), the remaining issue is to evaluate the\nevidence under:  \nGuideline E (Personal Conduct)\nAs to three of the falsifications alleged in SOR, 1.a., 1.b., and 1.e., \u201cthere is no record\nevidence that these debts were historically (within seven years) 180 days delinquent or were 90 days\ndelinquent at the time Applicant completed his answers to Questions 38 and 39\u201d (Appeal Board\nDecision at page 5).  -The remaining unresolved issue pertains to SOR 1.c. and 1.d.  The issue to be\ndecided is two-fold; (1) whether Applicant was required to cite the debts alleged under SOR 1.c. and\n1.d.; and if so, whether his failure to do so was deliberate.\n2.a. and 2.b. - Applicant\u2019s overall explanation for not citing the debts alleged under 1.a. -\n1.e. is that he \u201chonestly does not recall being that late for that length of time (Response to SOR). \nHis explanation at the hearing was that he was in the second day of his new job, he had already\nhad a clearance for about 10 years, and he was just trying to get it done as quickly as possible. \nHe \u201coversighted\u201d these questions and didn\u2019t take the time to research them (Tr at 23).  The last\ntime he had looked at his credit report was in 1995 (Tr at 29).\nAs noted above, the debts cited in SOR 1.a., 1.b., and 1.e., have not been shown to have been\ndelinquent at the time the SF 86 was completed in October 2003, to the extent they were required\n\n-7-\nto have been reported in response to Questions 38 and 39.  Therefore, the issue of Applicant\u2019s state\nof mind does nor arise.\nAs to the debts cited in SOR 1.c. and 1.d., there is some evidence showing they were\ndelinquent, as that term is used in Questions 38 and 39 (Appeal Board Decision at page 6), but the\nissue remains as to whether Applicant knew of the delinquency and deliberately omitted any mention\nof these two debts only, not the five discussed in the original decision.  The clarity provided in the\nAppeal Board Decision, as discussed above under 1.c. and 1.d., leads me to conclude that it has not\nbeen definitively established that Applicant actually knew the two debts were delinquent and should\nhave been reported at the time he completed the SF 86 and answered \u201cNo\u201d to Questions 38 and 39.\nIn particular, the 2004 credit report (GX 3) cites the debt as being \u201ccurrent\u201d and contains the\nnotation \u201cpays as agreed.\u201d  The two 2005 credit reports (GX 4 and 5) indicate that as of then, the\naccount had fallen into arrears and the vehicle had been repossessed.  Since the SF 86 was completed\nin October 2003, the record does not show that the debt was delinquent at that time, nor that\nApplicant had any reason to believe it was delinquent.  \nThe stated Guideline E concern is that conduct involving questionable judgment,\nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules\nand regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information. \nDisqualifying Conditions: None that are established by the record.  As discussed above, the\nrecord evidence does not definitively establish that Applicant intentionally falsified his answers as\nto Questions 38 and 39, as to any of the five debts alleged in paragraph 1 of the SOR.\nIn summary, as to the financial allegations, the Government\u2019s financial concerns have been\nmitigated and, as to the Personal Conduct allegations, the Government has not established that\nApplicant falsified his answers to Questions 38 or 39 as to any of the five debts alleged under\nGuideline F.  The overall record compels a conclusion that Applicant presently possesses the good\njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness required of anyone seeking access to the nation\u2019s secrets.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings as required by Section 3, Paragraph 7 of Enclosure 1 of the Directive are\nhereby rendered as follows:\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) \n \nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph  l.a.           \nFor the Applicant\n                \nSubparagraph 1.b.               \nFor the Applicant\n            \nSubparagraph 1.c.           \nFor the Applicant\n           \nSubparagraph 1.d.            \nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph l.e.           \nFor the Applicant\n\n-8-\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct)\nFor the Applicant\n                \nSubparagraph 2.a.               \nFor the Applicant\n            \nSubparagraph 2.b            \nFor the Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nBARRY M.

On February 23, 2006 DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant\nof the basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement), and\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) pursuant to Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992,\nas amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On January 9, 2007 Administrative Judge\nCharles D. Ablard granted Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Department Counsel timely\nappealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.  \nIn the SOR, the government alleged that Applicant falsified material facts on a September\n28, 2005 interrogatory response by answering \u201cno\u201d to a question asking whether he had ever used\nillegal drugs, including marijuana.  The SOR also alleged that Applicant falsified material facts on\nan interrogatory response dated November 4, 2005 when the interrogatory asked him to provide an\nexplanation regarding a discrepancy between a medical record dating from August 2004 where\nApplicant indicated he used marijuana on weekends and his \u201cno\u201d answer to the drug question on the\nSeptember 28, 2005 interrogatory.  The alleged falsification took place when Applicant explained\nthe discrepancy by stating he had never taken illegal drugs and he lied to a staff member at the\nhospital in September 2005 in order to get individual counseling.  In his decision, the Administrative\nJudge concluded that Applicant had not falsified his responses to these two interrogatory questions.\nDepartment Counsel raised the following issues on appeal:  whether the Administrative\nJudge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant did not intentionally falsify his answers on two interrogatory\nResponses executed on September 28, 2005 and November 4, 2005 is supported by the record\nevidence.  We reverse the Administrative Judge\u2019s decision to grant the clearance. \nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Factual Findings\nA. Facts \nThe Judge made the following factual findings: (a) Applicant grieved over the death of his\ndaughter in July 2004; (b) Applicant became severely depressed as a result of her death and had\ncontinuing thoughts of suicide; (c) Applicant was admitted to mental hospital on August 5, 2004;\n(d) the hospital recommended he be transferred to a psychiatric facility some 95 miles away; (e)\nApplicant\u2019s wife drove him there; (f) on the day of Applicant\u2019s admission, August 6, 2004, he tested\npositive for marijuana; (g) Applicant was interviewed first by a psychiatrist on August 7, 2004 and\ntwo days later by a social worker; (h) the medical report signed by the doctor indicated that Applicant\nhad stated that he \u201cprobably\u201d used marijuana on weekends; (I) Applicant made this statement to the\nsocial worker during an interview with her in an effort to receive individual counseling and better\ntherapy than he was getting in group sessions; (j) the statement about marijuana use was a\nmisrepresentation made for treatment purposes; (k) during his security clearance investigation in\n2005, Applicant was first appraised by the Defense Security Service of the results of the marijuana\ntesting in 2004; (l) initially, Applicant believed the test results had been mixed up with another\npatient, since he had not used marijuana; (m) Applicant later surmised that the positive test for\nmarijuana resulted from the fact that his wife had smoked 2-4 joints of marijuana in the closed cab\nof their truck during the 95 mile drive from the mental hospital to the psychiatric facility on August\n6, 2004; (n) Applicant had not used marijuana; (o) two interrogatories were taken of Applicant; (p)\nin the response to the first on September 28, 2005, he denied any use of marijuana; (q) in the second,\ndated November 4, 2005, he was asked to explain the inconsistency in his earlier interrogatory and\n\nThe Judge\u2019s favorable findings and conclusions with regard to Guideline H were not challenged by Department\n1\nCounsel on appeal.  However, it should be noted that the Judge\u2019s findings and conclusions under Guideline H contain\ninconsistencies which are pertinent to the issues on appeal.  In his findings, the Judge states that Applicant has not used\nmarijuana, at least not on the occasion that Applicant theorizes caused his drug test to indicate positive (the Judge makes\nno finding as to whether Applicant used drugs on other occasions).  In his conclusions section, the Judge states that\nApplicant testified credibly that he was not a user of illegal drugs, then inexplicably concludes that the drug use\nallegations have been mitigated as an isolated and aberrational event.  In her appeal brief, Department Counsel indicates\nthat the decision not to appeal the Judge\u2019s favorable findings and conclusions under Guideline H were based on the\nJudge\u2019s conclusion that the drug use had been mitigated.  Thus, for purposes of this appeal, notwithstanding the decision\nnot to contest the Judge\u2019s ultimate resolution of Guideline H, Department Counsel has not conceded those portions of\nthe Judge\u2019s Decision wherein the Judge states that Applicant did not use marijuana.  Indeed, Department Counsel\u2019s\nappeal of the Judge\u2019s resolution of the Guideline E allegations is obviously predicated on a rejection of the Judge\u2019s\nfinding that Applicant did not use marijuana.  The Judge\u2019s conclusion that the drug use allegations under Guideline H\nwere mitigated as an isolated an aberrational event does not coexist logically with the Judge\u2019s implicit conclusion under\nGuideline E that Applicant never used drugs.  The discrepancy is reflective of an arbitrary and capricious analysis on\nthe part of the Judge.    \n3\nhis statement at the hospital admitting to use of marijuana; (r) he answered that his reason for so\nstating to the hospital was to obtain individual counseling; (s) in the second interrogatory, he again\ndenied use of any illegal drug; (t) Applicant is highly regarded by his company, his supervisor, and\nby his colleagues who testified on his behalf; (u) none of the witnesses have ever suspected any drug\nuse by Applicant; (v) and, one witness, a friend of Applicant for over 30 years, testified that he is the\n\u201cmost honest person I know\u201d with a \u201cflawless\u201d reputation for honesty.      \n1\n  \nB. Discussion\nThe Appeal Board\u2019s review of the Administrative Judge\u2019s findings of fact is limited to\ndetermining if they are supported by substantial record evidence\u2014such relevant evidence as a\nreasonable mind might accept as adequate to support such a conclusion in light of all the contrary\nevidence in the record.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the\nevidence, and the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not\nprevent an administrative agency\u2019s finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d  Consolo\nv. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620-21 (1966).  In evaluating the Administrative\nJudge\u2019s findings, we are required to give deference to the Administrative Judge\u2019s credibility\ndeterminations.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1. \nThe Administrative Judge\u2019s resolution of the issue of whether Applicant engaged in\ndeliberate falsification, although it could easily be analyzed as a finding of fact, is couched in terms\nof the Judge\u2019s conclusions.  No other findings of fact are challenged on appeal.  Therefore, the\nappeal issue in this case can be resolved with reference to the Judge\u2019s conclusions, which are\ndescribed in the following paragraph.\n  \nWhether the Record Supports the Administrative Judge\u2019s Ultimate Conclusions\nThe Judge reached the following conclusions regarding the alleged falsifications by\nApplicant: (I) the testimony of Applicant as well as the evidence offered by the government is\nunclear; (ii) no evidence was offered on either side as to the likelihood or possibility that his theory\n\n4\nof ingestion of second hand smoke might have been possible; (iii) the mental condition of Applicant\nduring the hospitalization makes it difficult to evaluate his behavior and his reasons for it during his\nhospitalization; (iv) the government allegations under Guideline E alleged in the SOR are rebutted\nsince the statements cited and attributed to Applicant on his two interrogatory answers were not\ndeliberate falsifications as required by the guideline; (v) Applicant\u2019s explanations are credible; (vi)\nApplicant has a reputation for honesty among his colleagues and friends who testified for him; (vii)\nwhile there are certain inconsistencies ans questions about accuracy of some of the events and their\nsequence when he was hospitalized and distraught from the family tragedy, the security concerns\nhave been mitigated by the testimony of Applicant and his witnesses.\n   \nAn Administrative Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a\nsatisfactory explanation for\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found\nand the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins.\nCo., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983) (quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156,\n168 (1962)).  The Appeal Board may reverse the Administrative Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or\nrevoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.3.\nWe review matters of law de novo.\nOn appeal, Department Counsel asserts that the Administrative Judge\u2019s conclusion that\nApplicant did not falsify his responses to the two interrogatories is not supported by the record\nevidence and is therefore arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law.  Department Counsel\u2019s argument\nhas merit.  \nMore specifically, Department Counsel contends: (a); the Judge substituted an implausible\ncredibility determination for record evidence; (b) the Judge\u2019s decision dismisses direct and\ncircumstantial evidence of Applicant\u2019s intent to falsify his responses to the two sets of\ninterrogatories; and (c) the evidence establishing Applicant\u2019s drug use and falsifications is\noverwhelming when compared to Applicant\u2019s self-serving and inconsistent explanations for his\nconduct.  These arguments are persuasive.  \nIt is well established in industrial security clearance cases that the question of whether there\nis sufficient evidence to support a Judge\u2019s factual findings is a matter of law, not one of fact. See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 94-0964 at 3 (App. Bd. July 3, 1996).  The deference afforded a trier of fact is\nnot absolute. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 95-0178 at 2-4 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 1996).\nThe Judge\u2019s finding and conclusion that Applicant did not deliberately falsify his responses\nabout marijuana use on the interrogatories is based on the Judge\u2019s acceptance of Applicant\u2019s\nexplanation for his answers.  Applicant\u2019s denials of any intention to falsify and his explanation for\nwhy he answered the interrogatories the way he did are relevant and material evidence.  However,\nApplicant\u2019s denials and explanations are not conclusive evidence.  Rather, Applicant\u2019s statements,\nwhether written or in the form of hearing testimony, had to be considered in light of the record\nevidence as a whole.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 98-0620 at 2 (App. Bd. June 22, 1999).  An intent\nto falsify can be shown by circumstantial evidence even in the face of denials of any intent to falsify.\nSee, e.g., DISCR Case No. 90-0770 at 3 (App. Bd. July 16, 1992); Cf. Foster v. Dalton, 71 F.3d 52,\n56 (1st Cir. 1995) (\u201cNotwithstanding a person\u2019s disclaimers, a contrary state of mind may be inferred\nfrom what he does and from a factual mosaic tending to show that he really meant to accomplish\nwhat he professes not to have intended.\u201d)(quoting earlier decision).  Even though the Judge\u2019s\n\nDecision at 5.\n2\n5\nacceptance of Applicant\u2019s explanation is based on his favorable assessment of Applicant\u2019s\ncredibility, that does not end the analysis.\nThe deference owed to an Administrative Judge\u2019s credibility determinations (Directive,\nAdditional Procedural Guidance, Item 32.a) does not immunize them from review, nor does it\npreclude the Board from concluding that a challenged credibility determination cannot be sustained.\nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 97-0356 at 3 (App. Bd. April 21, 1998); ISCR Case No. 95-0178 at 2-3\n(App. Bd. Mar. 29, 1996).  The record evidence in this case demonstrates the kind of situation the\nSupreme Court discussed in Anderson v. City of Bessemer, 470 U.S. 564, 575 (1985): \u201c[T]he trial\njudge may [not] insulate his findings from review by denominating them credibility determinations,\nfor factors other than demeanor and inflection go into the decision whether or not to believe a\nwitness. Documents or objective evidence may contradict the witness\u2019 story; or the story itself may\nbe so internally inconsistent or implausible on its face that a reasonable fact finder would  not credit\nit.  Where such factors are present, the courts of appeals may well find clear error even in a finding\npurportedly based on a credibility determination.\u201d\nThere is record evidence in this case that strongly undercuts the Judge\u2019s favorable credibility\ndetermination.  The Judge made a finding of fact that Applicant misrepresented the nature of his drug\nuse (supposedly admitting drug use that he never engaged in) to health care providers during intake\ninterviews in August 2004.  The Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant did not falsify answers on his\ninterrogatories is wholly based on the Judge\u2019s theory that Applicant engaged in falsehoods to obtain\na desired result at an earlier time.  The Judge\u2019s decision is silent as to how Applicant\u2019s history of\nlying to obtain a desired level of medical treatment is compatible with a favorable credibility\nassessment.  Such a history of falsehoods is powerful evidence that runs counter to any suggestion\nthat Applicant has demonstrated honesty and trustworthiness.  Additionally, the Judge\u2019s favorable\ncredibility determination does not take into account the fact that Applicant offered two inconsistent\nexplanations as to why the drug test administered by the hospital in 2004 yielded a positive result\nfor the ingestion of marijuana.  In his findings of fact, the Judge stated uncritically that Applicant\nat one point believed the drug test results had been mixed up with those of another patient and later\nsurmised that the positive test for marijuana resulted from the fact that his wife had smoked 2-4\njoints of marijuana while they drove in the closed truck cab on August 6, 2004.  Once again, the\nJudge\u2019s decision is silent as to how the proffering of inconsistent explanations for a positive drug\ntest is compatible with a favorable credibility assessment.  There is nothing in the Judge\u2019s decision\nto suggest that he doubted or rejected either of these conflicting explanations.  Indeed, when\nconcluding that Applicant had not falsified his responses to the interrogatories, the Judge stated, \u201cI\nfound his explanations credible.\u201d   No deference is owed to a favorable credibility determination that\n2\nresults in acceptance of an applicant\u2019s explanations that are inconsistent and incompatible.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 00-0713 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2002).  The Judge\u2019s favorable credibility\ndetermination is not sustainable.  An overall review of the Judge\u2019s decision convinces the Board that\nhis resolution of the issues under Guideline E is largely based upon this credibility determination.\nAn Administrative Judge is not required to accept testimony merely because it is unrebutted.\nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 99-0005 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 19, 2000).  Indeed, it would be arbitrary and\ncapricious for a Judge to uncritically accept a witness\u2019s testimony without considering whether it is\nplausible and consistent with other record evidence.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 00-0620 at 3 (App.\n\nWhen discussing the \u201ctruck cab\u201d incident during his hearing testimony, Applicant did not indicate that he\n3\nobjected at any time to his wife\u2019s smoking of marijuana. \n6\nBd. Oct. 19, 2001).  Accordingly, whether to accept an applicant\u2019s explanation about a matter cannot\nsimply turn on a Judge\u2019s assessment of the applicant\u2019s demeanor when the applicant testifies.\nFurthermore, a Judge\u2019s acceptance of an applicant\u2019s explanation for his or her conduct must be based\non a reasonable interpretation of the record evidence as a whole.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 99-0710\nat 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 19, 2001); ISCR Case No. 99-0194 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 29, 2000).  In\ndetermining whether there is sufficient record evidence to support a Judge\u2019s findings, the Board will\nconsider not just whether there is record evidence consistent with the Judge\u2019s findings, but will also\nconsider whether there is evidence that detracts from the Judge\u2019s findings.  See Directive, Additional\nProcedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.1.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 99-0205 at 2 (Oct. 19, 2000).\nThe Judge\u2019s acceptance of Applicant\u2019s explanation for his omissions of marijuana use from\nthe interrogatories cannot be sustained because it does not reflect a reasonable, plausible\ninterpretation of the record evidence as a whole.  Applicant\u2019s explanation for his omissions is\nimplausible when it is considered in light of the record evidence as a whole.\nThere are several matters reflected in the record of this case that, viewed in their entirety,\nundercut the plausibility of Applicant\u2019s explanation that he never knowingly or voluntarily used\nmarijuana and therefore never  lied about it in his interrogatory responses.  They are: (a) the positive\ndrug test itself; (b) Applicant\u2019s admissions of marijuana use, made contemporaneously with the\npositive drug test results, which strongly corroborate those test results; (c) Applicant\u2019s inconsistent\nexplanations for why he tested positive; (d) Applicant\u2019s insistence at the hearing that he did not tell\nthe doctor who interviewed him on August 7, 2004 about any drug use but only described drug use\nto a social worker during an interview on August 9, 2004 when the doctor\u2019s notes (dictated on\nAugust 7 and transcribed on August 8) clearly reflect Applicant\u2019s admission of drug use; (e)\nApplicant\u2019s speculative explanation during his hearing testimony that the doctor must have found\nout about his admissions of drug use after being told about them by the social worker when the\nchronology and dates of the documents prepared by the doctor and social worker (the social worker\u2019s\nhandwritten psychological assessment is dated August 9) make Applicant\u2019s hypothesis highly\nunlikely if not impossible; (f) the complete lack of record evidence as to why Applicant believed he\nhad to lie to hospital personnel about drug use in order to obtain individual counseling; (g) the fact\nthat Applicant did not mention lying about drug use to obtain individual counseling in a February\n2004 statement to a government investigator (which dealt with Applicant\u2019s 2004 mental health\ntreatment) or in the September 2004 set of interrogatories (which asked Applicant to discuss drug\nuse), but mentioned his admissions about drugs to hospital personnel only after being confronted\nwith those admissions in the November 2004 set of interrogatories; and (h) the fact that Applicant\u2019s\nwife has a history of marijuana use requiring counseling, and the fact that Applicant\u2019s wife testified\nthat she was smoking marijuana in the truck during the trip to the psychiatric facility on August 6,\n2004 in order to get her husband to relax by giving him a \u201ccontact high,\u201d a course of behavior that\nthe wife claims Applicant objected to, but which the record evidence indicates Applicant did nothing\nto stop;       \n3\nDepartment Counsel points out on appeal that the Judge commented in his decision that\nneither Department Counsel nor Applicant offered evidence at the hearing as to the likelihood or\npossibility that Applicant\u2019s theory of ingesting second-hand marijuana smoke was plausible.\n\n7\nDepartment Counsel argues that because the Judge ultimately accepted Applicant\u2019s position that the\npositive drug test was a result of the secondary ingestion of marijuana smoke, the Judge\u2019s statement\nabout the lack of evidence reveals that the Judge improperly shifted the burden to the government\nto refute or disprove Applicant\u2019s claim.  Department Counsel\u2019s argument has merit.  While the\nJudge\u2019s decision is not a model of clarity on this point, his acceptance of Applicant\u2019s explanation\nafter commenting on the lack of objective evidence that would tend either to support or refute \nApplicant\u2019s claim leads logically to the inference that the Judge concluded there was a failure of\nproof on the part of the government to overcome Applicant\u2019s uncorroborated testimony.  This was\nclear error.  Where Department Counsel has introduced evidence of a positive drug test coupled with\nApplicant\u2019s prior admissions of willful and voluntary drug use on numerous occasions, Applicant\nbears the burden of persuasion when attempting to demonstrate that he did not use drugs and that\nthe positive drug test resulted from a single, supposedly involuntary incident.   \nDepartment Counsel has met its burden of demonstrating errors that cumulatively warrant\nreversal.\n \n \n Order\nThe judgment of the Administrative Judge granting Applicant a clearance is REVERSED.\nSigned: Michael Y.

Billett\nAdministrative Judge\nMember, Appeal Board\nCONCURRING OPINION OF ADMINISTRATIVE JUDGE JAMES E. MOODY\nI concur with my colleagues that the Judge erred in his analysis of this case.  The crux of this\nappeal concerns allegations under Guideline E that Applicant had falsified answers to interrogatories\nposed to him as part of his security clearance investigation.  In one question Applicant was asked\n\u201cHave you ever used any...Cannabis (to include marijuana and hashish), except prescribed by a\nlicensed physician?\u201d  Applicant answered \u201cno\u201d to this question.  In another he was asked to explain\na statement he had made to a medical facility that he had used marijuana on weekends.  Applicant\nacknowledged making the statement but insisted that it was untrue.  He stated had made it to staff\n\nGovernment Exhibit 7 contains an assessment of Applicant\u2019s medical history upon his admission to the hospital,\n4\nprepared by an M.D. and based mostly upon \u201cinformation obtained from the patient.\u201d   Under \u201cPersonal Habits\u201d the\nassessment states \u201cHe smokes marijuana on the weekend.\u201d  Later  in the same exhibit, in a section entitled \u201cPsychosocial\nAssessment,\u201d prepared by a clinician, is a statement of the extent of Applicant\u2019s marijuana use:  \u201c1 joint (maybe) per\nweek.\u201d   \nApplicant\u2019s wife testified as follows: \u201cI drove us up there...And at the time I was smoking marijuana.  I smoked\n5\nseveral joints in the truck while we were going up there.  And it\u2019s a very small confined area, which anyone in there with\nme would get high too...I thought if I did that it would ease the pain of it all and help relax him.\u201d  Tr. at 49.  \nDecision at 5.  \n6\nSee Directive \u00b6  E3.1.15.

Dec. 30, 2002) (Under a substantial\n7\nevidence standard \u201ca Judge\u2019s findings must be based on more than a mere scintilla of evidence, but they can be based\nupon less than a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d) (internal citation omitted) \nFed.

Upon admission to the\nhospital, Applicant stated that \u201che \u2018probably\u2019 used marijuana on weekends.\u201d   Subsequent laboratory\n4\nanalysis of Applicant\u2019s urine yielded a positive result for marijuana.  The Judge noted that Applicant\nattributed the urinalysis results to a possible laboratory mistake or to passive inhalation, his wife\nhaving smoked marijuana in the car while taking Applicant to the hospital.5\nIn analyzing Applicant\u2019s case, the Judge did not identify any Guideline E disqualifying\ncondition which he believed to be raised by the evidence.  Rather, he concluded that Applicant\u2019s\nexplanations for his admission of drug use and the urinalysis result were credible.  Without explicitly\nsaying so, the Judge appears to have concluded that the Government did not meet its burden of\nproduction under Directive \u00b6  E3.1.14.  He went on to state, \u201cThe testimony of Applicant as well as\nthe evidence offered by the government is unclear.  No evidence was offered on either side as to the\nlikelihood or possibility that his theory of ingestion of second hand smoke might have been possible.\nThe mental condition of Applicant during the hospitalization makes it difficult to evaluate his\nbehavior and his reasons for it during his hospitalization.\u201d   \n6\n  Of course, if the Government fails to present substantial evidence to support the allegations,\nthere is nothing for an applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate, and, therefore, the case is\nresolved in the applicant\u2019s favor.   In this case, however, the Government presented Applicant\u2019s\n7\nadmission of drug use made for the purposes of obtaining medical treatment.  Standing alone this\nsort of evidence is sufficiently reliable that it constitutes an exception to the hearsay rule.   When\n8\ncorroborated by laboratory testing, this admission was more than sufficient to constitute substantial\nevidence that Applicant\u2019s answers to the interrogatories were false, thereby raising appropriate\ndisqualifying conditions and shifting to Applicant the burden of persuasion as to retaining his\n\nSee Directive   E2.A5.1.2.3.  \u201cDeliberately providing false or misleading information concerning relevant and\n9\nmaterial matters to an investigator, security official, competent medical authority, or other official representative in\nconnection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination...\u201d\n9\nsecurity clearance.   The Judge\u2019s failure properly to analyze the Government\u2019s evidence is clear\n9\nerror, one effect of which is reflected in the passage quoted above, in which the Judge resolves\nevidentiary insufficiencies to the detriment of the Government,  as if the Government rather than\nApplicant bore the burden of persuasion.\n    Given both the implausibility and inconsistency of Applicant\u2019s explanations for his\nadmission of drug use and his positive urinalysis, I conclude that he cannot reasonably be said to\nhave met his burden of persuasion that it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security\nfor him to have a security clearance.

Campbell, Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nB. Daniel Lynch, Attorney At Law\nSYNOPSIS\n\n2\nThe Applicant\u2019s brother is a government official in Afghanistan.   The Applicant has\nconsistent and regular contact with his brother and this raises  a security concern.  Clearance is\ndenied. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn October 31, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 (as amended), and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive),\ndated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed the\nreasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it\nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance\nshould be denied or revoked.\nThe Applicant responded to the SOR on November 27, 2005, and December 17, 2005,\nnotarized respectively on November 28, 2005 and December 19, 2005, and he requested a hearing\nbefore a DOHA Administrative Judge.  This case was assigned to the undersigned on January 23,\n2006.  A notice of hearing was issued on February 8, 2006, scheduling the hearing for March 9,\n2006.  At the hearing the Government presented six exhibits.  The Applicant presented eight exhibits\nand called six witnesses.  He also testified on his own behalf.  The official transcript (Tr.) was\nreceived on March 24, 2006.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the testimony\nand the exhibits.  The Applicant is 48 years of age and is divorced.  He is employed as an interpreter\nor linguist for a defense contractor.  He seeks a security clearance in connection with his employment\nin the defense industry.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline B - Foreign Influence).  The Government alleges in this paragraph that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he has foreign contacts that could create the potential\nfor foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.\nThe Applicant was born in Afghanistan.  After an invasion by a Russian Communist regime,\nin 1979, he left Afghanistan as a refugee and walked through the desert to Iran.  After four months\nin Iran, he purchased a fake passport, traveled to Turkey, and then to Germany.  He stayed in\nGermany for about nine months and then came to the United States in 1980.  He began working for\na restaurant where he worked for eighteen years.  In October 1993, he became a United States\ncitizen.  The Applicant is grateful to the United States for the freedom and opportunities it has given\nhim.    \n\n3\nThe Applicant has a brother who is a citizen and resident of Afghanistan.  He is a government\nofficial in Kabul, Afghanistan.  His brother has a degree in political science and law from a college\nin Afghanistan.  In 2002, he started working for the United Nations in Afghanistan, and it was not\nlong after that when he became a government official.  The Applicant is not certain whether the\nposition was a political appointment.       \n\n4\nIn 2002, the Applicant was hired by a defense contractor to work as an interpreter to assist\nthe United States Army in their mission in Afghanistan.  The Applicant worked in Afghanistan from\nDecember 2002 to April 2004.  The Applicant went to lunch and dinner with his brother on two\noccasions while he was working in Afghanistan.  Since the Applicant returned to the United States,\nthe Applicant\u2019s brother has visited him in the United States once every six or seven months.  The\nApplicant explained that his brother lived in the United States with a green card from 1979 until\n2002, when he returned to assist in the formation of the new government in Afghanistan.  His wife\nand daughter reside in the United States.\n  \nThe Applicant explained that sometimes while he is in Afghanistan he feels safe, other times\nhe does not.  He states that he feels that he is a real stranger there because the country has changed\nso much.   \nSix witnesses testified on behalf of the Applicant that include several long time family\nfriends and family members, all of whom have a very high respect for the Applicant.  The Applicant\nis considered to be a most considerate, kind, honest, reliable, and sound individual.       \nLetters of recommendation from his employer, professional colleagues and military personnel\nwho have worked with the Applicant in Afghanistan attest to his sound judgment, discretion,\nreliability and team efforts.  He has achieved a high level of respect as an interpreter.  They consider\nhim a great American and is highly recommended for a security clearance.  (See Applicant\u2019s Exhibits\nA, B, C, D, F, G and H). \nSeveral photographs of the Applicant and his coworkers in Afghanistan further demonstrate\nthe comradery between them.  (See Applicant\u2019s Exhibit E).    \nPOLICIES\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  Accordingly, the Department of\nDefense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992  Directive sets forth policy factors and conditions that could\nraise or mitigate a security concern; which must be given binding consideration in making security\nclearance determinations.  These factors should be followed in every case according to the pertinent\ncriterion.  However, the conditions are neither automatically determinative of the decision in any\ncase, nor can they supersede the Administrative Judge\u2019s reliance on her own common sense.\nBecause each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it cannot be\nassumed that these factors exhaust the realm of human experience, or apply equally in every  case.\nBased on the Findings of Fact set forth above, the factors most applicable to the evaluation of this\ncase are:\nForeign Influence\nA security risk may exist when an individual\u2019s immediate family, including cohabitants, and other\npersons to whom he or he may be bound by affection, influence, or obligation are: (1) not citizens\nof the United States or (2) may be subject to duress.  These situations could create the potential for\nforeign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.  Contacts with\ncitizens of other countries or financial interests in other countries are also relevant to security\n\n5\ndeterminations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or\npressure.\nCondition that could raise a security concern:\n1. An immediate family member, or person to whom the individual has close ties of affection\nor obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign country;\n3. relatives, cohabitants, or associates who are connected with any foreign government.\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17, in evaluating the\nrelevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should consider the following general\nfactors:\na.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances\nb.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation\n \nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne.  The voluntariness of participation\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes\ng.  The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\n \ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics and\nconduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question, posed in Section 2 of Executive Order\n10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request\nfor access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period\nof a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted upon the individual meeting\nthese personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number\nof variables known as the whole person concept.  Available, reliable information about the person,\npast and present, favorable and unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.   The\n\n6\nAdministrative Judge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence\nwhich is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in\nExecutive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms\nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the Applicant\nconcerned.\u201d\nThe Government must make out a case under Guideline B (foreign influence) that establishes\ndoubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.  While a rational connection, or\nnexus, must be shown between Applicant's adverse conduct and his ability to effectively safeguard\nclassified information, with respect to sufficiency of proof of a rational connection, objective or\ndirect evidence is not required.\nThen, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in refutation,\nexplanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past adverse conduct, is unlikely\nto be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for a security clearance.\nAn individual who demonstrates a foreign preference and has foreign connections may be\nprone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.\nThe mere possession of a foreign passport raises legitimate questions as to whether the Applicant\ncan be counted upon to place the interests of the United States paramount to that of another nation.\nThe Government must be able to place a high degree of confidence in a security clearance holder to\nabide by all security rules and regulations, at all times and in all places.\nCONCLUSIONS\nHaving considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal standards and\nfactors, and having assessed the Applicant's credibility based on the record, this Administrative\nJudge concludes that the Government has established its case as to all allegations in the SOR.  \nThere is strong mitigating evidence in this case.  The Applicant has achieved the American\ndream.  He has obtained his citizenship, is obviously well liked, very professional and has achieved\na high level of respect from his colleagues.  However, the Applicant has close ties with his brother\nwho is a high level government official in Afghanistan.  His brother is a government official in\nAfghanistan.  The Applicant\u2019s brother is closely connected with the Afghanistan government.  The\nApplicant and his brother have consistent and regular contact with each other whether in Afghanistan\nor in the United States.  This by itself raises an unacceptable risk.  Under Guideline B, Disqualifying\nConditions (1) An immediate family member, or person to whom the individual has close ties of\naffection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign country, and (3)  relatives,\ncohabitants, or associates who are connected with any foreign government applies.  Under the\nparticular facts of this case, none of the mitigating conditions are applicable.  The possibility of\nforeign influence exists that could create the potential for conduct resulting in the compromise of\nclassified information.  Not withstanding the fact that Afghanistan is a close ally of the United States,\ncurrent official policy does not allow me to grant this Applicant a security clearance.  I find that the\nApplicant is vulnerable to foreign influence under.  Accordingly, I find against the Applicant under\nGuideline B (Foreign Influence).\n\n7\nConsidering all the evidence, the Applicant has not met the mitigating conditions of\nGuideline B of the adjudicative guidelines set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive.  Accordingly,\nshe has not met her ultimate burden of persuasion under Guideline B.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as required by\nParagraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: Against the Applicant.\nSubparas.\n1.a.: Against the Applicant\n1.b.: Against the Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interests to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.\nDarlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n \n",

DOHA received the transcript on\nMay 31, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations except subparagraph 1.e and 2.a. I have\nincorporated these admissions into the findings of fact. In addition, I make the following findings\nof fact.\nApplicant is a 28-year-old single father with four pre-adolescent children. He has a high\nschool education. Since 2000, he has worked as a material coordinator for a defense contractor.\nIn 1998, Applicant worked in a department store. Late one night at the end of his shift, a\nsecurity guard checked his tote bag, and discovered some light bulbs for which he had not paid.\nApplicant was then arrested and charged with theft. The case was later nolle prossed.\nOn December 30, 2003, the police stopped Applicant and searched him. Although the search\nrevealed no illegal contraband, one of the police officers alleged that he saw him throw contraband\nto the ground upon being stopped. They searched the surrounding area and found 17 vials of cocaine\nin the grass.  Subsequently, he was arrested and charged with possession of controlled dangerous\n1\nsubstances.  At the hearing, the court deferred judgment, and placed him on probation for one year.\n2\n3\n\nExhibit 4 at 5.\n4\nExhibit 1, SF 86, dated July 23, 2004.\n5\nExhibit 2, Signed, Sworn Statement, dated November 23, 2004.\n6\nSee Applicant\u2019s Responses to Questions 24 and Question 20 (Your Employment Record) of the SF 86.\n7\nTr. 76.\n8\nTr. 28.\n9\nExhibit 4 at 1.\n10\n3\nOn July 10, 2004, while walking down the street late at night in a high crime area, Applicant\nwas stopped and searched by the police. There is no record evidence of what precipitated the police\nto stop him. Nevertheless, they found two vials of cocaine near him, and charged him with\npossession of controlled dangerous substances. On October 20, 2004, the court placed the case on\nits inactive, \u201cstet\u201d docket.4\nApplicant completed a security clearance application (SF 86) on July 23, 2004.  In response\n5\nto Question 24 (Your Police Record - Alcohol/Drug Offenses Have you ever been charged with or\nconvicted of any offense(s) related to alcohol or drugs? For this item, report information regardless\nof whether the record in your case has been sealed or otherwise stricken from the record), he\ndisclosed the July 2004 charge, which was pending at the time, but not the December 2003 charge.\nAt the hearing, Applicant testified that he omitted the earlier charge because it did not result in a\njudgment.  Applicant disclosed the other two charges on the SF -86, and described them in detail.\n6\n7\nAt some point between July and December 2004, Applicant decided to supplement his\nincome by selling drugs.  In December 2004, approximately one month after executing a signed,\n8\nsworn statement to an investigative agent, he was stopped by the police. At the time of the stop, he\nwas driving his car, and the stop was precipitated by a non-functioning brake light. The police found\nten vials of cocaine in a compartment on the driver\u2019s side door of the car.  Subsequently, Applicant\n9\nwas charged with possession of controlled dangerous substances. Later, the court placed the charge\non its inactive, stet docket.10\nPOLICIES\nThe adjudicative guidelines, as revised December 29, 2005, and implemented September 1,\n2006, apply to the analysis of this case. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each\nguideline, they are divided into those that may be considered in deciding whether to deny or revoke\nan individual\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information (disqualifying conditions) and those\nthat may be considered in deciding whether to grant an individual\u2019s eligibility for access to classified\ninformation (mitigating conditions).\nAn administrative judge need not view the adjudicative guidelines as inflexible  rules of law.\nInstead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines, when applied in\nconjunction with the factors set forth in the Adjudicative Process provision in Section E2.2.,\n\nSee Directive, Sec. 2.3, Sec. 2.5.3, Sec. 3.2, and Sec. 4.2.\n11\n4\nEnclosure 2, of the Directive, are intended to assist the administrative judge in reaching impartial,\ncommon sense decisions.\nBecause the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole-person concept,\u201d all available, reliable information about the person, past and present,\nfavorable and unfavorable, should be considered in making a meaningful decision. Specifically these\nare: (1) the nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances; (2) the frequency\nand recency of the conduct; (3) the age of the applicant; (4) the motivation of the applicant, and the\nextent to which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the\nconsequences; (5) the absence or presence of rehabilitation; and (6) the probability that the\ncircumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future.\nThe following adjudicative guidelines are raised:\nGuideline J - Criminal Conduct: Criminal activity creates doubt about\na person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very\nnature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness to\ncomply with laws, rules and regulations.\nGuideline E - Personal Conduct: Conduct involving questionable\njudgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply\nwith rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and\ncandid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nConditions pertaining to this adjudicative guideline that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security concerns, are set forth and discussed\nin the conclusions below.\nSince the protection of national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision\nin each case must be reached by applying the standard that the issuance of the clearance is \u201cclearly\nconsistent with the national interest.\u201d  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions\n11\nthat are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record.\nThe government is responsible for producing evidence to establish facts in the SOR that have\nbeen controverted. The applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by the government, and has the ultimate burden\nof persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nRefer to the Personal Conduct section of the Conclusions, infra.\n12\nApplicant stated he decided to deal drugs because his employer had cut his opportunities to work overtime.\n13\nAlso, he sought to emulate his cousin who always appeared to have money (Tr. 74).\n5\nCriminal Conduct\nApplicant was arrested four times between 1998 and 2004. At the time of the most recent\narrest, he was dealing drugs. Criminal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (CC DC) 31 (a): a single\nserious crime or multiple lesser offenses, and CC DC 31 (c): allegation or admission of criminal\nconduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted, or convicted,\napply.\nI have considered all of the mitigating conditions, and conclude none apply. Applicant\u2019s most\nrecent arrest occurred six months after the security clearance investigative process began, and one\nmonth after an agent had questioned him about his previous three arrests. Although his omission of\none of the arrests from the SF 86 does not constitute a felony falsification,  he has not mitigated the\n12\ncriminal conduct security concern.\nPersonal Conduct\nApplicant\u2019s omission of the December 2003 drug arrest from his SF 86 raises the issue of\nwhether Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) 16 (a): deliberate omission,\nconcealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal\nhistory statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness,\nor award fiduciary responsibilities, applies. He disclosed his other charges on the SF 86. One of\nthem occurred less than two weeks before he completed it. Moreover, he described them with\nlengthy narratives. Considering these facts, in conjunction with Applicant\u2019s education level, I\nconclude that he did not intend to falsify the SF 86, by omitting the December 2003 arrest.\nConsequently, there are no personal conduct concerns related to falsification of the SF 86 as alleged\nin SOR subparagraphs 1.e and 2.a.\nWhole Person Concept\nApplicant has not been arrested or charged with criminal conduct in more than two and a half\nyears. The last charge, however, occurred while the security clearance investigative process was\npending. I was particularly troubled by his nonchalant rationale for his decision to commit the crime\nleading to the arrest.  Consequently, considering the frequency of the conduct, and the absence of\n13\nrehabilitation, not enough time has elapsed to conclude that Applicant no longer poses a security\nrisk.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\n\n6\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1\u2013Guideline J:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2\u2013Guideline J\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. Clearance is denied.\nMarc E. Curry\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On September 21, 2005, DOHA issued a statement of reasons advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement) and\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct), of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On January 12, 2007, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge Martin H. Mogul granted Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nDepartment Counsel timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nBefore addressing the main appeal issues, the Board will discuss \u201calternative findings of fact\u201d\nthat were not made by the Administrative Judge, but are supported by the record evidence.  Although\nthe parties are free\u2013within the bounds of zealous advocacy\u2013to argue about what the record evidence\nshows, it is the Administrative Judge, not either party, that makes the findings of fact in a case.\nMoreover, the Directive authorizes the Board to review a Judge\u2019s findings of fact, not engage in de\nnovo fact-finding.   Accordingly, the Board will consider Department Counsel\u2019s proffered \u201cfindings\n1\nof fact\u201d only to the extent they constitute argument about the record evidence in support of any of\nthe specific appeal issues raised by Department Counsel.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-06174 at 3\n(App. Bd. Feb. 28, 2005).    \nDepartment Counsel raised the following issue: whether the Administrative Judge\u2019s\napplication of Guideline H Mitigating Condition (DIMC) 1  and DIMC 3  was arbitrary  and\n2\n3\ncapricious and not supported by the record evidence.    \n4\n \nThe record indicates that Applicant used marijuana with varying frequency between 1991 and\n2004.  Applicant also used psilocybin mushrooms between 1993 and 2003, but testified that he used\nthem only a few times.   In a signed, sworn statement dated November 18, 2004, Applicant stated\nthat he had last used marijuana in August 2004.  He stated that he now understood the impact that\ndrug use would have on his job and that he would no longer use marijuana or mushrooms.  \nThe Administrative Judge found that Applicant\u2019s drug use was mitigated due to the passage\nof time (DIMC 1) and Applicant\u2019s stated intention not to use illegal drugs in the future (DIMC 3).\nThe Judge stated that Applicant testified credibly that he had not used marijuana since he signed the\naffidavit in November 2004, over two years before the hearing.  Decision at 3.  The Judge based his\napplication of DIMC 3 in part on Applicant\u2019s statement that marijuana was not worth damaging his\ncareer and in part on changes in Applicant\u2019s life\u2013the fact that Applicant had since married and was\ncontemplating starting a family.\n\n3\nDepartment Counsel argues that  the Administrative Judge\u2019s application of DIMC 1 and\nDIMC 3 is not supported by record evidence and that the Judge substituted a credibility\ndetermination for record evidence in applying DIMC 3.  \nAs Department Counsel points out, the Board has declined to set a \u201cbright-line\u201d rule as to\nwhat constitutes recency under the Directive regarding drug use.  The Board has indicated that the\nmatter requires an Administrative Judge to evaluate the record evidence as a whole and reach\nreasonable conclusions as to the recency of an applicant\u2019s conduct.  Application of a mitigating\ncondition such as DIMC 1 can depend on a number of factors in addition to the simple passage of\ntime.  See, e.g.,ISCR Case No. 03-02374 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 26, 2006).  Here, in addition to the\npassage of time, the Judge noted changes in Applicant\u2019s life in support of his application of DIMC\n1.\nLikewise, the Administrative Judge stated reasons for his application of DIMC 3, beyond his\nconclusion that Applicant\u2019s testimony was credible.  He noted Applicant\u2019s written statement that he\nwould not use drugs because doing so would damage his career.  He also noted Applicant\u2019s marriage\nand contemplation of starting a family, as well as the testimony of Applicant\u2019s wife that Applicant\nhas forsworn the use of drugs.  Decision at 3.\nDepartment Counsel has not demonstrated error on the part of the Administrative Judge.  The\nBoard need not agree with the Judge\u2019s decision to sustain it.\nOrder\nThe Administrative Judge\u2019s favorable security clearance decision is AFFIRMED.\n   \nSigned: Michael Y.

While he furnished information to the United States Government in\na Security Clearance Application (SCA) that was incomplete, it was done inadvertently.  Mitigation\nhas been shown. Clearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn September 21, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 (as amended) and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated\nJanuary 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why\nDOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant and\nrecommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied\nor revoked.\nApplicant  filed a notarized response, dated October 5, 2005, to the allegations set forth in\nthe SOR, and requested a hearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge. \nThis case was assigned to this Administrative Judge on August 3, 2006, to conduct a hearing\nand issue a written decision. A Notice of Hearing was issued to the parties on November 22, 2006,\nand the hearing was conducted on December 12, 2006. \nAt the hearing, Department Counsel offered three documentary exhibits (Government\u2019s\nExhibits 1-3) and no witnesses were called. Applicant offered three documentary exhibits\n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A-C) and offered his testimony and that of his wife. The transcript (Tr) was\nreceived on December 20, 2006.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nIn the SOR, the Government alleges that a security risk may exist under Adjudicative\nGuideline H (Drug Involvement), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the Directive. The SOR\ncontains five allegations, 1.a. through 1.e., under Guideline H, and two allegations, 2.a. and 2.b.,\nunder Guideline E. Applicant admitted SOR allegations 1.a. through 1.e., and 2.a., and he denied 2.b.\nThe admitted allegations are incorporated herein as findings of fact. \nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including Applicant's\nAnswer to the SOR, the admitted documents, and the testimony of Applicant and his wife, and upon\ndue consideration of that evidence, I make the additional findings of fact: \nApplicant is 32 years old. He is married and has no children. Applicant has received a\nMasters Degree in Computer Science and a Bachelors Degree in Psychology. He is employed by a\ndefense contractor, and he seeks a DoD security clearance in connection with his employment in the\ndefense sector.\n\n3\nParagraph 1 (Guideline H - Drug Involvement) \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because\nhe has abused illegal substances. \nApplicant used marijuana from approximately 1991 to 2004.  The frequency of his use\nvaried, from as often as three to five times a week in 1993 and 1994, to four times a month during\n1994 to 1997, and in 1998 to 2000 he abstained completely. During the years 2001 to 2004 Applicant\ningested marijuana 2 or 3 times a year. He purchased some of the marijuana that he used from\nfriends. Applicant used marijuana after he completed a SCA on March 9, 2004, last using it on\nAugust 2004.\nApplicant also used psilocybin mushrooms, on approximately three to five occasions, from\n1993 to 2003. He also purchased some of the psilocybin mushrooms that he used. \nApplicant testified credibly that after he met with an investigator of the Office of Personnel\nManagement and signed an affidavit on November 18, 2004, he made a determination that he would\nnot use marijuana or any other illegal substance in the future. His reasoning for this decision\nincluded the fact that he is now married and he is contemplating starting a family. Also he feels that\nhis usage of marijuana is not worth damaging his career.   In his affidavit, he stated that he had no\nintention of using marijuana or mushrooms in the future. \nApplicant testified that since his decision to abstain completely from marijuana usage,  he\nhas been present where marijuana was being used and he was able to abstain from its usage without\nany difficulty. His wife also testified that Applicant has made a decision not to use marijuana in the\nfuture. \n \nFinally, Applicant submitted into evidence two Drug Screen Results Forms (Exhibits A and\nC) that indicate no illegal drugs were present in Applicant on December 8, 2006, and October 6,\n2005, the dates Applicant underwent drug testing.\nParagraph 2 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct) \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because\nhis conduct shows questionable judgement, untrustworthiness, unreliability, and lack of honesty.\nThis concern is based on Applicant using marijuana after completing a SCA, as discussed above, and\nallegedly knowingly furnishing incomplete and untruthful information to the Government in a SCA\nthat he completed on March 9, 2004.\nQuestion #24 of the SCA asked if Applicant had ever been charged with or convicted of any\noffense(s) related to alcohol or drugs. Applicant answered \"No.\" Applicant did not list that he was\narrested on July 19, 1994, and charged with Illegal Consumption of Liquor. He was found guilty of\nthe charge, fined $233 and placed on six months probation.\n\n4\nWhile Applicant admitted that he was arrested in 1994, he averred that his failure to include\nthis arrest on his SCA was an inadvertent omission, and that he did not intend to conceal information\nfrom the Government. I find Applicant\u2019s explanation credible that he simply failed to remember this\nevent as it had occurred approximately ten years before he completed the SCA, when he was twenty\nyears of age.  \nFinally, Applicant submitted three letters of recommendation (Exhibit B), from three\nindividuals who highly recommend Applicant as honest and trustworthy.  \nPOLICIES\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum. Accordingly, the Department of\nDefense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992 Directive, has set forth policy factors which must be given\n\"binding\" consideration in making security clearance determinations. These factors should be\nfollowed in every case according to the pertinent guideline. However, the factors are neither\nautomatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative\nJudge's reliance on his own common sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature and\nthe ways of the world, in making a reasoned decision. Because each security clearance case presents\nits own unique facts and circumstances, it cannot be assumed that these factors exhaust the realm\nof human experience, or apply equally in every case.\nAs set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17, \"In evaluating the relevance of\nan individual's conduct, the [Administrative Judge] should consider the following factors [General\nFactors]:\na. The nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct\nb. The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation\nc. The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd. The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne. The voluntariness of participation\nf. The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes\ng. The motivation for the conduct\nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\ni. The likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe eligibility guidelines established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics\nand conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question of whether it is \"clearly consistent\nwith the national interest\" to grant an Applicant's request for access to classified information.\nIn the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian\nworkers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information twenty-four hours a day.\nThe Government is therefore appropriately concerned where available information indicates that an\nApplicant for clearance may be involved in acts of drug usage, alcohol abuse and criminal conduct,\nand that demonstrates poor judgement, untrustworthiness or unreliability on the Applicant's part.\n\n5\nThe DoD Directive states, \"Each adjudication is to be an overall common sense\ndetermination based upon consideration and assessment of all available information, both favorable\nand unfavorable, with particular emphasis placed on the seriousness, recency, frequency, and\nmotivation for the individual's conduct; the extent to which conduct was negligent, willful,\nvoluntary, or undertaken with the knowledge of the circumstances or consequences involved; and,\nto the extent that it can be estimated, the probability that conduct will or will not continue in the\nfuture.\" \nThe Administrative Judge can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have a\nreasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record. The Judge cannot draw inferences or\nconclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature. Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \"Any determination under this order...shall be\na determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the\nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\"\nCONCLUSIONS\nIt is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding\nof a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant's conduct and the continued holding of a\nsecurity clearance. If such a case has been established, the burden then shifts to the Applicant to go\nforward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome or\noutweigh the Government's case. The Applicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving\nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him a security clearance.\n(Guideline H - Drug Involvement) \nWith respect to Guideline H, the Government has established its case. Applicant's improper\nand illegal drug abuse, including the use of marijuana and psilocybin mushrooms is of concern,\nespecially in light of his desire to have access to the nation's secrets.  The fact that Applicant used\nillegal substances, after applying for a security clearance must also be considered adversely.\nApplicant's overall conduct pertaining to his illegal substance abuse clearly falls within Drug\nInvolvement Disqualifying Condition (DC) (E2.A8.1.2.1.), any drug abuse, and DC (E2.A8.1.2.2.),\nillegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or\ndistribution.\nSince Applicant last used marijuana in August  2004, Applicant\u2019s conduct could be argued\nto come within Mitigating Condition(MC) (E2.A8.1.3.1.),  the drug involvement was not recent. MC\n(E2.A8.1.3.3.) also applies because of Applicant\u2019s credible stated intention not to continue using\nillegal substances in the future.\nIn this case, the Government has met its initial burden of proving that Applicant used illegal\ndrugs under Guideline H. However, Applicant, has successfully introduced evidence in rebuttal,\nexplanation and mitigation. I find that the mitigating conditions are sufficient to overcome the\nGovernment's case against him. Accordingly, Paragraph 1, Guideline H, is concluded for Applicant.\n\n6\n(Guideline E -Personal Conduct) \nWith respect to Guideline E, the evidence establishes that Applicant furnished to the\nGovernment an incomplete answer in the SCA that he executed on March 9, 2004. However, I find\nthat Applicant did not knowingly and willfully give untruthful information to the Government.\nWhile Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana after completing a SCA does show poor judgement, it\nwas done only on one occasion, and he testified that he has realized the folly of such conduct. \nIn reviewing the DCs under Guideline E, I conclude that no DCs apply because Applicant\ndid not deliberately provided false and  misleading information to the Government in a SCA.  I\nresolve Paragraph 2, Guideline E, for Applicant\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nParagraph 1. Guideline H: FOR  APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.: For Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.:  For Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c.:  For Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d.:  For Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e.:  For Applicant \nParagraph 2. Guideline E: FOR  APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a.: For Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b.: For Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nMartin H.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPhilip D. Cave, Esq.\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On July 22, 2005, DOHA issued a statement of reasons advising Applicant of the basis\nfor that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement) and Guideline E\n(Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended)\n(Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On October 23, 2006, after the hearing, Administrative\n\n2\nJudge John Grattan Metz, Jr. denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant\nsubmitted a timely appeal pursuant to Directive  \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.   \nApplicant submits the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge properly evaluated the\navailable mitigating factors; whether the Judge properly applied the whole person concept; and\nwhether the Judge\u2019s adverse clearance decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Finding\nno error, we affirm.\nWhether the Record Supports the Administrative Judge\u2019s Factual Findings\nA.  Facts\nApplicant first applied for a security clearance in 2000.  In completing the application, he\ndenied that he had used drugs, deliberately concealing his use of marijuana between January 1997\nand May 2000.  In early 2002, he executed another application, for a higher level clearance.  The\nanswers on this form were identical to those supplied in 2000, including the denial of wrongful drug\nuse.  Applicant asserted that he was not aware that he had been proposed for a higher clearance,\ndenying that it was he who had completed the 2002 security clearance application.  The Judge\nconcluded that \u201c[t]his statement is incredible because Applicant signed the application and because\nhe was interviewed by an investigator from the Defense Security Service (DSS) in 2003, as part of\nthe investigation for a higher clearance.  He variously claimed that he must have signed the second\napplication without reviewing it.\u201d  Decision at 2 (internal citation omitted).\nDuring this interview in 2003, he did not inform the investigator of his drug history.\nHowever, in 2004 he was nominated by his employer for special access to work on contracts for a\nnon-DoD client.  In September 2004, he completed a third application and on this one he disclosed\nhis marijuana use.  In response to Question 27, he admitted that he had used marijuana 15 times\nbetween January 1997 and May 2004.  In response to Question 28, he stated that he had used\nmarijuana 7 times between April and August 2004.  Concerning the latter period of use, Applicant\nadvised that he had been on a leave of absence from his employer at the time, hiking the Appalachian\nTrail and had used marijuana in the company of other hikers. \nApplicant stated that he finally reported his drug use because \u201che now understood the\nimportance of the drug questions and wanted to make a clean breast of things.\u201d  Decision at 3\n(internal citation omitted).  Applicant denied that he disclosed his drug use only because he knew\nhe was facing a polygraph as part of the 2004 application, although the Judge found that this denial\nis contradicted by Applicant\u2019s own evidence and by the testimony of a company investigator.\nB.  Discussion\nThe Appeal Board\u2019s review of the Judge\u2019s findings of fact is limited to determining if they\nare supported by substantial evidence\u2013such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as\nadequate to support such a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  Directive\n\u00b6  E3.1.32.1.  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing\ntwo inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency\u2019s findings\nfrom being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S.\n\nApplicant contends that the Judge should have found his drug use to be not recent as of the close of the record.\n1\nHowever, the Directive does not define \u201crecent.\u201d The Judge is  required to evaluate the record evidence as a whole and\nreach a reasonable conclusion as to the recency of an applicant\u2019s conduct.  ISCR Case 04-03849 (App. Bd. Jan. 26,\n2006). \n3\n607, 620-21 (1966).  In evaluating the Judge\u2019s findings, we are required to give deference to the\nJudge\u2019s credibility determinations.  Directive  \u00b6  E3.1.32.1. \nApplicant has not explicitly challenged the Judge\u2019s findings.  However, Applicant\u2019s appeal\nbrief denies that he deliberately falsified his application forms, implying a challenge to the Judge\u2019s\ncontrary findings.  We will address this issue in our discussion below. \n \nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Ultimate Conclusions\nA Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation\nfor\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choices made.\u2019\u201d\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43\n(1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. V. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  \u201cThe\ngeneral standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests\nof national security.\u2019\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 581, 528 (1988). The Appeal\nBoard may reverse the Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or revoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Directive  \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.32.3 and E3.1.33.3. \n\u201cThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and whole person factors does\nnot turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the particular facts of a case.  Rather,\ntheir application requires the exercise of sound discretion in light of the record evidence as a whole.\u201d\nSee ISCR Case No. 05-03635 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2006).   As stated above, Applicant contends\nthat it is error for the Judge to have found his false answers to be deliberate.  However, the record\nevidence supports the Judge\u2019s findings that Applicant knowingly falsified his 2000 application.  The\nrecord also supports the Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant had knowingly falsified his 2002\napplication.  The Judge could reasonably conclude that Applicant\u2019s explanations (that he was not\naware that the application had been submitted or that he signed it without verifying its contents) were\nimplausible.  Applicant\u2019s credibility was further diminished by his efforts to explain his decision\nfinally to admit his drug use.  Though implying that he did so because he had come to realize the\n\u201cseriousness of the question,\u201d his own evidence suggested that his actual motivation was the\nupcoming lifestyle polygraph which his proposed new duties necessitated, through which his drug\nuse would have most likely been discovered.  Therefore, the Judge\u2019s finding that Applicant\nknowingly provided false information about his drug history is supported by substantial record\nevidence.  \nWe note that \u201cthere is a strong presumption against  granting a security clearance.\u201d \nDorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert den 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  Once the\nth\ngovernment presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to\nestablish any appropriate mitigating conditions.  See Directive  \u00b6  E3.1.15.  The Judge\u2019s findings of\nfact, including the one challenged on appeal, support his decision that Applicant had failed in\nmeeting his burden.   Furthermore, we find no error in his whole person analysis.  The Judge took\n1\n\n4\ninto account Applicant\u2019s evidence as to his good work record and integrity.  However, he also\nbalanced that against contravening matters, such as the fact that Applicant\u2019s most recent use of\nmarijuana occurred while he held a security clearance and that the circumstances surrounding his\neventual admission of drug use vitiates his claims of  good faith.  Decision at 5.   We conclude that\nthe Judge\u2019s whole person analysis complies with the requirements of Directive  \u00b6  E2.2.1, in that the\nJudge considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s conduct in reaching his decision.  See ISCR Case No.\n04-09959 at 6 (App. Bd. May 19, 2006).    Accordingly the Judge\u2019s adverse clearance decision is\nneither arbitrary, capricious, nor contrary to law.\nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s decision denying Applicant a clearance is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Jean E.

And that\u2019s why I never put that down because I didn\u2019t \nknow it was a felony or not and to this day I still don\u2019t know if it is. Tr. 40. \n \nApplicant further stated and reemphasized he now understands the question \nincluded \u201ccharged with\u201d and \u201cconvicted of\u201d a felony (emphasis added). Knowing what he \nknows today, he would have answered the question differently. Tr. 41-43. \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife testified that she helped her husband complete his SF-86 and \nconsulted with her father, who is a retired police lieutenant from a major U.S. city. She \nstated her father advised her that her husband\u2019s assault charge was a misdemeanor. \nShe further stated, \u201cIt was not our intent to lie on the application. Certainly we knew that \nthey were going to do a background check and so we included that we thought was the \nfelony and again I just misread and didn\u2019t realize that it was also any type of charges, \nfelony charge.\u201d Tr. 19.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s father-in-law testified on his behalf. As indicated supra, his father-in-\nlaw is a retired police lieutenant from a major U.S. city. He stated, \u201cwhen my daughter \ncalled me and asked me about the question, the conviction for a felony I instructed my \ndaughter that his conviction in [major U.S. city] was not a felony conviction.\u201d Tr. 59. He \nfurther stated in response to a question whether he recalled which of the original \ncharges, if any, were felonies, he said, \u201cI believe it was assault with the intent to maim. I \nbelieve that\u2019s what it was. I know it was a felony assault charge. The conviction was a \ncommon law misdemeanor assault.\u201d Tr. 61. Applicant provided a table of applicable state \nlaw pertaining to assault. The table indicated that assault, 2nd degree, was a \nmisdemeanor under applicable state law. AE B. \n \nAt the time Applicant was convicted of assault, he was 22 years old. He served \n\u201c[c]lose to a year\u201d in prison. He completed all court-ordered probation, which included \nmaking restitution to the victim. In the 15 years since he was released from prison, he \n \n1 Applicant erroneously listed an October 1990 arrest as an October 1999 arrest. See Motion to \nAmend SOR supra.  \n\n \n4 \n \n \nhas not been involved in any sort of trouble, and has been a model citizen. He is \ninvolved in his children\u2019s baseball and football programs, golfs, and works on home \nprojects. Tr. 48-50, 54.     \n \nApplicant submitted seven reference letters. Extracts of those letters follow. His \nmother-in-law stated, \u201cI don\u2019t think my husband and I could have found a better spouse \nfor our daughter.\u201d AE C. His brother-in-law stated, \u201cI have no reservations about \n[Applicant\u2019s] character and trust him with my greatest possessions on this earth, my \nchildren.\u201d AE D. His Outside Plant Manager stated, \u201c[Applicant] has been a foreman on \nseveral of my jobs and has always shown his dedication and reliability.\u201d AE E. His \ncompany President stated, \u201c[Applicant] is an asset to our company, and I respect his \nstrong work ethic, dedication to our company, and reliability over the years.\u201d AE F.  \n \nAnother company Director stated, \u201c[Applicant] is a very loyal employee who has \ngreat work ethics and is extremely dedicated to the company and his job.\u201d AE G. His \ncompany Vice President stated, \u201c[Applicant] is an excellent worker with outstanding \nethics and overall skills. . . . I would give him the highest of recommendations.\u201d AE H. His \nHuman Resources Manager stated, \u201c[Applicant] is very hard working, committed to the \njob and our people, honest and very trustworthy.\u201d AE I. Applicant also submitted work \nperformance evaluations covering the period of 2001 to 2007. The evaluations document \nApplicant\u2019s sustained solid performance punctuated with above average performance. \nAE J \u2013 R. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nThe security concern relating to the Guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG & 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. \nOf special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the \nsecurity clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security \nclearance process. \n \nAG \u00b6 16 indicates two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case, including: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing, or (2) while in another \ncountry, engaging in any activity that is illegal in that country or that is \nlegal in that country but illegal in the United States and may serve as a \nbasis for exploitation or pressure by the foreign security or intelligence \nservice or other group.  \n \nPosing potential security concerns are Applicant\u2019s documented omissions of his \nfelony charge in 1990 from his SF-86 completed in January 2004. His omissions are \nattributable to his misunderstanding of the question asked. I note Applicant\u2019s formal \neducation ended before he completed the 9th grade. Applicant sought his wife\u2019s \nassistance in completing the SF-86, and it is clear from testimony submitted that they \nmisunderstood the question. Their misunderstanding was further corroborated by \nApplicant\u2019s father-in-law. He correctly answered the assault conviction was a \nmisdemeanor, but added when asked that the assault with intent to maim charge was a \nfelony. I found Applicant and his witnesses to be credible and were acting in good faith. \nWhile Applicant could reasonably have been expected to be more diligent when \nanswering Question 21, his judgment lapses and confusion are not enough to impute \nknowing and willful falsification under Guideline E.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s explanation of his omissions is persuasive enough to avert inferences \nof knowing and willful omission. There being no misconduct substantiated, there is no \nneed to discuss Personal Conduct Mitigating Conditions.  \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the Guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 30: \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \n \nFor reasons discussed supra, Applicant\u2019s conduct did not rise to a level of \nknowing and willful falsification and accordingly did not violate 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001, as \nalleged. Accordingly, further discussion of Criminal Conduct Disqualifying or Mitigating \nConditions under Guideline \u00b6\u00b6 31 and 32 is not warranted. \n \n \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \n\n \n7 \n \n \n                                                          \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the facts of the case and nine adjudicative process factors listed at \nAG \u00b6 2(a) supra. Falsifications are a core security concern. Inasmuch as Applicant\u2019s \nbehavior was not deliberate or willful, no misconduct was established precluding the \napplicability of further discussion under the Whole Person Concept. \n \nTo conclude, Applicant presented sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate the security concerns raised. Applicant met his ultimate burden of persuasion to \nobtain a favorable clearance decision. I take this position based on the law, as set forth \nin Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the \nwhole person factors\u201d2 and supporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors \nunder the Adjudicative Process, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the \nGuidelines. For the reasons stated, I conclude he is eligible for access to classified \ninformation.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a. \u2013 b.: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline J:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a.:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2See ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd.

Applicant requested a hearing.  On June 21, 2006, after the hearing, Chief\nAdministrative Judge Robert Robinson Gales granted Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nDepartment Counsel timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nDepartment Counsel raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Chief Administrative\nJudge\u2019s application of Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition (FIMC) 1 was arbitrary, capricious,\nand contrary to law and the record evidence; and whether the Chief Judge\u2019s whole-person analysis\nis unsustainable because the whole-person considerations relied upon are unsupported by the record\nevidence and their application is arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law.1\nWhether the Record Supports the Chief Judge\u2019s Factual Findings\nA.  The Chief Administrative Judge made the following relevant findings of fact:\nApplicant is an American citizen by birth, but grew up in Iran.  Applicant\u2019s grandfather died\nwhen Applicant was a small child, and Applicant\u2019s parents (his father, an Iranian citizen, and his\nmother, American) moved to Iran because Applicant\u2019s father inherited land at the death of his father.\nThe Iranian government seized the land.

Bush characterized as the \u201caxis of evil.\u201d\nWhile there was previously a lengthy period of friendship and cooperation between Iran and the U.S.\nwhen the Shah reigned, the situation changed when the fundamentalist Islamic Revolution toppled\nthe Shah in 1979.  The resulting theocratic government has repressed its people, pursued weapons\nof mass destruction, ignored customary principles of international law, endorsed fundamentalist\nMuslim political movements abroad, and supported international terrorism.  Iran has remained the\nmost active state sponsor of terrorism and has continued to exhort a variety of groups to use\nterrorism in pursuit of their goals.  Iran continues to pursue policies that are hostile to the U.S.  The\nU.S. does not currently have diplomatic or consular relations with Iran and cannot provide protection\nto U.S. citizens in that country.  Iran is known to conduct intelligence operations and economic\nespionage against the U.S., and is a nation whose interests are inimical to those of the U.S.\n\n \u201cA determination that the immediate family member(s) (spouse, father, mother, sons, daughters, brothers,\n2\nsisters), cohabitant, or associate(s) in question are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a\nforeign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the person(s) involved and the United\nStates\u201d Directive \u00b6 E2.A2.1.3.1.  \nB. Discussion\nThe appeal involves the Chief Administrative Judge\u2019s conclusions.\nWhether the Record Supports the Chief Administrative Judge\u2019s Ultimate Conclusions\nAn Administrative Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a\nsatisfactory explanation for\u201d the decision \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found\nand the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

The Appeal Board may reverse the Administrative Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or\nrevoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.3.\nOur scope of review under this standard is narrow, and we may not substitute our judgment for that\nof the Administrative Judge.  We may not set aside an Administrative Judge\u2019s decision \u201cthat is\nrational, based on consideration of the relevant factors, and within the scope of the authority\ndelegated to the agency. . .\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n, 463 U.S. at 42.  We review matters of law\nde novo.\n \nDepartment Counsel argues that the Chief Administrative Judge erred by applying FIMC 12\nand concluding that Applicant\u2019s family in Iran is not in a position to be exploited by the Iranian\ngovernment.  Department Counsel contends that the Chief Judge\u2019s conclusion regarding the\npossibility of exploitation is arbitrary, capricious, and unsupported by the record evidence.\nDepartment Counsel\u2019s argument has merit.  Application of FIMC 1 requires that an applicant\u2019s\nrelatives in a foreign country are not agents of a foreign government and that they are not in a\nposition to be exploited by a foreign government in a way that could force the applicant to choose\nbetween them and the United States.  Here, the Chief Judge stated that Applicant\u2019s family members\nhave no ties to the Iranian government.  Regarding the issue of exploitation, the Chief Judge noted\nthe inimical nature of Iran\u2019s relationship with the U.S., citing in particular Iran\u2019s support of terrorism\nand its intelligence operations and economic espionage against the U.S.  In this case, Applicant\u2019s\nparents have already suffered at the hands of the Iranian government.  Land owned by Applicant\u2019s\ngrandfather were seized by the Iranian government after his death.  At the time of the Islamic\nRevolution, Applicant\u2019s parents received death threats because of his mother\u2019s nationality.\nMoreover, Applicant\u2019s father, who had lived in the U.S. for ten years and held a green card, was not\nallowed to leave Iran for many years after his return from the U.S.  We have only Applicant\u2019s\ntestimony to indicate that the Iranian government would now allow him to emigrate to the U.S. if\na new green card were issued to him.                 \nAs discussed above, the evidence indicates that Applicant\u2019s parents live under a  regime\nhostile to the U.S.  The Board has previously held that an applicant with immediate family members\nliving in a country hostile to the U.S. has a heavy burden to show that those family ties do not pose\n\nAs authority for this statement, the Chief Judge cites to the decision of a fellow Administrative Judge in ISCR\n3\nCase No. 03-21434 (A.J. May 24, 2006).  That case was remanded by the Appeal Board because of error on the part of\nthe Judge.  See ISCR Case No. 03-21434 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2007).  The Board has previously noted that decisions by\nHearing Office Judges are not legally binding precedent on that Judge\u2019s colleagues or the Board. See ISCR Case No.\n04-04004 at 2 (App. Bd. July 31, 2006); and ISCR Case No. 02-24752 at 3 (App. Bd. July 31, 2006). \na security risk.  See, e.g. ISCR Case No. 04-06386 at 4 (App. Bd. Aug. 25, 2006); ISCR Case No.\n03-09053 at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2006).  As a result, Applicant has a greater burden than would be\nthe case for an applicant with relative living under another sort of government. Compare ISCR Case\nNo. 03-02878 at 3 (App. Bd. June 7, 2006); ISCR Case No. 03-19101 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 13, 2006).\nThe record evidence indicates that Applicant has close ties to his parents and speaks to his mother\nweekly.  Compare ISCR Case No. 04-06564 at 4 (App. Bd. May 30, 2006); ISCR Case No. 04-\n00631 at 5 (App. Bd. Sept. 6, 2006).  \nFinally, the Chief Judge found and the record evidence indicates that Applicant\u2019s family have\npreviously been targeted for coercion and exploitation by the Iranian regime.  Despite all this record\nevidence, the Chief Judge provides no analysis or discussion as to how those actions against\nApplicant\u2019s family heighten the government\u2019s security concerns presented in this case.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 04-00109 at 5-6 (App. Bd. July 13, 2006).  The Chief Judge states that \u201cthe mere\npossession of family ties with a person in a foreign country should not, as a matter of law, be\ndisqualifying under Guideline B.\u201d   He then writes:  \u201cBased on the evidence, I conclude the security\n3\nconcerns manifested by the government, in this instance, are largely unfounded.\u201d  Decision at 12.\nThe Chief Judge\u2019s conclusion in this regard is error, in that it ignores his own findings regarding the\nnature of the Iranian regime and the significance of its prior treatment of Applicant\u2019s family by that\nregime.  Such factors are \u201c. . . important evidence that provides context for all the other evidence of\nrecord and must be brought to bear on the Judge\u2019s ultimate conclusions in the case.\u201d  See, e.g., ISCR\nCase No. 04-02511 at 5 (App. Bd. March 20, 2007), quoting ISCR Case No. 04-07766 at 3 (App.\nBd. Sept. 26, 2006).  \nWith regard to Department Counsel\u2019s second argument, the Chief Judge\u2019s whole person\nanalysis is unsustainable in light of the foregoing, in that it fails to consider an important aspect of\nthe case, fails to articulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, and offers an explanation\nfor the decision that runs contrary to the record evidence.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 97-0435 at 3\n(July 14, 1998) (citing Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto Ins.\nCo., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)).\nThe Chief Judge\u2019s conclusory statement that Applicant has very close ties to the U.S. is not\nsupported by his own findings of fact.  Applicant is an American citizen by birth, but returned to\nIran, the country of his father, as a very young child and received most of his education there.  While\nApplicant visited the U.S. regularly with his mother and attended summer school in the U.S., he did\nnot move back to the U.S. until 2001, when he was already well into adulthood.  The favorable facts\nrecited by the Judge either do not readily suggest refutation, extenuation, or mitigation or have low\nprobative value.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-00109 at 5 (App. Bd. July 13, 2006). \n\nOrder\nThe decision of the Chief Administrative Judge granting Applicant a security clearance is\nREVERSED.\nSigned: Michael Y. Ra\u2019anan    \nMichael Y.

Applicant\u2019s grandfather died when Applicant was a small child, and Applicant\u2019s parents (his father, an Iranian citizen, and his mother, American) moved to Iran because Applicant\u2019s father inherited land at the death of his father. The Iranian government seized the land. Applicant\u2019s father eventually opened his own business. Applicant\u2019s father had a green card when he lived in the U.S. He was not allowed to return to the U.S. for many years, and the green card expired.

Iran has remained the most active state sponsor of terrorism and has continued to exhort a variety of groups to use terrorism in pursuit of their goals.

On November 29, 2006, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons1\n(SOR) detailing the basis for its decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline E (Personal\nConduct) and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued\non December 29, 2005, and implemented by the Department of Defense for SORs issued after\nSeptember 1, 2006. Applicant answered the SOR in writing on December 14, 2006, and elected to\nhave a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on January 23, 2007.\nA notice of hearing was issued on February 5, 2007, scheduling the hearing for February 28, 2007.\nThe hearing was conducted as scheduled to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. The Government offered three\nexhibits that were marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 3, and admitted without\nobjection. Applicant testified and called three witnesses. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.)\non March 12, 2007.\nRULINGS ON PROCEDURE\nDepartment Counsel requested administrative notice be taken of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001.2\nApplicant did not object, and I took administrative notice of that statute.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the allegations in the SOR, are incorporated herein. In addition,\nafter a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following\nfindings of fact:\nApplicant is a 44-year-old executive and partner in a limited liability company (LLC), which\nmaintains defense contracts. He is married, with three minor children. He served two years active\nduty, two years in the reserves, and two years inactive reserves in the United States Army.

He\nattended a course at X University in about 2000, and another in about 2001, but did not complete that\ncourse. X University has multiple campuses, including one in Applicant\u2019s state of residence. In about\n2003, Applicant applied for and received a bachelor\u2019s degree and a master\u2019s degree from Y\nUniversity.

There is no campus, and students do not receive study materials, or attend on line\nclasses. It is what is referred to as a \u201cdiploma mill.\u201d The bachelor\u2019s degree was dated as received in\n2000, and the master\u2019s degree was dated as received in 2003. Applicant paid $750 for each degree.4\nApplicant\u2019s company offered him a partnership in 2003. Before joining this company,\nApplicant worked for other defense contractors. Applicant and the two senior partners in his\ncompany knew each other from working together on various projects prior to Applicant coming to\nthe company. Applicant did not submit a resume or job application, and his education was not a\nfactor in his hiring. The senior partner based his decision on his positive work experiences with\nApplicant. Although not part of the hiring process, Applicant maintained a resume that did include\nhis degrees from Y University. There is no evidence that this resume was ever used to Applicant\u2019s\nbenefit. The LLC has four partners, including Applicant. The three partners testified that Applicant\u2019s\neducation was not, and is not, an issue to them, or in their business.  \n5\n  \nIn December 2003, Applicant submitted a security clearance application, Standard Form 86\n(SF-86). Applicant wrote his information for the application by hand, and submitted it to his facilities\nsecurity officer (FSO), who inputted the data electronically onto the form. Under education,\nApplicant wrote the information for both X University and Y University. The FSO called Applicant\nin the evening and asked him which college he received his degree from. He told her he did not\nfinish the course at X University, and that she should delete that information, and only list the Y\nUniversity data. The FSO either did not understand Applicant\u2019s directions, or simply made a\nmistake, because she inputted that he attended X University, from September 2000 to the present,\nand that he was awarded an MBA in January 2003. The address listed for X University was the\nmailing address for Y University. It is in a state that X University does not have a campus. The street\naddress contains the name of Y University. X University and Y University both begin with the same\nletter. X University contains seven letters in its name. Y University contains eight letters. When the\nform was printed for Applicant\u2019s signature, he did a cursory review and did not notice the inaccurate\ninformation. Applicant signed the SF-86 in December 2003, with the inaccurate education\ninformation about where he received his degree.  I find Applicant did not intentionally submit an\n6\ninaccurate SF-86.\nSometime in about 2004, Applicant watched a television show about a school similar to Y\nUniversity. Applicant realized that his degrees were tainted. Applicant removed any references to\nhis Y University degrees from his resume, and has not included those degrees on anything since then.\nThe web site of Applicant\u2019s company contains his biography. It makes no reference to Y University\nor any degrees.7\nApplicant was interviewed pursuant to his background investigation in 2004. The investigator\ntold Applicant that there is no X University in the state listed on the SF-86. Applicant told the\ninvestigator he did not receive a degree from X University, and explained his degrees from Y\n\nTr. at 36; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2.\n8\nTr. at 53, 66-68, 81, 88.\n9\nDepartment of the Navy v.

He told the investigator that X University was mistakenly listed on the SF-86, instead\nof Y University. I find Applicant told the investigator the truth about his mistake on the SF-86.8\nApplicant is highly regarded by his business partners. He is described as a man of the highest\nmoral standards, patriotic and loyal, someone who could be depended upon thoroughly and\ncompletely, and a truthful person.  \n9\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  As Commander in Chief, the President has\n10\n\u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine\nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person\naccess to such information.\u201d  The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to\n11\ngrant applicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  An applicant has the ultimate burden of\n12\ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his or her\nsecurity clearance. The clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations\nshould err, if they must, on the side of denials.  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant\n13\nshould be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such\nsensitive information.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a\n14\ndetermination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not\nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a\nclearance.  \n15\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth potentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and\nmitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline. Additionally, each security clearance decision\nmust be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and\ncircumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the adjudicative process factors listed in listed\nin the Directive and AG \u00b6 2(a).\nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those\nwhich would mitigate security concerns, are set forth and discussed in the conclusions section below.\n\nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-03472 at 6 (App. Bd. Mar. 11, 2007). \n16\n6\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards discussed above.\nI reach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the SOR.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to\ncomply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. Of special interest is any failure to\nprovide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other failure to\ncooperate with the security clearance process.\nAs discussed above, Applicant incorrectly answered the education question. A finding that\nthe answer was incorrect, however, is not dispositive of the issue of Applicant\u2019s falsification since\nthe mere proof of an omission or an incorrect answer, standing alone, does not establish or prove an\napplicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the omission or incorrect response occurred.  Applicant\n16\ntestified that his FSO mistakenly left in X University on the SF-86, instead of Y University. He did\nnot notice the slip when he signed the SF-86. That is reasonable under the circumstances. The names\nof the two schools are somewhat similar. The name of the correct school was in the address listed.\nApplicant had no motive to falsify the application, as it would have had no bearing on whether\nApplicant retained his security clearance, and his education had no impact on his job. \nI observed Applicant during his testimony, and accessed his demeanor and credibility. I find\nApplicant\u2019s inaccurate answer on his SF-86 was unintentional. I further find that Applicant provided\ntruthful information to the investigator in 2004, when he stated that the listing of X University was\na mistake. No Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition is applicable.\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nCriminal activity creates doubt about an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply\nwith laws, rules and regulations. \nIt is a criminal offense to knowingly and willfully make any materially false, fictitious, or\nfraudulent statement or representation in any matter within the executive branch of the Government\nof the United States. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001. Security clearances are within the jurisdiction of the\n\nSee Egan, 484 U.S. at 527. \n17\n7\nexecutive branch of the Government of the United States.  A violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 is a\n17\nserious offense as it may be punished by imprisonment for up to five years. Applicant did not\nknowingly and willfully made a materially false statement on his SF-86, as discussed above. His\nstatement to the investigator was truthful. No Criminal Conduct Disqualifying Condition is\napplicable. \nWhole Person Analysis\nThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is an acceptable security risk. Available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in\nreaching a determination. In evaluating Applicant\u2019s case, I have considered the adjudicative process\nfactors listed in the Directive. I have also considered every finding of fact and conclusion discussed\nabove. \nApplicant served in the U.S. Army and received an Honorable Discharge. He is very highly\nregarded by his partners. I do not find that he intentionally falsified his SF-86. He did not display the\nhighest degree of judgment by paying $1,500 for two essentially worthless degrees. Applicant\nrealized they did not amount to anything, and has not used the degrees for any purpose in several\nyears. The degrees were never a factor in his business. The only party harmed in any way by the\nreceipt of the degrees is the Applicant, who is out $1,500. Applicant\u2019s lapse of judgment in obtaining\nthe two degrees is not sufficient to warrant a denial of his security clearance.\nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions and evaluating all the evidence\nin the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns based\non his personal conduct and criminal conduct.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.  Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2.  Guideline J:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\n\n8\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. Clearance is\ngranted.\nEdward W. Loughran\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Her admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact.

TUIDER\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nEric Borgstrom, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nIn 1993, Applicant was convicted of theft while employed by an international package and\ndelivery company.  In 1994, she was arrested for fraudulent illegal use of credit cards.  In 1995, she\nwas subsequently convicted of this offense and sentenced to 15 months incarceration in a federal\nwomen\u2019s prison.  After her release from prison, she left one of her jobs under \u201cunfavorable\nconditions.\u201d  Considering the evidence as a whole, she was unable to mitigate criminal conduct\nconcerns.  Additionally, under 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986(c)(1), she cannot be granted access to classified\ninformation.  Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\n\nGE 1 (Electronic Standard Form (SF) 86, Security Clearance Application is dated July 21, 2004.  For\n1\nconvenience, the security application in this decision will be called SF 86.  The Government also submitted a second SF\n86, GE 2) dated July 22, 2004, which augmented the information contained in GE 1.\nOn Aug. 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a memorandum directing\n2\napplication of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines to all adjudications and other determinations made under the Directive\nand Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program (Regulation), dated Jan. 1987,\nas amended, in which the SOR was issued on or after Sep. 1, 2007. The revised Adjudicative Guidelines are applicable\nto Applicant\u2019s case. \n2\nOn July 21, 2004, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted a Security\nClearance Application (SF 86).   On May 10, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n1\n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to her, pursuant to Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and\nmodified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended, modified, and revised.2\nThe SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct).  In addition, the\nSOR includes an allegation that Applicant is disqualified, as a matter of law, from having a security\nclearance granted or renewed by the Defense Department under 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986.  The SOR detailed\nreasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it\nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for her, and\nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted,\ncontinued, denied, or revoked.  \nIn an answer notarized on June 6, 2007, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and\nasked for a hearing.  Applicant\u2019s Response to SOR was received at DOHA on June 7, 2007.  The\ncase was assigned to me on July 6, 2007.  On July 20, 2007, DOHA issued a notice of hearing,\nscheduling the hearing on August 9, 2007.  The hearing was conducted as scheduled.  \nThe government submitted five documentary exhibits that were admitted without objections\nas Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5.  The Applicant testified and submitted 17 documents that\nwere admitted as Appellant Exhibits (AE) A through Q without objection, except for AE L through\nO. As to AE L through O, Department Counsel objected to those documents, which were unsigned\nperformance evaluations, on authenticity grounds.  \nI allowed the record to be held open to afford Applicant the opportunity to submit signed\nperformance evaluations and other material.  Applicant timely submitted additional documents post-\nhearing, which included signed copies of her performance evaluations, which addressed Department\nCounsel\u2019s objection.  The post-hearing documents were marked and admitted without objections as\nAE R and S as well as AE A through Q.  DOHA received the transcript on August 22, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\n\nAlthough this arrest and conviction was not alleged as part of the SOR, it is indicative of Applicant\u2019s conduct\n3\nand therefore relevant in assessing Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance.\n3\nIn her response to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations in the SOR.  Her admissions\nare incorporated herein as findings of fact.  After a complete and thorough review of the evidence\nof record, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 36-year-old senior graphics artist.  She has been employed by a defense\ncontractor since April 2004, and is a first-time applicant for a security clearance.  She graduated from\nhigh school in June 1989.  She was awarded an associate\u2019s degree in computer animation in June\n2003.  At the time of graduation, she was given a certificate for \u201coutstanding achievement.\u201d  Tr. 32,\n43, AE A, AE B.  After being awarded her associate\u2019s degree, Applicant earned certificates in\nadvanced AutoCAD and Architectural Development Programs to become an Autodesk professional.\nTr. 33, AE C, AE D.  Applicant is currently attending college part-time working toward a bachelor\nof arts degree.  She estimates she has 111 credit hours and expects to graduate in 2009.  Tr. 23, 43-44.\nApplicant has been married since December 2001 and has no children.\nIn February 1993, Applicant was arrested and charged with theft.  She was sentenced to 90\ndays in jail, 12 months probation.  She stated the theft occurred while she was an employee of an\ninternational package and delivery company.  The item she stole was a \u201cgold ring with a stone on it\u201d\nfrom a package being shipped.  She stated she never went to jail, but did serve her probation.  Tr. 50-\n52, GE 4.3\nApplicant was arrested in November 1994 and charged with fraud - illegal use of credit cards,\na felony.  She was subsequently indicted on that charge in February 1995, and pled guilty in federal\ndistrict court March 1995.  Pursuant to her plea, she was found guilty and sentenced in January 1996\nto 15 months in prison to be followed by three years probation.  She reported to a federal woman\u2019s\nprison in February 1996 and was released in April 1997, a period of 15 months.  Tr. 10-11, GE 3\nthrough 5.  She completed her probation in April 2000.  AE S.  Applicant provided an explanation\nregarding this offense, which is quoted in part:\nCriminal docket for Case No. [Number] lists that I was convicted of one count of\ncredit card fraud.  Upon reading this document, it is my opinion that any normal\nperson would assume that I was involved in some type of  fraudulent Visa, Master\nCard or other financial card transactions.  This is not the case at all.  Absolutely no\nfinancial bank cards or theft of money from a financial institution was involved\nwhatsoever.  What the criminal docket does not say is that there were no fraudulent\nfinancial transactions of any kind nor were any bank cards involved.  No financial\ncards were stolen, no IDs were stolen, nor were there any bank accounts of any kind\ninvolved.  Please let me explain what happened, but just as a side note, everything that\nhappened took place before there was an Internet or a world-wide web.  This point is\nimportant to know because this case involved what was called BBSs or bulletin board\nsystems on computers.  From what I found out after the court case was over, a person\nwhom I never met or had spoken to named [Suspect 1] worked for a large telephone\ncompany.  He somehow generated false telephone calling card numbers and these\nnumbers were used to make telephone calls anywhere around the world. [Suspect 1]\nwas friends with a person named [Suspect 2] in [State A].  I met [Suspect 2] over a\n\n4\ntelephone call through a gentleman named [Suspect 3] in [State B].  I met [Suspect 3]\non a computer BBS, but never met him personally.  My part in the crime that was\ncommitted was because that I was the middle man between [Suspect 2] in [State A]\nand [Suspect 3] in [State B].  My job as the middle man was to transfer computer text\nfiles which contained lists of telephone calling card numbers from [Suspect 2] in\n[State A] to various people in [Country A] and [Country B].  The recipients in\n[Country A] would then use these telephone numbers to make calls from [Country A]\nto  [Suspect 3]\u2019s computer where they download hundreds of various computer games\nand software programs.  The people in [Country A] would pay [Suspect 3] for\ndownloading the computer software. [Suspect 3] would also pay [Suspect 2] for the\ncalling numbers.  In return for my participation I was also given free access to\n[Suspect 3]\u2019s BBS.  The Secret Service investigated my crime and chose not to\nconvict me under any computer crimes.  They decided instead that my crime should\nbe credit card fraud.  Tr. 28-30, AE P.\nApplicant stated as a result of her participation in this crime, she earned \u201ca couple hundred\ndollars.\u201d  Tr. 49.  In response to Department Counsel\u2019s question, \u201cSo it was at least alleged that at\nleast the numbers that you passed on ultimately cost approximately seven million dollars in - -\u201d, she\nresponded, \u201cYeah, what happened was that my lawyer requested - - because my public defender tried\nto defend me before everything was completed to finalize all the paperwork and they came up with\nan amount of money based on like the number of calls that what were made that were called from\n[Country A] and different places and then they used that formula to estimate how much [Telephone\nCompany 1] or [Telephone Company 2] lost in whatever revenue that they felt they would get from\nthose calls.\u201d  Tr. 54. \nAfter Applicant was released from prison, she held several jobs to include working for a\npublishing company from October 1997 to February 2002.  She left the company under \u201cunfavorable\ncircumstances\u201d for selling books that were given to her company by vendors.  She stated she made\n\u201cabout $1,000\" in these unauthorized sales.  Referring to her employer at the time, she said, \u201cThey\nwere really mad.  They were extremely mad at me and they said that I didn\u2019t represent the company\nin a favorable manner and they fired me.\u201d  GE 2, Tr. 56-58.\nLater on, she also was a seasonal worker at a toy company from October 2002 to January 2003\nand stated she was told by her employer, \u201cdon\u2019t bother coming back\u201d if she went home for being sick.\nApplicant stated she left this job \u201cunder unfavorable circumstances.\u201d  GE 2, Tr. 59-60.\nApplicant\u2019s three years of performance evaluation document above average performance.  AE\nL through O, AE R.  Her current employer named her \u201cEmployee of the Year\u201d two times.  Applicant\nalso submitted several commendatory certificates and a training certificate.  AE E through H.  It is\nclear that her employer considers her to be a valued employee, which is evidenced by several pay\nraises.  AE I through K.  Applicant also submitted a reference letter from a colleague who described\nher as \u201ca good honest, and trustworthy person.\u201d  AE P, AE Q.  Applicant\u2019s right to vote was restored\nin September 2004.  AE R.\nPOLICIES\n\n\u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a\n4\nconclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006)\n(citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1).  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing\ntwo inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial\nevidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966).  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a\nscintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v.Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4  Cir. 1994).\nth\n5\nIn an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s security suitability, an administrative judge must consider\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive, which sets forth adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief introductory\nexplanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines are divided into disqualifying conditions\n(DC) and mitigating conditions (MC), which are used to determine an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access\nto classified information.\nThese adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, an administrative judge should apply these guidelines in conjunction\nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process provision in Section E2.2, Enclosure 2, of the\nDirective.  An administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common\nsense decision.  Because the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known\nas the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d an administrative judge should consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a meaningful\ndecision.\nSpecifically, an administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors\nlisted at Directive \u00b6 E2.2.1: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and\nrecency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the\nvoluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those\nwhich could mitigate security concerns pertaining to the relevant adjudicative guidelines are set forth\nand discussed in the Conclusions section below.  Since the protection of the national security is the\nparamount consideration, the final decision in each case is arrived at by applying the standard that the\nissuance of the clearance is \u201cclearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence\ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation\nor conjecture.\nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d   The\n4\ngovernment initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a potentially disqualifying\ncondition under the Directive.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 provides, \u201cThe applicant is responsible for\npresenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by\napplicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] has the ultimate burden of persuasion\n\n?The Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and unfavorable,\n5\n[evaluates] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the Directive, and [decides]\nwhether Applicant [has] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App.\nBd. July 6, 2006). \n6\nas to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  The burden of disproving a mitigating condition\nnever shifts to the government.  See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).5\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with\nthe government predicated upon trust and confidence. It is a relationship that transcends normal duty\nhours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is because of this special relationship that the\nGovernment must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to\nwhom it grants access to classified information.  Decisions under this Directive include, by necessity,\nconsideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible\nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\nThe scope of an administrative judge\u2019s decision is limited. Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, and\npatriotism are not at issue in these proceedings.  Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically\nprovides industrial security clearance decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall\nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  Security clearance\ndecisions cover many characteristics of an applicant other than allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism.\nNothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or\nin part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.\nCONCLUSIONS\nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate legal\nprecepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly above, I conclude the following\nwith respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR:\nGuideline J (Criminal Conduct)\nGuideline \u00b6 30 explains the Government\u2019s concern about criminal conduct stating, \u201c[c]riminal\nactivity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature,\nit calls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\u201d\nGuideline \u00b6 31 indicates three Criminal Conduct Disqualifying Conditions that could raise a\nsecurity concern in this case, including:\n(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses;\n\nUnder the provisions of 10 U.S.C. 986, a person who has been convicted in a Federal or State court, including\n6\ncourts martial, sentenced to imprisonment for a term exceeding one year and incarcerated for not less than one year, may\nnot be granted or have renewed access to classified information.  In a meritorious case, the Secretaries of the Military\nDepartments or designee, or the Directors of WHS, DIA, NSA, DOHA or designee may authorize a waiver of this\nprohibition.  Within DOHA, waivers are governed by Operating Instruction (OI) 64. In summary, OI 64 implements the\nwaiver authority granted to the Director of DOHA by the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence). Also, OI 64\naddresses an administrative judge\u2019s responsibilities in handling a case. First, a judge\u2019s authority is limited to determining\nif the law applies to the facts of the case. Second, if it does apply, no waiver recommendation of any kind will be made.\n7\n(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was\nformally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted; and\n(f) conviction in a Federal or State court, including a court-martial of a crime,\nsentenced to imprisonment for a term exceeding one year and incarcerated as a result\nof that sentence for not less than a year.  \n6\nThe Government produced substantial evidence of these three disqualifying conditions as it\npertains to Applicant\u2019s past criminal conduct and applicability of 10 U.S.C. 986.  \nGuideline \u00b6 indicates three potential Criminal Conduct Mitigating Conditions:\n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened\nunder such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;\n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the\npassage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job\ntraining or higher education, good employment record, or constructive community\ninvolvement; and\n(e) potentially disqualifying conditions (b) and (f) above, may not be mitigated unless,\nwhere meritorious circumstances exist, the Secretaries of the Military Departments or\ndesignee; or the Directors of Washington Headquarters Services (WHS), Defense\nIntelligence Agency (DIA), National Security Agency (NSA), Defense Office of\nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) or designee, has granted a waiver.\nNotwithstanding Applicant\u2019s successful completion of probation, furthering her education,\nrecent employment success, and strides in rehabilitation, an administrative judge must look at the\nrecord as a whole before reaching a final decision.  Troubling in this case is the nature of the crimes\ninvolved.  At age 23, Applicant, while in a position of trust and responsibility as an employee of an\ninternational package and delivery company, violated the trust placed in her by stealing a ring\ncontained in a package.  She was convicted and sentenced for this crime.  \nApproximately four years later, at age 26, she was arrested for credit card fraud and pursuant\nto her guilty plea, was sentenced and served 15 months at a federal woman\u2019s prison.  It\u2019s unclear the\nexact amount of money the victims in this case lost, but it is safe to say the amount was substantial.\nAs evidenced by her statement at her hearing, Applicant appears to downplay her role in this offense,\nbut a federal district court judge determined her crime serious enough to warrant a 15 month prison\n\nSee ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd. June 28, 2006). \n7\n8\nsentence followed by three years of probation.  Further troubling is this offense involved conduct over\na period of time as opposed to a single isolated event.\nAfter she was released from prison and while employed by a publishing company from 1997\nto 2002, she was fired for selling books that were provided to her company by vendors.  This conduct\nis not isolated to one event and, like her 1994 offense, involved conduct over a period of time.  This\nbehavior leaves me with doubt as to the Applicant\u2019s future resolve.  Accordingly, I find none of the\nmitigating conditions applicable under this concern.  In reaching this conclusion, the whole-person\nconcept was given due consideration and that analysis does not support a favorable decision. \n\u201cBecause of the extreme sensitivity of security matters, there is a strong presumption against\ngranting a security clearance. Whenever any doubt is raised . . . it is deemed best to err on the side of\nthe government\u2019s compelling interest in security by denying or revoking [a] clearance.\u201d Dorfmont v.\nBrown, 913 F.2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990). After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating\nth\nconditions, all the facts and circumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant\nhas not mitigated the security concerns pertaining to criminal conduct.  Applicant\u2019s overall criminal\nconduct and conduct since her release from prison when weighed against her positive\naccomplishments leaves me with doubts as to her security eligibility and suitability.\nViewing the record evidence as a whole, Applicant did not present sufficient evidence to\nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate the criminal conduct security concerns alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a.\nFurthermore, based on her conviction and serving 15 months of confinement,  she is disqualified from\nhaving a security clearance granted (or renewed) by the Defense Department under 10 U.S.C. \u00a7\n986(c)(1).  Accordingly, this case is decided against Applicant based primarily on her criminal\nconduct as well as the applicability of 10 U.S.C. 986.\nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518\n(1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d  and supporting evidence, my\n7\napplication of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative Process, and my interpretation of my\nresponsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant has not mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case.\nFor the reasons stated, I conclude she is not eligible for access to classified information.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a - 1.b.:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\n\n9\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  Clearance is denied.\nRobert J. Tuider\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Edmunds, Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On April 7, 2006, DOHA issued a statement of reasons advising Applicant of the basis\n\nApplicant did not provide a copy of these documents and/or their cover letter to corroborate this assertion on\n1\nappeal.\n2\nfor that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a decision on the written record.  On October 20, 2006,\nafter considering the record, Administrative Judge Jacqueline T. Williams denied Applicant\u2019s request\nfor a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to Directive  \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant has submitted the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s finding that\nApplicant failed to submit proof of debt repayment is based on substantial evidence.  Specifically,\nApplicant asserts that he submitted such proof, but for reasons he does not understand this proof did\nnot make its way into the record.  We affirm the Judge\u2019s decision.\nOther than the matter referenced above, Applicant does not challenge the Judge\u2019s findings.\nThese findings establish that Applicant had thirteen delinquent debts, totaling about $37,288, which\nconstitute the security concerns alleged under Guideline F.  For five of these debts, Applicant averred\nthat he had paid them or was making arrangements for payment.  The Judge stated, however, that\n\u201cthe record is devoid of evidence of payment.\u201d  Furthermore, Applicant used his company credit card\nto pay personal debts not related to his employment, for which he received formal counseling.  That\ncircumstance constitutes the security concern alleged under Guideline E.\nIn examining the issue on appeal, we note that the record demonstrates the following: on\nApril 11, 2006, DOHA provided Applicant a copy of the SOR, which he answered on April 28,\n2006.  On July 13, 2006, Applicant was provided a copy of the File of Relevant Material (FORM).\nHe did not respond to the FORM within the 30 days allotted.  The Judge received the FORM for her\ndecision on August 28, 2006.\nIn his appeal submission, Applicant states that, on May 6, 2006, he mailed to DOHA\ndocumentation which he asserts would substantiate his repayment efforts, but which was not\nincluded in the FORM.  Having submitted this material by regular mail, Applicant acknowledges\nthat he has no means of corroborating his assertion.  In his appeal submission, he describes these\nmatters as follows: \u201cThe documentation submitted provided proof of initiating and effort of paying\n3 of the smaller bills in full and proof of payment arrangement with others.  I also provided a copy\nof letters  submitted to the 3 creditors requesting payment arrangements and or settlement\nagreements. . .  I have paid off several of my [debts] over the [past] 8 years which I believe was not\nconsidered.\u201d       \n1\nIn her discussion of Applicant\u2019s case, the Judge gave weight to the fact that Applicant never\nprovided a reasonable explanation as to how he got into financial trouble in the first place, that his\nundisputed debts were of a substantial amount, that the file contained no basis to believe that\nApplicant ever sought counseling for his financial troubles, and that Applicant attempted to lessen\nhis problems through misuse of his company credit card.  Decision at 7.

HOWE\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nBraden M. Murphy, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\n\n2\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant is 30 years old, and a licensed pharmacist.  She became addicted to vicodin and\noxycodine after initially taking dentist prescribed vicodin for a dental condition.  During that time\nshe was a pharmacy manager with access to controlled substances.  For 16 months she took from her\nemployer\u2019s stocks these medicines for herself.  When discovered by her employer, she was\nterminated and arrested.  Then she entered an inpatient treatment program.  She remains in the\nprogram and is monitored by her state\u2019s pharmacist regulatory agency.  The DOHA Appeal Board\nremanded the case to consider a document Applicant submitted.  She did not mitigate the drug\ninvolvement, personal and criminal conduct trustworthiness concerns.  Her eligibility for assignment\nto sensitive positions is denied.\n\nAdjudication of trustworthiness cases for ADP I, II, and III positions are resolved using the provisions of\n1\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive).  Memo from Carol A. Haave, Deputy Under Secretary of\nDefense for Counterintelligence and Security to DOHA Director, Adjudication of Trustworthiness Cases (Nov. 19,\n2004)\nPursuant to Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), as\n2\namended and modified, and the Directive.\n3\nREMAND STATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a\nApplicant\u2019s application for a position of trust .  On October 12, 2005, DOHA issued a Statement of\n1\nReasons  (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline H (Drug\n2\nInvolvement), Guideline E (Personal Conduct), and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) of the Directive.\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on November 2, 2005.  Applicant requested her case be\ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. \nOn March 1, 2006, Department Counsel submitted the Department\u2019s written case.  A\ncomplete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) was provided to the Applicant.  She was\ngiven the opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation.\nApplicant filed a response to the FORM on April 6, 2006.  The Department Counsel, on April 19,\n2006, objected to the response because it included a handwritten statement from Applicant\u2019s\npsychiatrist dated April 5, 2006.  The Department Counsel objected on the basis he could not cross-\nexamine the psychiatrist, and the offering of this statement was a surprise because the psychiatrist\nwas not disclosed in Applicant\u2019s Answer.  The case was assigned to me on April 20, 2006. \nOriginally, I upheld the objection and did not admit the psychiatrist\u2019s handwritten statement\ninto evidence, and did not consider it as evidence.  Subsequently, I referred to the Applicant\u2019s\nresponse in the findings of fact, meaning her written response, not the psychiatrist\u2019s letter, which\nApplicant referred to as a \u201cletter of reference.\u201d  Some confusion arose because Item 3 contains a\nNovember 2, 2005, letter from a pharmacist who declared Applicant was \u201cclean and sober,\u201d the\nwords I used in my penultimate finding of fact.  The reference letter of April 5, 2006, to which the\nDepartment Counsel objects, only uses the word \u201csober\u201d to describe Applicant.  However, I did refer\nto that letter in my conclusions.  The DOHA Appeal Board decided in Applicant\u2019s appeal of my\ndecision that the document should be admitted into evidence and considered.  The Board remanded\nthe case to me to take that action.  Therefore, the psychiatrist\u2019s document submitted as part of\nApplicant\u2019s response to the FORM is now admitted.  I will consider it, but give it the weight I think\nit merits in this case.\nFurthermore, pursuant to the Appeal Board\u2019s remand decision, I gave both parties time to\nsubmit additional arguments, and the Department Counsel time to submit rebuttal evidence.  My\norder was prepared on March 14, 2007, and expressed to both parties.  The Department Counsel\nsubmitted only additional arguments objecting to weight being given to the psychiatrist\u2019s report in\na response dated March 26, 2007.  Applicant had until April 11, 2007, to respond t .  She did not\nsubmit any arguments or additional documents by that date and the record closed on April 12, 2007.\nREMAND FINDINGS OF FACT\n\n4\nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations and they are incorporated here as findings of\nfact.  After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and full consideration of\nthat evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact:\nApplicant is 30 years old and a licensed pharmacist since 2000.  She worked for a pharmacy\nas a pharmacist manager, having access to all prescription and controlled substances dispensed by\nthat pharmacy in the normal course of the pharmacy profession.  This pharmacist position\ncommenced after her graduation from college.  In July 2002, her dentist prescribed vicodin as a pain\nreliever for an infected tooth.  Applicant took one or two tablets of vicodin daily as needed to relieve\npain.  Soon she started taking more vicodin and  by September 2002 she was using two or three\ntablets per day several times a week.  By December 2002 she was using eight to twelve tablets daily.\nHer prescription having expired after the initial period, she was stealing  vicodin from the pharmacy\nstock to feed her addiction  to the controlled substance.  In February 2003 she started taking\noxycodine plus the vicodin because it was a more powerful combination that she enjoyed.  She\ncontinued that combination until November 2003. (Items 3-5)\nThe pharmacy discharged Applicant in November 2003 when an audit by her employer found\nshortages of the prescription drugs vicodine (hydrocodone) and oxycodone.  Applicant took without\nauthority or permission numerous tablets of the vicodine (hydrocodone) from her employers stocks\nfrom about July 2002 to November 2003.  She took without authority or permission the oxycodone\nfrom about February to November 2003.  Applicant became addicted to these prescription\nmedications during the 16 months she was stealing  them. (Items 3-5)\nAt the time of her discharge, Applicant was arrested by the local police force, and placed in\njail.  Applicant was charged with theft, but there is no disposition from the criminal court system\nsubmitted by Applicant shown in the file.  She was also charged administratively by the state\npharmacy board with violation of her state\u2019s pharmacist regulatory statute.  She was placed on\nprobation by the state regulatory agency and a monitoring plan, dated November 18, 2003, created\nfor her case.  Her probation requirements include refraining from acting as a pharmacist in charge\nfor two years, no solo practice, a 90 day suspension of practice, and refraining from administering\nor having any responsibility for controlled substances.  Applicant also must submit periodic reports,\nand is on probation for 36 months, which is the minimum period for her abstinence from alcohol and\ndrugs and in compliance with mental health treatment recommendations.  The monitoring agreement\nis a four page written agreement Applicant signed.  Her probation continues to at least May 2007.\n(Items 3, 6-8)\nAfter her termination, Applicant enrolled in an in-patient narcotic treatment and rehabilitation\nprogram for about 30 days.  She was successfully discharged from that program at the end of\nDecember 2003.  She participates in a continuing care program, including Alcoholics/Narcotics\nAnonymous (AA) meetings with a sponsor, and has random urine drug screens.  She had them\nduring 2004 to the present, and passed each one.  Since at least June 2004 she participates in the\npharmacy recovery network program biweekly.  The other week she attends the outpatient program\nfor rehabilitation that she has been in since December 2003.  The director, a pharmacist, of that\nprogram states Applicant remained clean and sober since her enrollment. (Items 3-8) \nApplicant\u2019s self-described \u201cletter of reference\u201d from a psychiatrist dated April 5, 2006,\ndescribes Applicant only as \u201csober\u201d for the past two years.  Neither Applicant nor the psychiatrist\nexplain if or when he provided treatment to her and the basis for his comments and evaluation.\n\n5\nThere is no explanation why he is not mentioned in any of the other documents she submitted.  The\nletter of reference is hand-written and not notarized.  Applicant refers to his letter as a \u201cletter of\nreference submitted on my behalf by an accredited medical professional. . .\u201d  Guideline H contains\nthe term \u201ccredentialed medical professional\u201d and defines it as a \u201cphysician, clinical psychiatrist, or\npsychiatrist.\u201d (Items 3, 7, 8, FORM Response)\nAfter discharge from the narcotic treatment program, Applicant obtained a job as a consulting\npharmacist with another company.  She continues to work there to date, and seeks a trustworthiness\ndetermination.  She filed that application on May 25, 2004. (Item 4)  \nPOLICIES\nAs Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information\nbearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to\noccupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d Department of the Navy\nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 527 (1988).  The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his\ndesignee to grant applicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that\nit is clearly consistent the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation with Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960).  By direction of the Under Secretary of Defense for\nCounterintelligence and Security, adjudications of cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense\nSecurity Service or the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) for a trustworthiness determination\nshall be conducted under the provisions of the Directive.  Eligibility for a position of trust is\npredicated upon the applicant meeting the guidelines contained in the Directive and a finding it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so. See Directive \u00b6 2.3.  An applicant \u201chas the\nultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or\ncontinue his trustworthiness determination.\u201d See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15\nThe adjudication process is based on the whole person concept.  Enclosure 2 of the Directive\nsets forth personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating\nconditions (MC) under each guideline that must be carefully considered in making the overall\ncommon sense determination required.  The decision to deny an individual eligibility to occupy a\nposition of trust is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  See Exec. Or.\n10865 \u00a7 7.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President\nand the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a such a determination.\nIn evaluating the trustworthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess\nthe adjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6 6.3 of the Directive.  Those assessments include:  (1) the\nnature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, and\nthe extent of knowledgeable participation; (3) how recent and frequent the behavior was; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6)\nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood\nof continuation or recurrence (See Directive, Section E2.2.1. of Enclosure 2).  Because each case\npresents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that the factors exhaust\nthe realm of human experience or that the factors apply equally in every case.  Moreover, although\nadverse information concerning a single condition may not be sufficient for an unfavorable\n\n6\ndetermination, the individual may be disqualified if available information reflects a recent or\nrecurring pattern of questionable judgment, irresponsibility, or other behavior specified in the\nGuidelines.\nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal\nor professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being\neligible to occupy a position of trust.  The Directive presumes a nexus or rational connection\nbetween proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an\napplicant\u2019s trustworthiness suitability.  See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).\nAll that is required is proof of facts and circumstances that indicate an applicant is at risk for\nmishandling classified information, or that an applicant does not demonstrate the high degree of\njudgment, reliability, or trustworthiness required of persons handling classified information.  ISCR\nCase No. 00-0277, 2001 DOHA LEXIS 335 at **6-8 (App. Bd. 2001).  Once the Government has\nestablished a prima facie case by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut,\nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate\nburden of demonstrating that is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his\ntrustworthiness determination. ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. 2002).  \u201cAny doubt as to\nwhether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved\nin favor of the national security.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E2.2.2\nBased upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative\nguidelines most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:\nGuideline H: Drug Involvement: The Concern. Improper or illegal involvement with drugs,\nraises questions regarding an individual's willingness or ability to protect classified information.\nDrug abuse or dependence may impair social or occupational functioning, increasing the risk of an\nunauthorized disclosure of classified information. E2.A8.1.1\nGuideline E: Personal Conduct: The Concern: Conduct involving questionable judgment,\nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules\nand regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.\nE2.A5.1.1\nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct: The Concern: A history or pattern of criminal activity\ncreates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability and trustworthiness. E2.A10.1.1\nREMAND CONCLUSIONS\nThe Government established by substantial evidence and Applicant\u2019s admissions each of the\nallegations in the SOR.  I have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards.\nDrug Involvement Guideline H: Based on all the evidence, the Disqualifying Conditions\n(DC) 1 (any drug abuse of a controlled substance, including use of a legal drug that deviates from\napproved medical direction. E2.A8.1.2.1) and DC 3 (Diagnosis by a credentialed medical\nprofessional (a psychiatrist, physician, or clinical psychologist) of drug dependence (E2.A8.1.2.3)\napply.  Applicant abused vicodin and oxycodine for about a 16-month period in 2002 and 2003.  Her\n\n7\npsychiatrist in his submission attached to Applicant\u2019s FORM Response diagnosed her with chemical\ndependency.  However, because his letter is only one of reference and not a properly drafted\npsychiatric opinion, Applicant failed to meet her burden of persuasion that this letter should support\nany Mitigating Conditions or should be given any weight.  She did not show this psychiatrist treated\nher, or based his letter on personal observations in a professional consultation.  The psychiatrist does\nnot provide a foundation for his conclusions and recommendations.  More importantly, he does not\nprovide his professional credentials.  I conclude the letter is inadequate and does not comport with\nrequisite legal standards for a professional\u2019s opinion.  Thus, I give it no weight and it is not\npersuasive.\nThere are no Mitigating Conditions (MC) applicable under this guideline.  Her drug\ninvolvement is recent and for that reason Applicant remains on probation from her state regulatory\nauthority until at least May 2007.  Her drug involvement was not isolated or aberrational.  She may\nassert that she has no intent to abuse drugs in the future, but she is prohibited from dispensing\nnarcotics under the probationary terms and has not made that declaration in a hearing where her\ncredibility can be judged, and her testimony tested by cross-examination.  She continues in an\naftercare program, so she has not completed it.  There is no favorable prognosis yet and it is too early\nto determine if abuse will recur.  She has a history of a serious drug abuse problem and has not met\nher burden of proof and persuasion, which is to demonstrate that she has resolved her problems\nbeyond her current rehabilitation environment.  I also considered the fact she did not enter a\nrehabilitation program until after she was apprehended and terminated from her job.  I conclude this\nguideline against Applicant.\nPersonal Conduct Guideline E: Regarding the personal conduct concern, DC 1 (Reliable,\nunfavorable information provided by associates, employers, coworkers, neighbors, and other\nacquaintances. E2.A5.1.2.1), DC 4 (Personal conduct that increases an individual\u2019s vulnerability to\ncoercion, exploitation or duress, such as engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the\nperson\u2019s personal, professional, or community standing or render the person susceptible to\nblackmail. E2.A5.1.2.4), and DC 5 (A pattern of dishonesty or rule violations, including violation\nof any written or recorded agreement made between the individual and the agency. E2.A5.1.2.5).\nApplicant\u2019s employer terminated her because she stole vicodin and oxycodine from the pharmacy\nstocks for her own use.  Theft of that nature violates a basic tenet of the pharmacy profession, and\nis a serious breach of trust.  Her addiction and thefts make her vulnerable to exploitation, coercion,\nand duress.\nNo MC apply under this guideline.  Applicant engaged in a continued course of illegal\nconduct while in a position of authority that allowed her to steal controlled substances from her\nemployer to feed her drug abuse problem.  The trustworthiness concern under the personal conduct\nguideline is met by the totality of Applicant\u2019s misconduct when she was a pharmacist in charge and\nstole drugs to feed her addiction.  She has not met her burden of proof and persuasion on the facts\nshe submitted in writing.  Therefore, I conclude this concern against Applicant. \nCriminal Conduct Guideline J: The criminal conduct concern is that she was arrested in\nNovember 2003 for stealing vicodin and oxycodine from her employer\u2019s stocks of controlled\nsubstances.  DC 1 (Allegations or admissions of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person\nwas formally charged. E2.A10.1.2.1) and DC 2 (A single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses.\nE2.A10.1.2.2) apply.  Applicant was arrested for taking from her employer controlled medical\n\n8\nsubstances that she needed to feed her drug addiction.\nApplicant has not met her burden of proof and persuasion on this guideline either.  Her\ncriminal conduct remains unresolved by the local prosecutor.  Applicant has the burden of showing\nthe criminal case was resolved and the result.  The conduct is recent, particularly because she\nremains in a rehabilitation mode.  Her pharmacist work history is not long enough or free of\nmisconduct to apply this or any MC here.  These crimes were not isolated.  There is insufficient\nevidence of successful rehabilitation because Applicant has not completed the treatment program\nnor established a significant period of abstinence subsequent to being released from it.  Therefore,\nI conclude no MC apply and conclude this guideline against Applicant.\nWhole Person Concept: The \u201cwhole person concept\u201d looks at the factors listed in paragraph\n3 of the POLICY section of this decision.  I considered Applicant\u2019s age and high level of\nprofessional education.  I considered her misconduct went on for 16 months until her wrongdoing\nwas discovered by her employer.  Applicant is intelligent enough to know that she had an addiction,\nwas committing illegal and untrustworthy acts against her employer and her profession\u2019s standards\nof conduct, but never took action to address her problems until she was caught.  There was great\npotential for pressure, coercion, exploitation and duress while she was stealing the two prescription\nmedicines she needed to feed her addiction.  Applicant has not dissuaded me that there is strong\nlikelihood of recurrence based on the duration of her addiction and the length of time she stole\ncontrolled substances.  Considering all of the factors, I conclude the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d against\nApplicant.\nREMAND FORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.  Guideline H:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2.  Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 3.  Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nREMAND DECISION\n\n9\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for assignment to sensitive duties.\nHer eligibility for assignment to sensitive positions is denied.\nPhilip S.

That favorable finding is not at issue on appeal.\n1\nApplicant\u2019s Brief at 1.\n2\n2\nDecember 27, 2006, after considering the record, Administrative Judge Marc E. Curry denied\nApplicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6\nE3.1.28 and E3.1.30.1\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in concluding\nApplicant\u2019s falsification of his security clearance application was deliberate; whether the Judge erred\nby concluding that the security concerns raised under Guidelines E had not been mitigated.\n(1) Applicant contends that he did not deliberately falsify his security clearance application\nby failing to disclose his 2003 arrest and conviction for Battery Causing Bodily Injury.  The Board\ndoes not find this argument persuasive.\nThe Judge had the opportunity to consider Applicant\u2019s explanation for why he failed to\ndisclose the information in question.  The Judge was not bound, as a matter of law, to accept or reject\nApplicant\u2019s explanation.  The Judge considered Applicant\u2019s explanation in light of the record\nevidence as a whole, and concluded there was a sufficient basis to find that Applicant\u2019s omission was\ndeliberate and intentional.  On this record, the Judge\u2019s finding of deliberate falsification is\nsustainable.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1; ISCR Case No. 04-03849 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jan. 26, 2006).\n(2) In the alternative, Applicant contends that the Judge erred in concluding that the security\nconcerns raised by his falsification had not been mitigated.  In support of that contention, Applicant\nargues that \u201c[he] disclosed all details of [his] arrest to the investigators without provocation.\u201d2\nApplicant\u2019s contention does not demonstrate that the Judge erred.\nThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and whole person factors does not\nturn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the particular facts of a case.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 01-14740 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan.15, 2003).  Thus, the presence of some mitigating\nevidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.  As the\ntrier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable\nevidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the\nJudge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence,\nis not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner\nthat is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nIn this case, the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the\nrecency and seriousness of the disqualifying conduct, and considered the possible application of\nrelevant mitigating conditions.  The Judge reasonably explained why the evidence which Applicant\nhad presented in mitigation was insufficient to overcome the government\u2019s security concerns.  The\nBoard does not review a case de novo.  The favorable record evidence cited by Applicant is not\nsufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 02-28041 at 4 (App. Bd. Jun. 29, 2005).  The security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s\nfalsification were not necessarily overcome by Applicant\u2019s subsequent disclosures to the\n\n3\ngovernment.  See ISCR Case No. 01-19513 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 22, 2004).  Given the record that was\nbefore him, the Judge\u2019s ultimate unfavorable clearance decision under Guideline E is sustainable.\nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge denying Applicant a clearance is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Jean E.

On September 13, 2005, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant\nof the basis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline C (Foreign Preference) and\nGuideline B (Foreign Influence) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\n\nThe Judge found in Applicant\u2019s favor with respect to SOR paragraphs 1.a and 1.b.  Those favorable findings\n1\nare not at issue on appeal.  As part of his appeal, Applicant offers new evidence in the form of additional explanations\nabout his circumstances.  The Board cannot consider this new evidence on appeal.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.  Its\nsubmission does not demonstrate error on the part of the Judge.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-03143 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec.\n20, 2006).\nIn his brief, Applicant states that he originally hired an attorney (other than the two referenced in the text\n2\nabove) who practiced in the area of \u201creal estate and loan closings\u201d to represent him in this case.  However, Applicant\ndischarged that attorney prior to the hearing\u2014apparently because the attorney lacked a sufficient knowledge of security\nclearance process, was too expensive, Applicant had been advised to represent himself by an employee of another\ngovernment agency, and Applicant had \u201c. . . a mistrust of attorneys in general.\u201d  Applicant appeared pro se at the hearing\nand states \u201cI did a poor job of representing myself and I know this.\u201d  Applicant\u2019s Brief at 1, 2, and 6.  The Board has\npreviously noted that a pro se Applicant cannot complain about the quality of self-representation.  See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 03-04779 at 3 (App. Bd. July 20, 2005).\nREDACTED\n3\n \n2\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On August 31, 2006, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge Joan Caton Anthony denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nApplicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge was biased, prejudiced\nor unprofessional; whether the Judge\u2019s adverse credibility determination is sustainable; whether the\nJudge\u2019s adverse clearance decision under Guidelines C and B is arbitrary, capricious or contrary to\nlaw.1\n(1) Applicant essentially argues that the Judge\u2019s adverse clearance decision is unfair because\nthe Judge in his case was tougher than other DOHA Judges.  Applicant does not identify any specific\ncases in which a similarly situated applicant was treated differently or received a different result.\nNor does he point to anything  in the record to support his assertion in this regard.  Rather, Applicant\npoints to the purported statements of two [unnamed] attorneys, experienced with the security\nclearance process,  that Applicant says he had contacted in an effort to secure representation.   The\n2\n3\nBoard construes Applicant\u2019s argument as raising the issue of whether the Judge was biased,\nprejudiced or unprofessional.\nThere is a rebuttable presumption that a Judge is impartial and unbiased, and a party seeking\nto rebut that presumption has a heavy burden of persuasion.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-08032 at\n4 (App. Bd. May 14, 2004).  The issue is not whether Applicant personally believes the Judge was\nbiased or prejudiced against Applicant.  Rather, the issue is whether the record contains any\nindication the Judge acted in a manner that would lead a reasonable person to question the fairness\nand impartiality of the Judge.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-04713 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 27, 2003).\nBias or prejudice is not demonstrated merely because the Judge made adverse findings or reached\nunfavorable conclusions.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 94-0954 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 1995).\nMoreover, even if an appealing party demonstrates error by the Judge, proof of such error, standing\n\nApplicant\u2019s brief raises one other issue.  Applicant asserts that Department Counsel advised him to turn in his\n4\npassport to Iran.  In that regard, he states that although Department Counsel \u201c. . . was aware that I did not want to turn\nmy passport to the Iranian government but told me that I had no choice but to turn it in and advised me to mail in my\npassport to the Iranian Interest Section.\u201d  Applicant\u2019s Brief at 3.  Applicant\u2019s acknowledgment that he did not want to\nsurrender his Iranian passport is not insignificant.  Applicant\u2019s claims regarding Department Counsel are not supported\nby record evidence.  Furthermore, there is a presumption of good faith and regularity.\nIn his brief, Applicant acknowledges the problem raised by his testimony on this issue stating: \u201cThis as much\n5\nas I hate to admit, was mainly due to my own stupidity not because I was trying to hide anything.\u201d Applicant\u2019s Brief at\n2. \n3\nalone, does not demonstrate the Judge was biased or prejudiced.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 98-0515\nat 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 1999).  \nApplicant has not met the heavy burden of persuasion noted above, in that he fails to identify\nanything in the record below that indicates or suggests a basis for a reasonable person to question\nthe fairness, impartiality, or professionalism of the Judge. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-00740 at 2\n(App. Bd. June 6, 2006).  A review of the record indicates Applicant was provided with the\nprocedural rights set forth in Executive Order 10865 and the Directive, and that the Judge conducted\nthe hearing in a professional manner, consistent with her role as an impartial presiding official.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 02-17574 at 2 (App. Bd. July 24, 2006).  A decision by another Hearing Office\nJudge is not legally binding precedent on that Judge\u2019s colleagues in other cases, even if an applicant\ncan establish close factual similarities between the cases.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-04004 at 2\n(App. Bd. July 31, 2006).  Accordingly, the Judge was not legally obligated to reconcile her decision\nin this case with the decisions of her fellow Judges in ostensibly similar cases.  See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 02-24752 at 3 (App. Bd. July 31, 2006). \n(2) Applicant argues that the Judge\u2019s adverse credibility determination with respect to the\nApplicant is unsupported by the record evidence.  The Board does not find Applicant\u2019s argument\npersuasive.\nThe Board\u2019s review of a Judge\u2019s findings is limited to determining if they are supported by\nsubstantial evidence\u2014such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to\nsupport such a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.\n\u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two\ninconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency\u2019s finding from\nbeing supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620,\n(1966).  Although a Judge\u2019s credibility determination is not immune from review, the party\nchallenging that determination has a heavy burden on appeal. See ISCR Case No. 04-00225 at 2\n(App. Bd. Nov. 9, 2006).   After reviewing the record, the Board concludes Applicant has not met\nthat burden.  \nIn this case, the Judge\u2019s adverse credibility determination is predicated on her findings that\nApplicant testified that his Iranian passport had expired in May 2003 and he had not renewed it,\nwhen in fact it had been renewed with an expiration date of May 2008.   Decision at 4.  Those\n4\nfindings are supported by substantial evidence and are sustainable.   In light of the foregoing, the\n5\nJudge\u2019s adverse credibility determination constitutes a permissible interpretation of the record\nevidence and is not arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.\n\n4\n(3) Finally, Applicant argues that the Judge mis-weighed the evidence in this case and that\nher overall unfavorable decision under Guidelines C and B is arbitrary, capricious and contrary to\nlaw.  The Board does not find this argument persuasive.\nThe Applicant has not met his burden of demonstrating that the Judge erred in concluding\nthat the security concerns raised by his foreign ties and connections had not been mitigated.\nAlthough Applicant strongly disagrees with the Judge\u2019s conclusions, he has not established that those\nconclusions are arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.3.\nThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions does not turn simply on a finding\nthat one or more of them applies to the particular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires\nthe exercise of sound discretion in light of the record evidence as a whole.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No.\n01-14740 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan.15, 2003).  Thus, the presence of some mitigating evidence does not\nalone compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the\nJudge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs\nthe unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of\nthe evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to\ndemonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.\nIn this case, the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the\nnature and seriousness of the disqualifying circumstances, and considered the possible application\nof relevant mitigating conditions.  The Judge found in favor of the Applicant with respect to several\nof the factual allegations.  However, the Judge articulated a rational basis for not fully applying any\nmitigating conditions in this case, and reasonably explained why the evidence which the Applicant\nhad presented in mitigation was insufficient to overcome the government\u2019s security concerns.  The\nBoard does not review a case de novo.  The favorable record evidence cited by Applicant is not\nsufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 02-28041 at 4 (App. Bd. June 29, 2005).  Given the record that was before her, the\nJudge\u2019s ultimate unfavorable clearance decision under Guidelines C and B is sustainable.

His February 2008 credit bureau report shows no delinquent\ndebt, one credit card with an $869 balance, one $6,546 auto loan with a $170 monthly\npayment, and two home mortgages totaling $371,000 with monthly payments of $3,550.\nHe has no intention of entering the restaurant business again.  \n5\n\nItem 5 at 23-26; Item 6 at 2.\n6\nItem 5 at 20-22; Item 6 at 2.\n7\nItem 5 at 17-19; Item 6 at 3.\n8\nItem 5 at 13-16; Item 6 at 3.\n9\nItem 5 at 9-11; Item 6 at 3.\n10\nItem 5 at 5-8; Item 6 at 3.\n11\nItem 5 at 1-3; Item 6 at 3.\n12\n3\nApplicant filed his 2000 federal income tax return on September 25, 2002, after\nreceiving an extension of his filing deadline until August 15, 2001. He filed his 2000\nstate income tax return, that was due on April 15, 2001, on February 10, 2003. He\nfinally resolved all federal and state taxes, penalties and interest due for 2000 in\nOctober 2004.6\nApplicant admitted, and IRS records reflect, that he has not yet filed his federal\ntax return for tax year 2001. He filed his state income tax return for that year, due April\n15, 2002, on April 28, 2006. He has not yet addressed his federal return for 2001, but\nfully paid all state taxes, penalties and interest for that year in July 2007.7\nApplicant filed his 2002 federal income tax return on April 28, 2005, and  his\n2002 state income tax return on April 26, 2005. Both returns were due on April 15,\n2003. He finally resolved all federal and state taxes, penalties and interest due for 2002\nin June  2005 and June 2006, respectively.8\nApplicant filed his 2003 federal income tax return on May 23, 2006, and  his 2003\nstate income tax return on April 24, 2006. Both returns were due on April 15, 2004. He\nfinally received refunds for his 2003 federal and state taxes in October 2007 and\nOctober 2006, respectively, with no penalties or interest due for those late filings.9\nApplicant filed his 2004 federal income tax return on December 17, 2007, after\nreceiving an extension of his filing deadline until August 15, 2005. He filed his 2004\nstate income tax return, and paid state taxes due, on time. He finally resolved all federal\ntaxes, penalties and interest due for 2004 in February 2008.10\nApplicant\u2019s 2005 federal and state income tax returns were both timely filed after\nreceiving extensions until October 15, 2006.  Similarly, his 2006 federal and state\n11\nreturns were both filed by the April 15, 2007 deadline.  Accordingly, the allegations in\n12\nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.c are correct, although Department Counsel\u2019s assertion in the\nFORM that Applicant\u2019s federal income tax returns for 2005 and 2006 were also late is\nincorrect and presumably based on his mistaken reading of the evidence rather than\nany attempt to mislead.\n\nItem 2 at 2.\n13\n4\nApplicant has held many positions of significant trust and responsibility on multi-\nmillion dollar projects with his company over the years, with no disciplinary actions in\nconnection with either classified or unclassified work.  He offered no other evidence\n13\nconcerning his character, trustworthiness or responsibility, and I was unable to evaluate\nhis credibility, demeanor or character in person since he elected to have his case\ndecided without a hearing. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\u00b6\n2(a) and 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in\nthe context of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The\nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person,\npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I\nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the\nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the\nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Section 7\nof Executive Order 10865 provides: \u201cAny determination under this order adverse to an\napplicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense\nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nA person applying for access to classified information seeks to enter into a\nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\n\n5\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set\nout in AG \u00b6 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG \u00b6 19(g), \u201cfailure to file annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns as required\nor the fraudulent filing of the same,\u201d is potentially disqualifying. The evidence is\nsufficient to raise this disqualifying condition, requiring a closer examination and\nbalancing of resulting security concerns with any potentially mitigating matters, and\nshifting the burden to Applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate or mitigate those concerns.\nThe guideline includes several conditions that could mitigate security concerns\narising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), disqualifying conditions may be\nmitigated where \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d Applicant\u2019s failures to\ntimely file five years of federal and four years of state income tax returns as required are\nrelatively recent and, for his 2001 federal return, is ongoing. His stated reason was his\ninability to pay required taxes, but at least two of those returns involved refunds.\nFurther, the obligation to properly file tax returns is independent of the ability to pay any\ntaxes owed. Applicant filed timely returns for 2005 and 2006, but has not proven that\nfailure to file is unlikely to recur should he again encounter financial adversity. His\nconduct continues to raise concerns about his reliability, trustworthiness, and good\njudgment. The evidence does not support this potentially mitigating condition. \nUnder AG \u00b6 20(b), it may be mitigating where \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d Applicant attributes his\nfailure to file tax returns to his money-losing restaurant business and resulting debts.\n\nISCR Case No. 06-20964 at 4-7 (App. Bd. Apr. 10, 2008). In this case, the administrative judge found the\n14\nfacts to be insufficient for an adverse determination under Guideline F and the Appeal Board held that\nanalysis of failure to file tax returns under Guideline E was also required.\n6\nLosing money in a business does not alleviate the obligation to file proper tax returns,\nand may indeed lower one\u2019s tax liability. Filing the returns several years late does not\nsupport a conclusion that he acted responsibly under the circumstances.\nEvidence that \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control\u201d\nis potentially mitigating under AG \u00b6 20(c). This mitigating condition is partly raised by\nApplicant\u2019s repayment arrangements and absence of present delinquent debt, but is not\nsupported as a factor for significant consideration in this case because he filed so many\nreturns so late and has still not filed his 2001 federal return. Similarly, AG \u00b6 20(d)\napplies where the evidence shows \u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay\noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d Applicant resolved most of his delinquent\nfederal and state income tax debts, but failure to file timely returns raises concerns\nseparate from the related tax, penalty and interest debts. I conclude this potentially\nmitigating condition has not been established with respect to AG \u00b6 19(g) security\nconcerns.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nAG \u00b6 16 sets forth potentially disqualifying conditions, none of which are\nindependently supported by this record according to their plain meaning. Applicant\u2019s\nrepeated failures to file required tax returns in a timely manner are both sufficient for an\nadverse determination (AG \u00b6 16(c)), and explicitly covered (AG \u00b6 16(d)) under Guideline\nF. To the extent that Appellant\u2019s financial conduct involves questionable judgment, lack\nof candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, however, it\ncan also be considered to support security concerns under AG \u00b6 15.  His pattern and\n14\nrecent history of failure to timely file his federal and state income tax returns\ndemonstrate questionable judgment and unwillingness to comply with rules requiring the\nreporting and satisfaction of one\u2019s tax obligations, thereby raising questions about his\nreliability and ability to protect classified information. For the same reasons discussed\nabove under financial considerations, no personal conduct mitigating condition has yet\nbeen established to fully alleviate such concerns. \n\n7\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature individual who\nis responsible for his choices and conduct. He filed four years worth of federal and state\nincome tax returns from one to four years late, and still has not filed his 2001 federal\nreturn. Applicant submitted only anecdotal evidence of rehabilitation or permanent\nbehavioral change. His recent and ongoing disregard of lawful obligations creates\ncontinuing doubt about his trustworthiness and reliability. The record contains\ninsufficient evidence about his character or responsibility to mitigate these concerns, or\ntending to make their continuation less likely. \nOverall, the record evidence creates substantial doubt as to Applicant\u2019s present\neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude\nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial\nconsiderations and personal conduct. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n8\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \nDAVID M. WHITE\nAdministrative Judge\n",

ABLARD\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nNichole Noel, Esq. , Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant failed to mitigate personal conduct security concerns relating to violation of\nregulations and agreement to refrain from conduct that might create an impression of impartiality\nby attempting to obtain a significant pay increase for a domestic partner and pressuring his employer\nto grant such an increase. He also failed to mitigate security concerns by failing to state on his SF\n86 that he had left his employment after allegations of misconduct as a result of investigation of the\nactions taken to benefit his partner. Clearance is denied. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn April 13, 2007, the Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) pursuant to Executive Order\n\n2\n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry as amended and modified, and\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of\nReasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary\naffirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nor continue a security clearance for Applicant. DOHA recommended the case be referred to an\nadministrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or\nrevoked.\nIn a sworn written statement, received May 11, 2007, Applicant responded to the allegations\nset forth in the SOR, and requested a decision without a hearing. On May 24, 2007 the government\nrequested a hearing to fully develop the record. The case was assigned to me on August 21, 2007.\nA Notice of Hearing was issued August 30, 2007 for a hearing held on September 12, 2007. The\nGovernment introduced ten exhibits in their case in chief and another four in rebuttal. Applicant\nintroduced 47 exhibits. All were accepted into evidence. A government investigator testified for the\ngovernment. Applicant and one witness testified on behalf of Applicant. The witness testified by\ntelephone from another city over the objection of the government. The transcript was received on\nSeptember 20, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant denied with explanation the three SOR allegations of personal conduct security\nconcerns relating to his misuse of his authority as a federal employee and failure to report his\ndeparture from that employment after investigation for misconduct. After a complete review of the\nrecord, I make the following additional findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 36-year-old employee of a major defense contractor working as a program\nmanager since September 2004. Before his present employment he was for 18 months a Navy\nemployee working on Foreign Military Sales (FMS) programs as a federal program analyst. Before\nhis federal employment he worked for another defense contractor for four years as an FMS case\nmanager providing technical support for the FMS work. His domestic partner also worked for the\nsame company. When he took his federal government position he was made responsible for\nmanagement oversight of the work of his former company but in view of possible conflict with the\ninterests of his partner who still worked there, he was restricted pursuant to specific  regulatory\nauthority (5 CFR 2635.502, and SPAWAR Instruction 127521B) from having any authority over his\nwork, promotion, or funding (Exh. 3, p. 7, and Exh.10). \nAs a result of this decision, the supervisory responsibility was divided between Applicant and\na colleague with each having responsibility for four specific personnel in the company. The colleague\nhad exclusive responsibility for oversight of Applicant\u2019s partner. \nDespite the restrictions placed on him and to which he had agreed (Exh. 3, p. 7, and Exh. 5,\np.2), in 2003 Applicant began an effort among his colleagues and supervisors to provide substantial\npay increases for four employees of the company including his partner (Exh. 7). On January 15,\n\n3\n2004, the partner was terminated by the company for lack of performance and was hired by a\ncompetitor company. Ten days later Applicant initiated an effort to terminate the work of the\npartner\u2019s former employer and direct it to his new employer (Exh. 3 p. 20). This was allegedly in\nretaliation for the failure to obtain the pay increases for the four persons (Exh. 3 p. 25). \nAn inspector general\u2019s hotline complaint on January 30, 2004, initiated a lengthy\ninvestigation of Applicant by the Navy Inspector General which was completed on June 1, 2005\n(Exh. 3). He submitted statements to the investigator (Exh. B 9 and 32). The investigation revealed\nthat there was no basis for the action attempted against the partner\u2019s former employer. It concluded\nthat Applicant had broken his agreement to refrain from any supervisory influence over his partner.\nAs a result of the investigation, Applicant was assigned on February 9, 2004, to other work\nfor the Navy in a policy position (Exh. 11, p. 8). He resigned seven months later on September 26,\n2004, and went to work for his present employment the following day. When he filed his application\nfor a security clearance on February 2, 2005, (Exh. 1), he answered in the negative to Question 20\nYour Employment Record relating to leaving a job by mutual agreement following allegations of\nmisconduct, or unsatisfactory performance, or unfavorable circumstances. \nConsideration has been given by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s office to prosecution of Applicant under\n18 U.S.C \u00a7 208 which provides that a federal employee may not participate through recommendation\nin a contract in which he or his spouse has a financial interest. Also considered was prosecution for\nextortion under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 208. Prosecution was declined by the U.S. Attorney for budget\nconsiderations (Report of Adverse Information Exh. 5). \nApplicant has held a security clearance since April 2002. He is well regarded by some\ncolleagues at this former employer and at his present employer (Exh. 42) where he has been\npromoted over the past two years (Exh. B 41). He was interviewed and submitted an eleven page\nstatement to the investigator from the Office of Personnel Management in connection with the\ninvestigation of his security clearance application (Exh. 2). \nThe evidence submitted and testimony by Applicant raised a number of issues, such as\nwhether the pay increases for the four employees were justifiable, the fact that others in addition to\nhis partner were to receive them, the competence of the partner\u2019s employing company, and whether\nApplicant himself might have benefitted from the pay increase for his partner since they shared some\nhousehold expenses. None of those subjects are relevant to the issues raised by the SOR and it is\nunnecessary to rule on them. \n.\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to control access to\n\n4\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position that will give that person access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527.\nAn evaluation of whether the applicant meets the security guidelines includes consideration\nof the following factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and\nmaturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence\nof rehabilitation and other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential\nfor pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\n-------Security clearances are granted only when \u201cit is clearly consistent with the national interest to\ndo so.\u201d Executive Order No. 10865 \u00a7 2. See Executive Order No. 12968 \u00a7 3.1(b).\nInitially, the Government must establish, by something less than a preponderance of the\nevidence, that conditions exist in the personal or professional history of the applicant which\ndisqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information\nSee Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. The applicant then bears the burden of demonstrating it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance. \u201cAny doubt as to\nwhether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved\nin favor of the national security.\u201d -----\u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must,\non the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. See Executive Order No. 12968 \u00a7 3.1(b).\nCONCLUSIONS\nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate\nadjudicative factors, I conclude the following with respect to all allegations set forth in the SOR:\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) are applicable to cases with an SOR dated after\nSeptember 1, 2006. The Government established each of the allegations under Guideline E Personal\nConduct alleged in the SOR Such conduct might indicate questionable judgment, unreliability, and\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations and could indicate that the person may not\nproperly safeguard classified information (AG 15). The specific conditions applicable to this case\nare AG \u00b6 16 d (3) involving rule violations, and AG \u00b6 16 (a) concerning Applicant\u2019s deliberate\nomission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire\nused to conduct investigations or to determine security clearance eligibility. \nMitigating conditions (MC) that might be applicable include under AG \u00b6 17(a) that the\nindividual made prompt, good faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification\nbefore being confronted with the facts, and under AG \u00b6 17(c) if the fact that the offense is so minor,\nor so much time has passed, or happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\nApplicant was well aware of the restrictions placed on him regarding oversight of his partner.\nHe violated those restrictions by seeking to obtain a substantial pay increase for him and then\nretaliating against the partner\u2019s employer when those efforts failed.. He also was aware of the\ninvestigation of his conduct but had transferred to another job for seven months when he resigned\nto take his present position. Apparently he was performing well but was not in a field that he enjoyed\n\n5\n(Exh. 2). He also realized that there would be some \u201cstigma\u201d relating to the events that led to the\ninvestigation and conclusions if he stayed on in his government employment (Exh. 2, p. 8). Thus,\nwhile his departure was his decision and not as a result of his being discharged, it was under\ncircumstances that required it to be reported at Question 20 since he had left his employment after\nallegations of unsatisfactory performance in his former work assignment. No mitigating conditions\napply.\nIn all adjudications the protection of our national security is of paramount concern. Persons\nwho have access to classified information have an overriding responsibility for the security concerns\nof the nation. The objective of the security clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense\nassessment of a person\u2019s trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information. The \u201cwhole\nperson\u201d concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of their acts and omissions. Each\ncase must be judged on its own merits taking into consideration all relevant circumstances, and\napplying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis. \nIn evaluating Applicant\u2019s behavior in terms of the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d(AG \u00b6 2), an\napplicant may mitigate security concerns by demonstrating the factors leading to the violation are\nnot likely to recur(\u00b6 9),), and evidence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes (\u00b6\n6). The incidents that gave rise to this proceeding may not be likely to recur. However, the SOR\nallegations all relate to the security clearance process and his willingness to follow government rules\nthat affect honesty and integrity of the workplace and candor and accuracy in providing responses\nto security clearance applications..  \nAfter considering all the evidence in its totality, and as an integrated whole to focus on the\nwhole person of Applicant, I conclude a security clearance should not be granted to him. \nFORMAL FINDINGS \nFormal findings as required by the Directive (Par. E3.1.25) are as follows:\nParagraph 1. Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or renew a security clearance for Applicant. Clearance\nis denied. \n\n6\nCharles D. Ablard \nAdministrative Judge\n",

Department Counsel submitted the Government's\nwritten case (FORM) on or about February 27, 2007. Applicant filed a response to the FORM on or\nabout March 31, 2007. The case was assigned to me on April 18, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant is a 61 year old employee of a defense contractor.\nApplicant has been experiencing significant financial difficulties since at least 1999. He has\nfiled for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection four times. His first Chapter 13 petition was filed in 1999;\nthe case was dismissed sometime in 2002. His second Chapter 13 petition was filed in September\n2002. It was dismissed in May 2003. His third Chapter 13 petition was filed in September 2004, and\nwas dismissed in August 2005. Applicant\u2019s last Chapter 13 petition was filed in September 2005.\nA repayment plan was approved by the bankruptcy court, and pursuant to that plan, applicant has\nbeen making monthly payments of approximately $800.00 to the bankruptcy trustee since December\n2005. As of August 2006, he had paid the trustee $6,865.45, and had a plan balance of approximately\n$43,884.00. Applicant\u2019s primary reason for repeatedly filing Chapter 13 petitions was to keep his\nhouse out of foreclosure.\nApplicant admits he is indebted as alleged in SOR Allegations 1e through 1o.  These\n1\n\n3\nallegations are therefore incorporated by reference as Findings of Fact. A letter from his bankruptcy\nlawyer (Exhibit 19) states the debts listed in the SOR are part of the current bankruptcy case, and\nwhen the payment plan is completed, these debts will be discharged. Since the bankruptcy schedules\nare not part of the record, this assertion cannot be corroborated.\nApplicant completed and executed an SCA in August 2004 (Exhibit 6). He provided false,\nmaterial information in response to two questions on the SCA. In response to Question 33, he stated\nhe had not filed a bankruptcy petition during the previous seven years In fact, he had filed two\nbankruptcy petitions during that time period. In response to Question 38, he falsely stated that during\nthe previous seven years he had not been over 180 days delinquent on any debt. In a January 2005\nsigned statement he gave to an OPM investigator (Exhibit 9), applicant stated he didn\u2019t include his\nbankruptcies on the SCA because he \u201cdid not think a bankruptcy was relevant.\u201d\nCONCLUSIONS\nWith respect to Guideline F, the evidence establishes that applicant has been experiencing\nsignificant financial difficulties since at least 1999. Applicant\u2019s failure to honor his financial\nobligations  reflects adversely on his judgment and reliability, and suggests he cannot be relied upon\nto safeguard classified information. With respect to the Financial Considerations guideline,\nDisqualifying Conditions E2.A6.1.2.1 (a history of not meeting financial obligations) and\nE2.A6.1.2.3 (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) are applicable.\nOnce the Government established a prima facie case under Guideline F, the burden shifted\nto applicant to show he has reformed. Applicant did not meet his burden. Applicant has made\nsignificant progress with his most recent bankruptcy case, as evidenced by his payment of nearly\n$7,000.00 to the bankruptcy trustee. For this he deserves credit. However, he still owes the\nbankruptcy trustee over $40,000.00, and in view of his previous failures to complete Chapter 13\npayment plans, it is too soon to safely conclude that he will complete this plan and that his financial\ndifficulties are behind him. No mitigating conditions are applicable, and Guideline F is found against\napplicant.\nWith respect to Guideline E, applicant\u2019s falsifications of material facts on the SCA are\ntroubling. The Government relies heavily on the honesty and integrity of individuals seeking access\nto our nation\u2019s secrets. When such an individual intentionally falsifies material facts on an SCA, it\nis extremely difficult to conclude that he or she nevertheless possesses the good judgment, reliability\nand trustworthiness required of clearance holders. Applicant\u2019s intentional falsifications require\napplication of Disqualifying Condition  E2.A5.1.2.2 (the deliberate omission, concealment, or\nfalsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire  . . .). No\nMitigating Conditions apply. Based on the foregoing, Guideline E is found against applicant.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\n\n4\nPARAGRAPH 1: AGAINST THE APPLICANT\nPARAGRAPH 2: AGAINST THE APPLICANT\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for applicant.\nJoseph Testan\nAdministrative Judge\n",

His condition has gone largely untreated. His partially treated anxiety disorder, which is\nstill symptomatic, is a security concern because it compromises his ability to safeguard classified\n\n Executive Order 10865, dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive 5220.6, dated January 2,\n1\n1992, as amended (Directive).\n2\ninformation. Applicant did not present sufficient evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nthe security concern under Guideline I. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny or revoke his eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order and DoD Directive,  the Defense\n1\nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant on\nJanuary 23, 2006. The SOR\u2014which is equivalent to an administrative complaint\u2014details the factual\nbasis for the action and alleges a security concern under Guideline I for emotional, mental, and\npersonality disorders due to Applicant\u2019s obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). In addition, the SOR\nincludes an allegation that Applicant is disqualified, as a matter of law, from having a security\nclearance granted or renewed by the Defense Department under 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986(c)(3), because he\nis mentally incompetent as determined by a mental-health professional approved by the Defense\nDepartment.  \nApplicant replied to the SOR on March 12, 2006, and requested a decision without a hearing.\nThree days later, department counsel exercised their option under the Directive and requested a\nhearing in this case (R. 14). The following year, the case was assigned to me on March 19, 2007.\nThereafter, on April 8, 2007, a notice of hearing was issued scheduling the hearing for May 2, 2007.\nThe hearing took place as scheduled. DOHA received the hearing transcript on May 30, 2007.\nAt Applicant\u2019s request, the record was kept open until May 11, 2007, to allow him to submit\nadditional documentary evidence. He made a timely submission, and those matters were forwarded\nto me by department counsel who voiced no objections. Applicant\u2019s job performance evaluations\nfrom 2002\u20132006 are admitted as Exhibit D.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted the factual allegations set forth in SOR subparagraphs 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, and\n1.d. He did not reply to the allegation under 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986(c)(3) in subparagraph 1.e. Based on the\nrecord evidence as a whole, I find the following facts:\n1.\nApplicant is a 42-year-old man who is a software engineer for a large aviation company.

Two coworkers testified on\nhis behalf and vouched for his suitability for a security clearance. Applicant\u2019s group leader described\nhim as a diligent and hard-working employee. The witness believes Applicant is extremely\nconscientious in handling all materials, including classified information. Applicant\u2019s current\nmanager believes Applicant does a good job and is pleased with his work. He has never seen\nApplicant do anything that would cause him to have concerns about Applicant\u2019s handling of\nclassified information. Both witnesses indicated that they became aware of Applicant\u2019s OCD when\nthey were asked to be witnesses in this proceeding. In addition, Applicant\u2019s former manager vouched\nfor Applicant\u2019s character and integrity (Exhibit B). He has never had any concerns that Applicant\nwas a security risk, he has no reason to question Applicant\u2019s integrity, and he trusts Applicant to do\nthe right thing under every circumstance.\n3.\nTo obtain a top-secret security clearance, Applicant submitted a security-clearance\napplication on June 1, 2004 (Exhibit 1). Other than some foreign travel, Applicant disclosed nothing\nof security significance in the application. By answering \u201cno\u201d to Question 19 about his medical\nrecord, he denied consulting with a mental-health professional or another health-care provider about\na mental-health related condition in the last seven years. \n4.\nIn mid-December 2004, a governmental investigator interviewed Applicant at his place of\nwork as part of the background investigation. The results of that interview are summarized in a\nwritten report (Exhibit 4). In broad terms, the interview covered three areas: (1) Applicant\u2019s previous\nnon-disclosure of his OCD and his seeking out pastoral counseling for the OCD a few times\nannually; (2) rule violations; and (3) mental-health problems. For the first area, Applicant explained\nthat he chose not to disclose his OCD and his pastoral counseling because he was embarrassed by\nit.  \n2\n5.\nFor the second area, Applicant stated that during the last seven years or so, perhaps on a\nweekly basis, he had mishandled classified information by transporting it from a secured safe in one\nroom to another room without completing the security logs and without double wrapping it. He\nwould simply put the classified information in his pocket. He did this because he was busy and no\none knew what was in his pocket. He denied ever misusing or compromising classified information.\nThe special agent who conducted the interview confirmed that Applicant\u2019s actions were technical\nviolations, and that no information was developed showing that classified information was\ncompromised (R. 43\u201344).3\n6.\nFor the third area, Applicant volunteered that he had OCD and sought out help from his\nparish priest and from a licensed professional counselor in November and December 2004. He had\nnot returned to the counselor because he felt that the counselor was not telling him anything he did\nnot already know or that he could learn from reading a book. He explained that his OCD would\nmanifest itself by his obsessing on sin and on a fear of accidentally hurting people. For example,\nwhile driving to work he would visualize hitting a pedestrian. Once he arrived at work, he would\n\n This interim action is allowed under the Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.2.  \n4\n The diagnosis was made under section 300.3 of the DSM-IV-TR, of which I took administrative notice\n5\n(Exhibit 5). \n4\nthen spend time calling local law enforcement agencies to check if there was a hit-and-run accident\nthat day. At work, he would obsess on a thought for 20 minutes to one hour. Neither coworkers nor\nhis wife was aware of his OCD, and he desired that his condition remain a secret.  \n7.\nBased on the investigative interview, the agency requested Applicant undergo a medical\nevaluation by a Defense Department psychiatric consultant.  Applicant consented in October 2005\n4\n(Exhibit 2). \n8.\nApplicant met with a board-certified psychiatrist in December 2005. The results of the\nevaluation were reported to the Defense Department in writing (Exhibit 3). The psychiatrist\ndiagnosed Applicant with OCD with poor insight.  The essential features of OCD are recurrent\n5\nobsessions or compulsions that are severe enough to be time consuming or cause marked distress\nor significant impairment, and that at some point of the disorder the person has recognized that the\nobsessions or compulsions are excessive or unreasonable (Exhibit 5). \n9.\nThe psychiatrist reported that Applicant has, since childhood, experienced intrusive, senseless\nthoughts that preoccupy his time excessively, caused marked distress, and interfere with his ability\nto fully engage in his relationships and his work (Exhibit 3). The nature of his obsessive thoughts\ninvolve scrupulosity, fears of inadvertently harming others, and, most recently, fears of blurting out\nclassified information. His compulsive behaviors included repetitive checking behaviors. She opined\nthat Applicant\u2019s OCD was a longstanding, untreated, chronic mental disorder with a fluctuating but\npersistent course. She also opined that Applicant dramatically minimized his symptoms during the\nevaluation. In concluding her report, the psychiatrist expressed the following concerns about\nApplicant\u2019s OCD:\nUntreated, his persistent repetitive thoughts may impair his judgment or reliability\nbecause they interrupt the normal train of thinking. Furthermore, his inability to\nachieve a sense of certainty between incoming sensory information and internal\nbeliefs\u2014a hallmark of obsessive thinking\u2014may impair his judgment or reliability.\nDoubts about his performance or actions which he is unable to resolve place him in\na vulnerable position to be influenced by others (Exhibit 3 at 2).\n10.\nAfter the evaluation in December 2005, Applicant sought treatment from a behavioral\nmedicine institute (Exhibits A and C). He was seen at the institute by a clinical psychologist and the\ndirector of the anxiety disorders center. They concurred with Applicant\u2019s diagnosis of OCD,  and\nthey assessed him as having good insight. Applicant was first evaluated at the institute in February\n2006, and was then seen for six additional visits between March and June 2006. He was discharged\nfrom treatment due to his report that the OCD symptoms had improved significantly and were no\nlonger interfering in his life. They had no reason to believe that Applicant was a security risk, and\nthat his OCD should not be seen as a career impediment.\n\n Under Fed.R.Evid. 702, a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education\n6\nmay testify in the form of an opinion or otherwise. \n Although the psychiatrist  testified about her opinions, I formed my own independent evaluation of Applicant\u2019s\n7\nOCD and how it affects his suitability for access to classified information. See ISCR Case No. 03-22167 (App. Bd. Dec.\n6, 2006). \n5\n11.\nApplicant does not dispute the OCD diagnosis. Since completing treatment at the institute\nin June 2006, he estimates having obsessive thoughts and checking behaviors on a daily basis (R.\n142\u201343). The nature of his OCD includes obsessive thoughts about hurting others and blurting out\nclassified information, and checking behaviors such as checking the stove and the locks (R. 145).\nHe agrees that scrupulosity is the root of his OCD (R. 145). Several of his coworkers now know\nabout his OCD as does his wife (R. 153\u201354). He considers himself a former sufferer of OCD, and\nhe thinks he can control it on his own (R. 154\u201355).  \n12.\nThe psychiatrist, an active duty Air Force lieutenant colonel, testified at the hearing. Her\nqualifications in psychiatry include being licensed to practice medicine in two states. She is board\ncertified in adult psychiatry since 2000, and board certified in forensic psychiatry since 2001. Before\nher current assignment, she served as a faculty member for four years at a large military medical\ncenter. The witness was qualified as an expert in the field of psychiatry with an emphasis in adult\npsychiatry (R. 51\u201352).  \n6\n13.\nIn her testimony, the psychiatrist reaffirmed her conclusions and opinions stated in her\nDecember 2005 report.   She explained that Applicant\u2019s OCD caused him to have obsessions\n7\ncentered around doubt (R. 58\u201359). Applicant\u2019s prognosis was poor largely due to his inability to\naccept treatment coupled with a longstanding history of symptoms that had been disturbing to him\n(R. 66). She noted that while his OCD is controllable, willpower alone would be insufficient for\nApplicant to control his OCD (R. 70).  Also, she opined that Applicant\u2019s OCD impairs his judgment\nand reliability because the symptoms (the doubts about his performance or actions) could place him\nin a vulnerable position to be influenced or taken advantage of by others (R. 71).\n14.\nOn the issue of mental competence, she opined that Applicant is not so impaired by the OCD\nthat he is incapable of safeguarding classified information (R. 72\u201375, 90). But she also expressed\nthe opinion that, due to the OCD, his ability to safeguard classified information is compromised (R.\n72, 90). \n15.\nHaving had a chance to review Exhibits A and C and listen to Applicant\u2019s hearing testimony,\nthe psychiatrist added the following:\n\u2022\nApplicant\u2019s course of treatment at the institute in 2006 was inadequate for the long-term\nmanagement of his chronic OCD (R. 162\u201363).\n\u2022\nShe upgraded her prognosis from poor to guarded because Applicant initiated treatment and\nparticipated in a brief course of treatment in 2006 (R. 163).\n\u2022\nIf she were seeing Applicant as a patient, she would recommend a course of treatment with\na therapist and a reevaluation with a psychiatrist for a 6 to 12-month period and then assess\nhis response to treatment (R. 163\u201364).\n\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n8\n ISCR Case No. 96-0277 (App. Bd. Jul. 11, 1997).\n9\n ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004).\n10\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n11\n6\nIn addition, she remained concerned because Applicant\u2019s OCD will be relapsing and fluctuating, he\ncontinues to have symptoms, and he reported symptoms as recently as a couple of weeks ago. These\nare the types of symptoms that can be managed with medication and ongoing therapy that incorporate\nthe principles of exposure-and-response prevention that Applicant learned at the institute (R. 164).\n16.\nThe psychiatrist also explained that she is not concerned that Applicant would blurt out\nclassified information (R. 167). Instead, her concern is that due to the OCD, Applicant will be\npreoccupied with such thoughts and will be distressed by it. Her assessment of Applicant\u2019s OCD,\nif he was in a military environment, was that: (1) she would not deploy him because his OCD has\nnot been properly treated and his symptoms are not well controlled; (2) she would not recommend\nthat he remain on flight status; and (3) she would not recommend him for the personnel reliability\nprogram (R. 170-72). The basis for her conclusions is that Applicant has a partially treated mental\nillness that is still symptomatic (R. 172).  \nPOLICIES\nThe Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a person\u2019s\nsecurity clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions\n(MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial\ncommonsense decision based upon consideration of all the relevant and material information, the\npertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-person concept. A person granted access\nto classified information enters into a special relationship with the government. The government\nmust be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in those persons to whom it grants access\nto classified information. The decision to deny a person a security clearance is not a determination\nof an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination that the applicant has not met the strict\n8\nguidelines the President has established for granting eligibility for a security clearance.\nBURDEN OF PROOF\nThe only purpose of a security-clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an applicant.  There is no\n9\npresumption in favor of granting or continuing access to classified information.  The government\n10\nhas the burden of presenting evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been\ncontroverted.  An applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or\n11\n\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n12\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n13\n Department of Navy v.

In addition, an applicant has the ultimate burden\n12\nof persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.13\nNo one has a right to a security clearance.  As noted by the Supreme Court in Department\n14\nof Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations\nshould err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the\n15\nDirective, any doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information\nwill be resolved in favor of protecting national security.\nCONCLUSIONS\n1.\nApplicability of 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986\nIn addition to the typical security concern under Guideline I, the SOR alleges in subparagraph\n1.e that Applicant is statutorily ineligible for a security clearance because he is mentally incompetent\nas determined by a mental-health professional approved by the Defense Department. The federal\nstatute at issue is 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986, the so-called Smith Amendment.16\nIn 2000, a federal law was enacted that prohibited the Defense Department from granting or\ncontinuing a security clearance for any applicant if that person fell into any of four categories. The\ncategory at issue here is \u00a7 986(c)(3) dealing with a person who is mentally incompetent as\ndetermined by a mental-health professional approved by the Defense Department. In enacting the\nstatute, Congress did not define the term mentally incompetent. \nThe Defense Department has provided some guidance in this area. In June 2001, the Deputy\nSecretary of Defense issued a memorandum that provided policy guidance for implementing 10\nU.S.C. \u00a7 986. Attachment 1 to the memorandum was general guidance for implementing the new\nlaw within the Defense Department. The attachment stated that the new law did not change the\nsubstance of Guideline I. Also, it stated that \u201c[a]nyone who is found to be mentally incompetent\n(incapable of safeguarding classified information) by a credentialed mental health professional\napproved by the DoD is not considered eligible for a security clearance.\u201d Based on this guidance, the\nterm mentally incompetent means that a person is incapable, lacks the capacity, or is wholly unable\nto safeguard classified information due to an emotional, mental, or personality disorder or illness.\n\n 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986(d) (2004).\n17\n On September 12, 2006, the Director, DOHA, issued revised Operating Instruction No. 64, which implements\n18\nthe waiver authority. It also addresses an administrative judge\u2019s responsibilities in handling a case under the statute. \n Directive, Enclosure 2, \u00b6 E2.A9.1.2.1. An opinion by a credential mental health professional that the\n19\nindividual has a condition or treatment that may indicate a defect in judgment, reliability, or stability.\n Directive, Enclosure 2, \u00b6 E2.A9.1.2.4. Information that suggests that the individual\u2019s current behavior\n20\nindicates a defect in his or her judgment or reliability. \n8\n \nCongress amended parts of the statute in 2004, but \u00a7 986(c)(3) was unchanged. The statute\nalso authorizes a waiver in a meritorious case if there are mitigating factors.  A waiver of the\n17\nprohibition is permitted for two of the four types of cases covered by the Smith Amendment. A\nwaiver is not authorized in mental incompetence cases under \u00a7 986(c)(3).  \n18\nHere, the government seeks to disqualify Applicant asserting that he is mentally incompetent\nunder \u00a7 986(c)(3). This allegation is unproven. Neither the psychiatrist\u2019s report nor her testimony\nsupport the allegation that Applicant is incapable of or lacks the capacity to safeguard classified\ninformation due to his OCD. Accordingly, I conclude that 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986(c)(3) does not apply here.\n2.\nThe Guideline I Security Concern \nUnder Guideline I, the concern is that emotional, mental, and personality disorders can cause\na significant deficit in a person\u2019s psychological, social, and occupational functioning. These\ndisorders are of security concern because they may indicate a defect in judgment, reliability, or\nstability.\nHere, based on the record evidence as a whole, a security concern is raised due to Applicant\u2019s\nchronic OCD. Applicant has had OCD since childhood, and it has gone largely untreated except for\nbrief periods in 2004 and 2006. The psychiatrist is of the opinion that Applicant\u2019s OCD is serious\nenough that it may indicate a defect in judgment, reliability, or stability. Also, she opined that\nApplicant\u2019s partially treated OCD compromises his ability to safeguard classified information. Given\nthese facts, DC 1  applies against Applicant. In addition, his OCD is not a temporary condition.\n19\nApplicant is still symptomatic as evidenced by his nearly daily obsessive thoughts and checking\nbehavior since June 2006. Given these facts, DC 4  applies against Applicant. \n20\nI reviewed the mitigating conditions (MC) under Guideline I and conclude none apply.\nApplicant has not presented sufficient evidence to justify applying any MC. Although he presented\ninformation (Exhibits A and C) from the people who evaluated and treated him at the institute in\n2006, that information is inadequate. Because these people did not testify at the hearing, their\nassertions and opinions were not subjected to testing and scrutiny via cross-examination. Given these\ncircumstances, I gave the information less weight. In addition, their assertions and opinions are not\npersuasive when compared with the report and testimony from the board-certified psychiatrist. \nApplicant may believe that his OCD is largely resolved, but it is difficult to accept that\nproposition in light of his almost daily symptoms since June 2006. His stated beliefs\u2014that he\nconsiders himself a former sufferer of OCD, and he thinks he can control it on his own\u2014appear to\n\n9\nbe wishful thinking. And, until recently, Applicant has kept his OCD a secret from his wife and\nothers. This indicates that Applicant has been reluctant to come to terms with and address his OCD\nin a serious, comprehensive fashion. \nAlthough he may be able to function adequately in his day-to-day affairs, Applicant is\nseeking to retain access to classified information. The government must be able to have a high degree\nof trust and confidence in those persons to whom it grants access to classified information. And the\ngovernment cannot rely solely on Applicant\u2019s good faith and willpower to address his OCD. What\nis missing here is a long-term track record of treatment and management of his OCD along with a\nfavorable prognosis that his OCD is under control and will remain under control for the foreseeable\nfuture. Applicant\u2019s partially treated OCD, which is still symptomatic, militates against a favorable\nclearance decision because it compromises his ability to safeguard classified information. \nViewing the record evidence as a whole, I conclude Applicant did not present sufficient\nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concern under Guideline I. And\nApplicant did not meet his ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.\nIn reaching this conclusion, I also considered Applicant\u2019s case under the whole-person concept and\nmy whole-person analysis does not support a favorable outcome for Applicant.  \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nHere are my conclusions for each allegation in the SOR:\nSOR \u00b6 1\u2013Guideline I:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs a\u2013d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph e:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nor continue a security clearance for Applicant.

Applicant requested a hearing.  On October\n\nThe Judge found in favor of Applicant under Guideline D.  That favorable finding is not at issue on appeal.\n1\n2\n16, 2006, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Joseph Testan denied Applicant\u2019s request for a\nsecurity clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.1\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in concluding\nApplicant\u2019s falsification of his security clearance application was deliberate; and whether the Judge\nerred by concluding that the security concerns raised under Guidelines G and F had not been\nmitigated.\n(1) Applicant argues that he did not deliberately falsify his security clearance application by\nfailing to disclose two prior felony charges and three prior misdemeanor charges in response to two\ndifferent questions.  In support of that argument, Applicant contends that he did not list the charges\nbecause he was uncertain as to their nature and disposition, and he believed that the government had\nthe information about them already.  Applicant\u2019s argument does not demonstrate that the Judge\nerred.\nThe Judge had the opportunity to consider Applicant\u2019s explanation for why he failed to\ndisclose the information in question on his security clearance application.  The Judge was not bound,\nas a matter of law, to accept or reject Applicant\u2019s explanation.  The Judge considered Applicant\u2019s\nexplanation in light of the record evidence as a whole, and concluded there was a sufficient basis to\nfind that Applicant\u2019s omissions were deliberate and intentional.  On this record, the Judge\u2019s finding\nof deliberate falsification is sustainable.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.   \n(2) Applicant also contends that the Judge erred in concluding that the security concerns\nraised under Guidelines G and F had not been mitigated.  In support of that argument, Applicant\nessentially restates the facts of his case and argues that the Judge incorrectly weighed the evidence,\nby failing to given adequate consideration to the fact that he has held a security clearance for\napproximately 17 years without any problems, and that the disqualifying conduct essentially amounts\nto a number of isolated incidents.  Based upon the record as a whole, Applicant asserts that his\nconduct was not of sufficient seriousness to be of security concern.  Applicant\u2019s arguments do not\ndemonstrate error on the part of the Judge.\nThe Directive presumes there is a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under\nany of the Guidelines and an applicant\u2019s security eligibility.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-22325 at\n3-4 (App. Bd. July 30, 2004).  Security clearance determinations are not limited to consideration of\nwork performance or conduct during duty hours.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-08623 at 5 (App. Bd.\nJuly 29, 2005).  The federal government need not wait until an applicant actually mishandles or fails\nto properly safeguard classified information before it can deny or revoke access to such information.\nSee Adams v. Laird, 420 F.2d 230, 238-239 (D.C. Cir. 1969).  The absence of security violations\ndoes not bar or preclude an adverse security clearance decision. See ISCR Case No. 01-03357 at 4\n(App. Bd. Dec. 13, 2005).\nThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and whole person factors does not\nturn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the particular facts of a case.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 01-14740 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan.15, 2003).  Thus, the presence of some mitigating\nevidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.  As the\n\n3\ntrier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable\nevidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the\nJudge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence,\nis not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner\nthat is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nIn this case, the Judge properly considered the significance of Applicant\u2019s pattern of conduct\nas a whole, rather than analyzing each separate incident in a piecemeal fashion.  See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 04-12648 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Oct. 20, 2006) citing Raffone v. Adams, 468 F. 2d 860 (2  Cir. 1972)\nnd\n(taken together, separate events may have a significance that is missing when each event is viewed\nin isolation).  He reasonably weighed the mitigating evidence against the seriousness of the\ndisqualifying conduct, and considered the possible application of relevant mitigating conditions.  The\nJudge found in favor of Applicant under one of the Guidelines.  However, he reasonably explained\nwhy there was insufficient mitigating evidence to overcome the government\u2019s other security\nconcerns.  The Board does not review a case de novo.  The favorable evidence cited by the Applicant\nis not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 02-28041 at 4 (App. Bd. June 29, 2005).  Given the record that was before him,\nthe Judge\u2019s ultimate unfavorable clearance decision under Guidelines J and E is sustainable.\nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge denying Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Jean E.

On May 11, 2006, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and\n\n2\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a decision on the written record.  On March 26, 2007,\nafter considering the record, Administrative Judge David M. White denied Applicant\u2019s request for\na security clearance.  Applicant filed a timely appeal pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raises the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge erred in concluding that\nhe deliberately provided false answers on his security clearance questionnaire.  Applicant\u2019s brief also\ncontains new evidence, in the form of a letter from Applicant and one from Applicant\u2019s wife, neither\nof which had been previously submitted.  The Board cannot consider this new evidence on appeal.\nSee Directive \u00b6  E3.1.29.\nApplicant contends that he did not deliberately provide false answers concerning his past due\ndebts.  We have examined Applicant\u2019s brief, the Judge\u2019s decision, and the record as a whole.  We\nconclude that the Judge\u2019s findings of deliberate falsification are sustainable.  See Directive\nE3.1.32.1; ISCR Case No. 04-03849 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jan. 26, 2006).  \n The decision of the Judge denying Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED.  \nSigned: Jean E.

Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On July 19, 2007, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Christopher Graham\ngranted Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Department Counsel filed a timely appeal\npursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nDepartment Counsel raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s analysis\nfailed to consider the case in light of the record as a whole; and whether the Judge\u2019s whole person\nanalysis is arbitrary and capricious in that he failed to consider significant contrary record evidence\nand whole person factors.  Finding error we remand the case to the Judge for the issuance of a new\ndecision.\nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Factual Findings\nA.  Facts\nThe Judge made the following findings: Applicant is employed by a federal contractor.\nMarried with two children, he holds a bachelor\u2019s degree and has served in the Coast Guard.\nWhile serving with a police department, Applicant was demoted from police corporal to\npolice officer for having made a false statement to an internal affairs investigation.  Specifically he\ndenied having spoken with another police official about the matter under investigation, although he\nsubsequently acknowledged that he had in fact done so.  He stated that he made the false statement\nto protect the official, whom he subsequently married.  Applicant filed a grievance over the\ndemotion, but his superiors affirmed the decision.\nApplicant received a counseling for failing to complete an accident report.  He had responded\nto an accident and did not obtain local contact information for one of the parties.  He submitted the\nreport without the information, despite having been directed to obtain it by his supervisor.\nApproximately a month after this, Applicant received a \u201csupervisory contact\u201d for improper use of\nsick leave.  The Judge found that Applicant\u2019s supervisor harassed him for reasons connected with\n\u201cracial issues.\u201d   Applicant called in sick because he could not stand the harassment.\n1\nApplicant received administrative discipline for two other incidents, one in which he failed\nto turn in a confiscated license plate, having placed it in the trunk of his police car and then turning\nthe car over to another officer before retrieving it.  On another occasion he received administrative\ndiscipline for having placed a personally owned \u201cblue light\u201d on an unmarked police car, although\nthe police manual permitted the use only of attached equipment.  \nIn 2003 Applicant arrested a suspect for possession of crack cocaine.  The Judge stated that\nthe suspect accused Applicant of using excessive force, which Applicant \u201cvigorously denied.\u201d   The\n2\nJudge went on to find: \u201cThe government alleges that he was investigated by the internal affairs\ndepartment, and it was recommended that he be terminated.  Applicant never received any written\n\nId.\n3\nDecision at 5.\n4\n3\nnotice about the action, his final performance review summary makes not mention of the incident,\nand he would have been entitled to present evidence in his own defense but was never given notice\nof or an opportunity to be heard in connection with any termination proceeding.\u201d   Applicant\n3\nvoluntarily resigned from the police department on March 25, 2003.  \nThe Judge noted in his findings that one of Applicant\u2019s witnesses was a fellow police officer,\nwho testified that the police department had been poorly led, that superior officers would often\nharass subordinates, that punishments were not consistent, and that grievances \u201cwent nowhere.\u201d  \n4\nB.

Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  The Appeal\nBoard may reverse the Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or revoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.32.3 and E3.1.33.3.  \nAs a preliminary matter the Board must address an issue raised on appeal as to whether the\nJudge properly considered the record as a whole.  Although there is a general presumption that a\nJudge has considered all the record evidence, that presumption is qualified.  The qualification is\n\u201cunless the Judge specifically states otherwise.\u201d  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-10950 at 2 (App. Bd.\nJul. 25, 2007).  In this case the Judge comes very close to stating that he has not considered all the\nrecord evidence.\nThe Judge states in Footnote 2 of the Decision: \u201cAfter reviewing the transcript, I have\ndecided to adopt Applicant\u2019s answers to the SOR as the basis for my findings of fact.  His answers\n\n4\nstate the case and present the issues much more succinctly than trying to cobble together gleanings\nfrom the transcript.\u201d  \nThe Board cannot determine with confidence that the Judge has based his decision on\navailable record evidence.  The above quoted language suggests that the Judge may well have\nexcluded relevant evidence, or at least seriously discounted it, without adequate justification.\nFurthermore, Department Counsel correctly notes that in at least one instance, Applicant himself\nacknowledged at the hearing that his answer to the SOR was \u201cwritten incorrectly.\u201d  See Transcript,\nat p.113.  Thus, based on his notion that evidence in the SOR answer was more \u201csuccinct\u201d than\nevidence in the transcript, it appears that the Judge may have failed to consider properly evidence\nthat conflicts with evidence in the SOR answer.  A Judge is required to weigh conflicting evidence\nand to resolve such conflicts based upon a careful evaluation of factors such as the comparative\nreliability, plausibility and ultimate truthfulness of conflicting pieces of evidence.  In this case, the\nJudge may have excluded a large block of evidence solely as a result of his dissatisfaction with the\npresentation of that evidence.  To have done so is error.  In light of this issue it is premature to\naddress any other appeal issue.  The case is remanded to the Judge to issue a new decision in which\nhe evenhandedly considers all record evidence.\nOrder \nThe Judge\u2019s favorable security clearance decision is REMANDED.\n \nSigned: Michael Y.

Billett\nAdministrative Judge\nMember, Appeal Board\nDISSENTING OPINION OF ADMINISTRATIVE JUDGE JAMES E. MOODY\nI respectfully disagree with my colleagues.  I do not interpret the footnote in question as\nconstituting the Judge\u2019s admission that he did not consider the transcript, insofar as he states\nexplicitly that he reviewed it.  I take it to mean that, after his review of the transcript, he concluded\nthat the Applicant\u2019s SOR answers were founded upon substantial evidence. See Directive  \u00b6\n\n5\nE3.1.32.1.  Whether this conclusion is reasonable is a matter that, having been raised by Department\nCounsel, should be resolved by the Board in its exercise of appellate review.  Indeed, whether a\nJudge\u2019s decision reflects a reasonable examination of relevant evidence is one of the criteria which\nthe Board applies in deciding whether a decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See\nISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006).  I would resolve this case on its merits\nrather than remand it.  \nSigned: James E. Moody           \nJames E.

His answers state the case and present the issues much more succinctly than trying to cobble together gleanings\nfrom the transcript.\nId.  at 1, 3; Tr. at 16.\n3\nTr. at 16.\n4\nId. \n5\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn February 28, 2004, Applicant submitted a Security Clearance Application (SF 86).   The\n1\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance\nfor Applicant.  As required by Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within\nIndustry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2,\n1992, as amended, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on February 10, 2006, detailing the\nbasis for its decision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the\nDirective.  The President issued revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) on December 30, 2005.  DoD\nimplemented them on September 1, 2006.  Pending official amendment/reissue of DoD Directive\n5220.6, the AG are to be used in all cases when the SOR is dated on or after September 1, 2006.\nBecause the SOR was dated before September 1, 2006, DOD policy requires that this case proceed\nunder the former guidelines. \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on March 27, 2006, and elected to have a hearing\nbefore an administrative judge.  The case was assigned to me on March 22, 2007, and a Notice of\nHearing was dated on April 17, 2007.  I convened a hearing on May 17, 2007, to consider whether\nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant's  security clearance.\nThe government offered ten exhibits, marked as Exhibits 1-10.  Applicant offered eighteen exhibits,\nmarked as Exhibits A-R.  The government objected to Exhibit R which was overruled.  The\nremaining exhibits were admitted without objection.  DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on May\n30, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT2\nApplicant admitted the allegations contained in the SOR.  The admissions are incorporated\nherein as findings of fact.  After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and\nupon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact: \nApplicant is a 32-year-old case reviewer employed by a federal contractor.   He is married\n3\nand has two children.   He earned a bachelor's degree.   He served in the United States Coast Guard\n4\n5\n\nGovernment Exhibit 1, supra, note 1, at 5-6, 8.\n6\n4\nReserve from April 1995 to April 2003.  He attained the rank of petty officer third class (E-4), and\nreceived an honorable discharge.  He held a security clearance in the Coast Guard.6\nIn January 2002, Applicant was demoted from police corporal to police officer by a county\npolice department, for making a false statement to an investigator in the course of an internal\ninvestigation of another police officer.  In September 2001, an investigator asked him his knowledge\nof events and conversations that he had with another officer about the investigation.  In October\n2001, the investigator re-interviewed him, and he corrected his misstatement and told the\ninvestigator that he had earlier conversations with a police dispatcher and the police officer under\ninvestigation.  When he made the first statement in September, he was trying to protect the\ndispatcher (now his wife), who had discussed with the incident involving the other police officer\n(who was his neighbor).  Applicant wasn't sure if he was supposed to know about the incident at that\ntime, and attempting to protect the dispatcher got himself in trouble.  He admits what he did was\nwrong.  He was demoted as punishment.  It did not seem consistent with what he had observed as\npunishment for similar conduct within the department, and it seemed harsh to both his attorney and\nto him.  He filed a grievance about it and appealed through the various levels within the county\ngovernment, but the demotion was affirmed.  \nThe  chief of police concluded that the misconduct was not so egregious that Applicant\nshould be fired and that he should be given an opportunity to work harder and use better judgment\nin the future.  The assistant county manager told him that the chief of police recognized his potential\nand concluded that Applicant knew he had made a mistake.  The county manager also reviewed the\nfile.  He noted that Applicant had taken full responsibility for his conduct, and thought about the\nseriousness of his actions, and that he guaranteed that such conduct would not happen again.\nIn May 2002, Applicant received a shift level counseling for failing to complete an accident\nreport.  One of the individuals involved in the accident was from out of town, and Applicant did not\nhave a local number, a cell number, or any other telephone contact information other than his home\ntelephone number.  He was unable to contact the person, because that person had not returned home.\nWhen he told his sergeant that it was impossible for him to get the information for the report, the\nsergeant demanded that he submit the accident report that night with all of the information.  He\nsubmitted the report with the information that he had.  Several days later, he contacted the individual\nfor the remainder of the information, and added it to the report.\nIn June 2002, Applicant received a supervisory contact for improper use of sick leave.\nDuring the period covered by the contact, Applicant was being treated more harshly by his\nsupervisors than others under his supervision.  The supervisor was known by other officers as a man\nwho would single out one person, and \"ride\" that person on every aspect of that person's activities.\nHe would pick one officer, and then another and treat them in this manner, yet there was nothing\nanyone could do as there were racial issues involved.  Applicant admitted that at this time, he tended\nto call in sick when he could no longer stand the harassment.  Notwithstanding, he was still\nconsidered proficient in his duties and was receiving letters of commendation from members of the\ncommunity.\n\nId. at 156-167.\n7\nId. at 168-188.\n8\n5\nIn 2001, Applicant received a supervisory notice (also known as a \"contact card\") for failing\nto turn in property. In the course of towing a vehicle, he removed the license plate and put it in the\ntrunk of the police car so that he could turn it in later.  When he went off duty, he left the license\nplate in the trunk, and turned the car over to the assigned officer, placing  the keys through a mail\nslot.  When the department called him about the license plate, he attempted to contact the assigned\nofficer to retrieve the plate and discovered she was out of town.  The department had to use another\nkey to open the car later that evening.\nApplicant also received a supervisory notice or contact card regarding unauthorized use of\nemergency equipment, because he placed an extra emergency blue light on an unmarked police car.\nHe had noticed other officers using these extra lights on unmarked cars to make them more visible.\nHe purchased his own personal \"blue light\" and used it when he made traffic stops in an unmarked\nvehicle so that the stopped police car would be more visible, and thus safer for other drivers.  The\ndepartment manual only permitted use of attached equipment, which his was not, so he stopped using\nit.\nIn January 2003, Applicant arrested a person for possession of crack cocaine.  The suspect\nstated that Applicant used excessive force during the arrest, which he vigorously denied.  The\ngovernment alleges that he was investigated by the internal affairs department, and it was\nrecommended that he be terminated.  Applicant never received any written notice about the action,\nhis final performance review summary makes no mention of the incident, and he would have been\nentitled to present evidence in his own defense, but was never given notice of or an opportunity to\nbe heard in connection with any termination proceeding.  As a result of all this, Applicant submitted\na voluntary resignation from the police department on March 25, 2003.\nIn the spring of 2004, Applicant commenced work for a motorcycle dealer.  He now works\npart-time, mostly selling obsolete parts inventory on e-bay.  As such, he handles thousands of dollars\nin inventory.  The general manager testified that Applicant was honest, had the highest degree of\nintegrity, was reliable, and exercised sound judgment.  Asked if he and would hire him back full-\ntime, he replied \u201cin a heartbeat.\u201d   \n7\nThe program manager (PM) for a company that did background investigations for security\nclearances testified about her observations of Applicant over an 18-month period.  Applicant began\nas a case reviewer, then quickly moved up as an investigator.  The PM said Applicant was person\nof integrity and displayed that characteristic throughout his service with the employer.8\nAn acquaintance of Applicant, who did basic training with him in the Coast Guard, was also\na police officer with the same department as Applicant.  He encouraged Applicant to apply for the\npolice force.  He witnessed the incident with the accident report and said the sergeant was\nunreasonable.  He observed that there was no cohesive leadership management training or\ncompetency among the front-line supervisors.  There was a culture that if a sergeant didn\u2019t like a\nparticular officer, he would harass that officer and the other sergeants would assist in riding the\nofficer.  This \u201criding\u201d of Applicant commenced before the internal affairs investigation incident.\n\nId. at 189-207.\n9\n6\nAfter the incident and Applicant\u2019s demotion, he felt Applicant was frustrated and had not been\ntreated fairly.  It would have done no good for Applicant to appeal his treatment, as the witness had\nseen this treatment of officers before, and grievances went nowhere.  Punishments were not\nconsistent.  They depended on whether you were liked.  The witness left the department two and one-\nhalf years ago, and now holds a Top Secret/SCI clearance.  He believed that Applicant had changed,\nhad become more mature.  He considers him to be a serious person, honest, trustworthy, and knew\nno reason why Applicant should be denied a clearance.9\nPOLICIES\nIn an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s security suitability, an administrative judge must consider\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive, which sets forth adjudicative guidelines.  In addition to brief\nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines are divided into\nDisqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC), which are used to determine an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law.  Instead, recognizing\nthe complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge should apply these guidelines in\nconjunction with the factors listed below.  An administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal\nis a fair, impartial and common sense decision.\nBecause the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept,\u201d an administrative judge should consider all available, reliable information\nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision.\nSpecifically, an administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors\nlisted at Directive \u00b6 E2.2.1: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency\nand recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the\nvoluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nSince the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision\nin each case is arrived at by applying the standard that the issuance of the clearance is \u201cclearly\nconsistent with the interests of national security.\u201d  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those\nconclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence contained in the record.  Likewise,\nI have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d  The\ngovernment initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a potentially disqualifying\ncondition under the Directive.  Once the government has produced substantial evidence of a\ndisqualifying condition, the burden shifts to the applicant to produce evidence and prove a mitigating\n\n\u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion\n10\nin light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.32.1).  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two\ninconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial\nevidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966).  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a\nscintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v.Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4  Cir. 1994).\nth\nSee ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  ?The Administrative Judge [considers] the record\n11\nevidence as a whole, both favorable and unfavorable, [evaluates] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of\npertinent provisions of the Directive, and [decides] whether Applicant [has] met his burden of persuasion under Directive\n\u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006).\nSee ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  The Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence\n12\n \nas a whole, both favorable and unfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent\nprovisions of the Directive, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.15.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006). \n7\ncondition.   Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 provides, \u201cThe applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and\n10\nother evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by\nDepartment Counsel, and [applicant] has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a\nfavorable clearance decision.\u201d  The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the\ngovernment.11\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with\nthe government predicated upon trust and confidence.  It is a relationship that transcends normal duty\nhours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well.  It is because of this special relationship the\ngovernment must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to\nwhom it grants access to classified information.  Decisions under this Directive include, by necessity,\nconsideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information.  Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible\nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nThe scope of an administrative judge\u2019s decision is limited.  Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty,\nand patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings.  Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically\nprovides industrial security clearance decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall\nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  Security clearance\ndecisions cover many characteristics of an applicant other than allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism.\nNothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or\nin part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.12\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe Directive \u00b6 E2.A5.1.1. The Concern: Conduct involving questionable judgment,\nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules\nand regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information. \nThe government established its case under Guideline E.  Personal Conduct Disqualifying\nConditions (PC DC) E2.A5.1.2.1. (Reliable, unfavorable information provided by associates,\n\nDirective \u00b6 E.2.2.1.\n13\nId.\n14\nId.\n15\n8\nemployers, coworkers, neighbors, and other acquaintances), (PC DC) E2.A5.1.2.3. (Deliberately\nproviding false or misleading information concerning relevant and material matters to an\ninvestigator, security official, competent medical authority, or other official representative in\nconnection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination), and E2.A5.1.2.5. (A pattern\nof dishonesty or rule violations, including violation of any written or recorded agreement made\nbetween the individual and the agency) apply in this case.  Applicant admitted his previous conduct\nwith the police department that established a pattern of rule violations.   \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply because none of them are relevant to the issues\nbefore us.  Some of the rule violations are vacuous but typical of bureaucratic agencies that are\ndevoted to rules rather than common sense.  A perfect example is the \u201cblue light.\u201d  Rather than\nreward initiative, the department is more concerned that the light be \u201cattached\u201d instead of concern\nfor safety of its officers or the public.   \nApplicant was a young, immature officer.  I do not doubt for a minute that harassment and\nan oppressive work place environment existed in that police department.  Eyewitness testimony\ncorroborates Applicant\u2019s contentions.  Applicant has finished his college education, gotten married,\nbecome a father, and has excelled with his subsequent employers.  The events raising the security\nconcerns are mostly over five years\u2019 old.  They are not recent and I find that Applicant is\nrehabilitated.  I conclude Guideline E for Applicant.\nWhole Person Analysis\n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.\u201d \u201cAvailable, reliable\n13\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in\nreaching a determination.\u201d   In evaluating Applicant\u2019s case, in addition to the disqualifying and\n14\nmitigating conditions, I also considered the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept in determining Applicant\u2019s risk\nand vulnerability in protecting our national interests.   I considered his age (32), his education, his\n15\nemployment, his military service, and what he has done since the incidents in question.  He has\nmatured, he is now a husband and a father, and he has held two successful jobs since leaving the\npolice force.  The testimony of his fellow officer tells the tale of a police force that is not managed\nprofessionally, where favoritism and harassment of young police officers is de rigeur. \nThis case raises no questions about his reliability and judgment.  He made mistakes but has\nmatured and moved on with his life.  The totality of the record  raises no reasonable and persistent\ndoubts about Applicant's ability to protect classified information and to exercise the requisite good\njudgment and discretion expected of one in whom the government entrusts its interests.  I conclude\nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance.\n\n9\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1. Guideline :\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

Peters, Esquire \n \n \n \n____________________ \n \nDecision on Remand \n____________________ \n \n \nHARVEY, Mark W., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant mitigated security concerns regarding his personal conduct. \nClearance is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn February 28, 2004, Applicant submitted a Security Clearance Application \n(SF 86).1  On February 10, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him,2 pursuant to Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as \namended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, \n \n1Government Exhibit (GE) 1 (Security Clearance Application, Electronic Personnel Security \nQuestionnaire or \u201cEPSQ\u201d, dated February 28, 2004). For convenience, the security clearance \napplication in this decision will be called an SF 86. There is no allegation of falsification of the 2004 SF \n86.   \n \n2Appellate Exhibit (App. Ex.) II (Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated Feb. 10, 2006). App. Ex. II \nis the source for the facts in the remainder of this paragraph unless stated otherwise. \n \nMarch 6, 2008\n\n \n \n2\n                                                          \n1992, as amended, modified and revised.3 The SOR alleges security concerns under \nGuideline E (Personal Conduct). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not \nmake the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for him, and \nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance \nshould be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n \nIn an answer dated March 27, 2006, and received at DOHA on March 30, 2006, \nApplicant responded to the SOR allegations, and elected to have his case decided at a \nhearing.4 The case was assigned to Judge Graham on March 22, 2007.  Judge \nGraham held a hearing on May 17, 2007.  At the hearing, the Government did not \npresent any witnesses (transcript or record (R.) 14). Applicant presented four \nwitnesses. The Government offered ten exhibits (GE 1-10; R. 13-14), and Applicant \noffered 18 exhibits (AE A-R).  \n \nProcedural Issues \n \nThe Government objected to consideration of AE R5 because OPM\u2019s opinion \nthat there were no security issues is not relevant (R. 88-90). Judge Graham overruled \nthe Government objection, indicating it would be considered for a limited purpose due \nto its low relevance (R. 90-91). I will not consider AE R for any purpose. At most AE R \nestablishes that OPM conducted an investigation, and did not note any significant \nsecurity issues. However, OPM did not render an opinion about the allegations in the \nSOR. Because the scope and quality of the OPM investigation was not presented, the \nrelevance of OPM\u2019s determination is too low to warrant admission into evidence.   \n \nThe Government objected to consideration of one letter in AE D because it was \nduplicated (R. 32-33). Judge Graham admitted both copies because two offices sent \nthe letters to Applicant on different occasions (R. 33). I will only consider one copy of \nthe letter, but I will not remove the letter from AE D. \n \nAll other exhibits were admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript \non May 30, 2007. Judge Graham issued his decision granting a clearance on July 19, \n2007. \n \n \n \n3On Aug. 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a memorandum \ndirecting application of revised Adjudicative Guideline to all adjudications and other determinations \nmade under the Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security \nProgram (Regulation), dated Jan. 1987, as amended, in which the Statement of Reasons (SOR) was \nissued on or after Sep. 1, 2006. The revised Adjudicative Guidelines are not applicable to Applicant\u2019s \ncase because the SOR, is dated Feb. 10, 2006, which is prior to Sep. 1, 2006. \n \n4App. Ex. IV (Applicant\u2019s response to SOR, dated Mar. 27, 2006).  \n \n5 AE R is an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) document indicating that as of August 29, \n2005, the OPM investigation was complete and closed. The one-page document does not cite any \nsecurity issues concerning Applicant\u2019s background. \n \n\n \n \n3\n                                                          \nAppellate Litigation \n \nThe Government appealed Judge Graham\u2019s decision.6 On November 14, 2007, \na majority of the Appeal Board remanded Applicant\u2019s case for a new decision. The \nAppeal Board highlighted footnote 2 of Judge Graham decision: \n \nAfter reviewing the transcript, I have decided to adopt Applicant\u2019s \nanswers to the SOR as the basis for my findings of fact. His answers \nstate the case and present the issues much more succinctly than trying \nto cobble together gleanings from the transcript.  \n \nISCR Case No. 05-06723 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Nov. 14, 2007). \n \nJudge Graham\u2019s decision cited to the transcript eight times. Moreover, the only \nrecord source for his summaries of supervisory recommendations, and the \ndescriptions of the problems in the police department are from witnesses\u2019 statements \nat the hearing. The Appeal Board describes Department Counsel\u2019s citation to contrary \nfacts not mentioned in Judge Graham\u2019s decision; however, the Appeal Board did not \ncite any evidence not discussed by Judge Graham that is material, and contrary to \nJudge Graham\u2019s factual findings. Id. at 2-3. It would have been helpful if the Appeal \nBoard had articulated the particular facts, conflicting with Judge Graham\u2019s decision, \nrequiring consideration or discussion in the remand decision. The Appeal Board \nelaborated upon Judge Graham\u2019s error: \n \nThus, based on his notion that evidence in the SOR answer was more \n\u201csuccinct\u201d than evidence in the transcript, it appears that the Judge may \nhave failed to consider properly evidence that conflicts with evidence in \nthe SOR answer. A Judge is required to weigh conflicting evidence and \nto resolve such conflicts based upon a careful evaluation of factors such \nas the comparative reliability, plausibility and ultimate truthfulness of \nconflicting pieces of evidence. In this case, the Judge may have \nexcluded a large block of evidence solely as a result of his dissatisfaction \nwith the presentation of that evidence. To have done so is error. \n \nId. at 4. \n \nThe Appeal Board remanded Applicant\u2019s case \u201cto issue a new decision in which \nhe evenhandedly considers all record evidence.\u201d Id. I will not restate or rely on Judge \nGraham\u2019s findings or conclusions in the Findings of Fact, Analysis or the Formal \nFindings sections of this decision, and will issue a de novo opinion.7 \n \n6The briefs filed by the parties were not part of the file provided to me.  I recommend that briefs \nof counsel filed with the Appeal Board be routinely provided to those judges who conducted the hearing \n(who so request), as is the practice at other U.S. civil and military courts.   \n \n7 The Supreme Court in United States v. Raddatz, 447 U.S. 667, 690 (1980) succinctly defined \nthe phrase \"de novo determination\": \n \n\n \n \n4\n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n \nOn February 5, 2008, Applicant waived his right to a re-hearing, and elected a \ndecision based on the existing record (App. Ex. V). The Government did not request a \nre-hearing.  I approved the request to decide the case based on the transcript and \nadmitted exhibits, as described above. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted most of the SOR allegations in his response to the SOR and \nat his hearing. His response to the SOR also provided mitigating information \nconcerning the SOR allegations. His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of \nfact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the \nfollowing findings of fact.   \n \n \nApplicant was born in April 1975 (R. 16). His current employment is to review \nbackground investigations for a federal contractor. He married in August 2003 (R. 16, \n64). His wife works at the police department, where Applicant was employed from \n1999 to 2003 (R. 64). She is now a supervisor (R. 64). He has a 10-year-old \nstepdaughter, and an 18-month-old son (R. 16). In 2003, he earned a bachelor's \ndegree (R. 16). He joined the Coast Guard in 1995 (R. 17). During his Coast Guard \nservice he was trained in port security (R. 18). He left active Coast Guard service in \nDecember 1998 and obtained employment with a police department (R. 19). He went \nfrom active reserves to inactive reserves in April 2001 (R. 57). He attained the rank of \npetty officer third class (E-4) (R. 57). He held a security clearance in the Coast Guard. \nHe was Honorably Discharged from the Coast Guard Reserve on March 4, 2003 (AE \nE). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s police employment was primarily patrol duties (R. 21). He \nsuccessfully completed his probationary training, and received a satisfactory appraisal \non May 17, 2000 (R. 23-24; AE A).  On June 21, 2000, he was nominated, but was not \nawarded an outstanding job performance award (R. 24, 27; AE C). His appraisal after \nhis first year was satisfactory (R. 25-27; AE B).  He received 20 letters of appreciation, \nmostly from citizens in the community, for his performance as a patrol officer (R. 28; \nAE D). He was promoted from Police Recruit, to Police Officer I, to Police Officer II, \nand then to Corporal in Mid-2001 (R. 34-35).  \n \n \n \n \n[This legal term] has an accepted meaning in the law. It means an independent \ndetermination of a controversy that accords no deference to any prior resolution of the \nsame controversy. Thus, in Renegotiation Board v. Bannercraft Clothing Co., 415 U.S. \n1, 23 [(1974)], the Court had occasion to define \u201cde novo proceeding\u201d as a review that \nwas \"unfettered by any prejudice from the [prior] agency proceeding and free from any \nclaim that the [agency's] determination is supported by substantial evidence.\" And, in \nUnited States v. First City National Bank, 386 U.S. 361, 368 [(1967)], this Court \nobserved that \"review de novo\" means \"that the court should make an independent \ndetermination of the issues\" and should \"not . . .  give any special weight to the [prior] \ndetermination of\" the administrative agency.  \n \n(footnotes omitted). \n\n \n \n5\n                                                          \nFalse statement in internal affairs investigation (SOR \u00b6 1.a) \n  \nIn September 2001, a female police officer (A) and her female roommate (V) \nwere involved in an altercation (R. 36). A drew her weapon on V and told V to get \naway (R. 36). V left their apartment, called the police dispatcher (D), and told D that A \ndrew her weapon on her (R. 36). V asked D for advice about what she should do (R. \n36). Applicant lived near V and A, and Applicant and A were friends (R. 37-38). D and \nApplicant were friends and eventually married each other (R. 37). D told Applicant \nabout the incident between A and V (R. 37). Later, D\u2019s supervisor told D not to discuss \nthe incident (R. 39). D told Applicant about the directive from her supervisor, and \nasked him not to reveal their conversation or spread rumors (R. 39). D did not tell him \nto lie to internal affairs (R. 145-146). When Applicant was questioned by internal affairs \nabout the incident, he denied discussing it with anyone (R. 39).8 Internal affairs \nconfronted D and Applicant about their discussion, and Applicant admitted lying about \nnot discussing the incident (R. 40). D did not lie to internal affairs (R. 145-146). D was \nsuspended for two days (R. 40). \n \nOn December 28, 2001, Applicant was demoted from Corporal to Police Officer \nII (R. 40, 98-100).9 He appealed the demotion because he believed a minor \nsuspension or a loss of 40 hours\u2019 leave was the usual punishment for the offense (R. \n53-54, 109).  \n \nThe chief of police concluded that the misconduct was not so egregious that \nApplicant should be fired and recommended he should be reduced in rank from \nCorporal (pay $22.57/hr) to Police Officer II (pay $21.01/hr) (GE 3). The assistant \ncounty manager affirmed the demotion, but noted that Applicant had taken full \nresponsibility for his misconduct, recognized the seriousness of his falsification, and \nguaranteed that such conduct would not happen again (GE 6).   \n \nIn sum, he lied to protect a friend, D, and not with the intent to obstruct the  \ninvestigation of the assault by the police officer (R. 145). He recognized his lie to \ninternal affairs was \u201cstupid\u201d and wrong (R. 144, 42). He learned from his mistake (R. \n144), and promised that he would not lie in the future (R. 42). \n \nInsubordination (SOR \u00b6 1.b) \n \nIn May 2002, Applicant received a shift-level counseling or contact card for \nfailing to complete an accident report, as Sergeant B, his supervisor specified (R. 43-\n \n8The information about D\u2019s conversation with Applicant was collateral to the Internal Affairs\u2019 \ninvestigation because the dispatcher tapes tape recorded D and V\u2019s conversation (R. 39).  Applicant \nand D were not eyewitnesses to the assault.  Applicant did not interview or discuss the assault with the \nparticipants of the assault.  \n \n9The police department notified Applicant he was demoted because he \u201cviolated administrative \nregulations and/or department rules, regulations and/or procedures when [he] lied during an Internal \nAffairs investigation\u201d (R. 101; GE 3).  \n \n\n \n \n6\n                                                          \n47; 103-106).10 One of the individuals involved in the accident was from out of town, \nand Applicant failed to ask for a local telephone number, a cell number, or any other \ntelephone contact information other than his out-of-state, home telephone number (R. \n43-45; 104). He was unable to contact the person, because that person had not \nreturned home (R. 43-45). \n \nApplicant told Sergeant B, his supervisor, that it was impossible for him to get \nthe information for the report that evening. Sergeant B demanded that he submit the \naccident report that night with all of the information, and that he should remain at the \npolice station until the report was completed (R. 45). Applicant asked to see the Watch \nCommander to protest Sergeant B\u2019s order (R. 45). Sergeant B opined that the Watch \nCommander would not intervene, and again directed Applicant to fully complete the \nreport and not to leave until the report was done (R. 45-46). Applicant wrote unknown \nin the boxes of the report for the contact information, filed the report with another \nsupervisor (who approved it), and explained he would supplement the report when he \nhad the additional information (R. 45-46). Later, he obtained the remainder of the \ninformation, and filed a supplemental report (R. 46). Applicant contended it was not \nuncommon to file incomplete reports, and then supplement the report later after \nadditional information was obtained (R. 44).11 Sergeant B wrote up a contact card or \nletter of reprimand on Applicant for insubordination because he did not complete the \nreport before going home (R. 47). He did not receive formal disciplinary action, loss of \npay or a suspension (R. 47). The contact card was supposed to be removed from his \nfile after one year (R. 47). The incident involving Sergeant B is documented in \nApplicant\u2019s final evaluation, dated April 9, 2003 (GE 10). \n \nAbuse of sick leave (SOR \u00b6 1.c) \n \nIn June 2002, Applicant received a supervisory contact card or letter of \nreprimand for improper use of sick leave (R. 54-56, 106). After Applicant received the \ndemotion, he was depressed12 and unhappy (R. 54, 110). During the six-month period \nafter the demotion, he called in sick too many times and used too much vacation time \n \n10Contact cards are similar to written counseling statements commonly used in the Department \nof Defense. Contact cards may result from minor rule violations, and do not constitute formal disciplinary \naction (R. 35). They are more serious than an oral reprimand, but less serious than a written reprimand \n(R. 200). They are supposed to be removed from one\u2019s personnel file after one year (R. 35, 200). It is \npossible to received positive contact cards. For example, Applicant\u2019s rating in 2000 notes he received \n\u201cthree positive contact cards.\u201d (AE B at 5). \n \n11 Applicant\u2019s rating for June 6, 1999, to June 6, 2000, resulted in his certification after \nprobation.  In regard to completion of reports and following procedures, it notes: \n \nHis work is complete and contains few errors.  He takes pride in his reports which are \nvery complete and contain much detail . . . [He] complies with Departmental Manual \nand Section Policies. [He] projects himself as a confident and professional officer. He \nalways follows supervisory direction and readily seeks clarification if unsure. \n \nAE A at 4.  \n \n12 He self-diagnosed himself as \u201cdepressed\u201d (R. 106-107). He did not seek a professional \ndiagnosis for his mental or emotions state (R. 106-107). \n\n \n \n7\n                                                          \n(R. 54). The reprimand required him to provide a doctor\u2019s note when he was absent \ndue to being sick, and a particular supervisor had to approve his leave (R. 55).  After \nreceipt of the reprimand, he was very cautious about using sick leave (R. 56). The \nabuse of sick leave was also documented on his performance evaluation (R. 107-108).  \nHe did not appeal the contact card or letter of reprimand (R. 109). \n \nThe contact card refers to ten examples of abuse of sick leave in a four month \nperiod, as well as use of over 400 hours of sick leave in the past twelve months.  This \ndereliction was noted in Applicant\u2019s final evaluation (GE 10).  \n \nFailure to turn-in license plate (SOR \u00b6 1.d) \n \nBetween December 2000 and the end of 2001, Applicant received a \nsupervisory contact card for failing to turn in a license plate that he seized from a \nprivately owned vehicle (R. 48-51; 114-117). Applicant had a part time, off-duty job \nproviding security at an apartment complex (R. 48). He noticed a license plate on a \nvehicle, and determined it did not belong on the vehicle (R. 48). He removed the \nlicense plate and put it in the trunk of a police car so that he could turn it in later (R. \n49). When he went off duty, he left the license plate in the trunk, and turned the police \ncar over to the assigned officer, placing the keys through a mail slot (R. 49). Later, the \ndepartment discovered the license belonged on the vehicle, and the vehicle was towed \nin error (R. 50). When the department called him about the license plate, he attempted \nto contact the assigned officer to retrieve the plate, but could not reach her (R. 50). \nThe department had to use another key to open the police car to retrieve the license \nplate (R. 50). The issuance of the contact card was noted in his performance appraisal \nof March 2002 (R. 115-117).  \n \nUse of privately-owned emergency light (SOR \u00b6 1.e)  \n \nApplicant also received a supervisory contact card regarding unauthorized use \nof emergency equipment, because he used an extra emergency blue light on his \nunmarked police car (R. 51-52, 117-118).13 \n \nApplicant had noticed other officers, including a sergeant, using an extra blue \nlight on unmarked cars to make them more visible (R. 52). He purchased his own \npersonal \"blue light\" and used it when he made traffic stops in an unmarked vehicle so \nthat the stopped police car would be more visible (R. 51). He believed use of his \u201cblue \nlight\u201d added safety for himself and other drivers (R. 51). The department manual only \npermitted use of attached equipment, and his blue light was not attached to the vehicle \n(R. 52). After he received the contact card, he threw the blue light away to avoid any \npossibility that he would be accused of using it again (R. 52). \n \n \n \n \n \n13 His 2000 performance evaluation notes Applicant \u201cconducts himself in a safe manner. He \nproperly utilizes available safety equipment.\u201d AE B at 8. \n\n \n \n8\nSlapping a suspect (SOR \u00b6 1.f) \n \nIn January 2003, Applicant arrested a person for possession of crack cocaine \n(R. 58). Applicant, another officer, the suspect, and the suspect\u2019s family member were \nin the same room of the suspect\u2019s apartment (R. 58). Applicant described the incident \nas follows: \n \nI was standing next to the [suspect] (who was restrained). I had an officer \nstanding behind me and a family member sitting across the room from \nme. While I was trying to speak to the family member to obtain what \nhappened, the [suspect] was becoming very unruly, very loud. I turned to \ntell the [suspect] to quiet down. At which point when I turned, the back of \nmy hand touched the back of his head. There was no physical injury.  \n \n(R. 58). The suspect started screaming about being hit, and the family member \naccused Applicant of striking the suspect (R. 58). As Applicant walked out of the \nbuilding, the other officer made a remark about the possibility of a complaint, and \nApplicant responded along the lines of he did it because \u201cthe guy would not shut up\u201d \n(R. 59).   \n \nInternal Affair Investigation and Police Department Resignation (SOR \u00b6 1.g) \n \nIn February 2003, Applicant was advised of his rights in connection with an \ninternal affairs investigation for slapping the suspect (R. 129; GE 8). Applicant \nadmitted to internal affairs that he touched the suspect with the back of his hand, but \ndenied that he intentionally struck the suspect (R. 60).  \n \nApplicant learned that the internal affairs investigation about striking the suspect \nwas going to have an unfavorable result, and knew that he could be fired (R. 60). His \nchain of command informed him they were making a recommendation to the chief to \ndiscipline him, and one option would be to fire him (R. 119-121). He could not afford a \ngood lawyer, and did not believe the free lawyer assigned to defend police officers was \ncompetent (R. 61). Although Applicant was generally aware of his appellate rights, he \nnever received any written, formal notice about the action to terminate his employment \nor his appellate rights (R. 118, 125-127). After he resigned, he received his final \nperformance review summary, which stated the process of termination was initiated \n(R. 63, 122). Applicant submitted a voluntary resignation from the police department at \nthe end of March 2003 (R. 64; GE 9). At the time his resignation was approved, he \nwas unsure about whether the internal investigation about slapping the suspect was \ncompleted (R. 123).    \n \nPost-Police Department Education, Employment and References \n \nAfter leaving the police force, Applicant returned to college and earned his \nbachelor\u2019s degree in May 2003 (R. 64). He married on August 3, 2003 (R. 64). He \nworked several part time jobs and he was responsible for child care, while he \nsearched for a job (R. 64-65, 139).   \n\n \n \n9\n                                                          \n \nIn April 2004, he began working in the parts department of a large motorcycle \ncompany (R. 65). He currently handles internet sales on a part-time basis for the same \ncompany (R. 66). He is so trusted that he is permitted to keep about $10,000 in \nmerchandise at his residence, which permits him to perform his duties while at home \n(R. 66-67). Applicant received pay raises and very favorable appraisals from the \nmotorcycle company (R. 68-73; AE F, G). He also received a monetary award based \non customer satisfaction in October 2005 (R. 74; AE I). His general manager said (R. \n156-167) that he supervises about 70 employees, and has known Applicant for about \nthree years (R. 157, 165). He described Applicant as honest, reliable, and trustworthy \n(R. 158-161, 166; AE G, H). He has high integrity, exercises sound judgment, and \nscrupulously follows all rules (R. 158-161, 167). If Applicant requested, he would hire \nApplicant back fulltime without any hesitation (R. 162). \n \n \nFrom October 2005 to May 2007, Applicant was employed in a part-time job \nperforming background investigations for the federal government (R. 75-76).14 In \nOctober 2006, he received a promotion to supervisor (R. 76-77, 80-81; AE L). In \nJanuary 2007, he was moved because of changes in his employer\u2019s contract with the \ngovernment (R. 84; AE. N). His performance appraisals documented his diligence, \nreliability and leadership (R. 77-79, 81-82; AE J, K, M). He received a $200 award on \nMarch 8, 2007 for his hard work (R. 84-85; AE O).    \n  \nApplicant\u2019s current employment for a defense contractor involves reviewing and \nassigning cases for background investigations (R. 95-96). He answers questions about \nthe requirements to complete an adequate investigation (R. 96). After the investigators \ncomplete their reports, he reviews the report to ensure it is thorough, complete and in \nthe correct format (R. 96). He intended to continue his employment with the contractor, \nand seek greater responsibility and supervisory authority (R. 97). \n \nA deputy program manager and program manager (PM) for a company that did \nbackground investigations for security clearances described Applicant\u2019s performance \nover an 18-month period as a case reviewer (R. 168-188; AE K, AE M). Applicant \nbegan as a case reviewer, then he became a field investigator (R. 169-170). Later, he \nwas promoted to Deputy Field Operations Manager (R. 179-180). She rated him as an \nabove average employee and supported a performance increase for Applicant (R. \n178-179). At the end of his employment, he received a monetary award (R. 181-182; \nAE O). The PM said Applicant was good at following the rules (R. 172). He is hard \nworking, intelligent and honest (R. 174). He has integrity and displayed that \ncharacteristic throughout his service with the employer (R. 172).  She emphasized his \n \n14 Applicant disclosed in response to Question 20 on his 2004 security clearance application \nthat he left a job under other than favorable circumstances, and mentioned an internal affairs \ninvestigation (R. 135, GE 1). He said he resigned from the police force in 2003 based upon a false \ncomplaint and a previous disciplinary issue, which had damaged his credibility (R. 135; GE 1). He listed \nthree other reasons for resigning: (1) to obtain better employment; (2) to finish school, and (3) to avoid \nthe delay and expense of litigation (R. 135, GE 1).  He did apply for another police department job after \nresigning in order to support his family (R. 138), but the application was unsuccessful.  At his hearing, \nhe maintained that he accurately disclosed his reasons for leaving the police department. \n\n \n \n10\ngood judgment, integrity and maturity (R. 175-176, 187-188).  She would hire him \nagain (R. 183). \n \nA program manager for a Homeland Security contractor, Mr. A, made a \nstatement on Applicant\u2019s behalf (R. 189-207). Mr. A currently has a Top Secret \nclearance with SCI access (R. 202). Mr. A left the police department (where he worked \nwith Applicant) about 2 \u00bd years ago with the rank of corporal (R. 201, 203). Mr. A was \ndeployed to Iraq when Applicant left the police department in 2003 (R. 204). Mr. A has \nknown Applicant for 12 years (R. 189). They met in Coast Guard basic training (A \nSchool) (R. 190). They subsequently served together in a Coast Guard port security \nunit (R. 190). Mr. A joined a police department, and encouraged Applicant to take a job \nwith his department (R. 191-192). Mr. A acted as a mentor for Applicant at the police \ndepartment (R. 196), and he described Applicant as a good police officer (R. 192-193). \nMr. A witnessed the incident with Sergeant B, involving completion of the accident \nreport, and opined that Sergeant B\u2019s demand was unreasonable (R. 193-194). \nApplicant thought his demotion was unfair, and became frustrated with his work in the \npolice department (R. 197). Mr. A described Applicant as being honest, trustworthy, \nnon-violent, serious and mature (R. 202). Applicant is more serious and mature now \nthan he was when he worked at the police department (R. 202).   \n \nMr. A was unable to \u201cdiscern any cohesive leadership[,] management training or \ncompetency amongst the front-line supervisors\u201d at the police department (R. 195). \nThere was a culture that if a sergeant didn\u2019t like a particular officer, the other sergeants \nwould harass or ride the officer (R. 195, 206-207). In addition to Applicant, other, very \ngood officers were the victims of this unprofessional treatment by the sergeants (R. \n195). This \u201criding\u201d of Applicant began before the first internal affairs investigation (R. \n196). Punishments for infractions were inconsistent, and upper level management \nwould not address complaints of supervisor abuse (R. 198-199). There was high \nturnover of police officers at the department (R. 205). Mr. A was never the victim of \nharassment at the police department (R. 207).  \n \nConclusion \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s family is aware of his problems in the police department, and he had \ninformed others with the need to know, such as some of his employers, about his past \nemployment problems (R. 147). Not all of his supervisors are aware of his problems in \nthe police department (R. 148). He recognized that his integrity and reputation were \nvery important, and thought he was now much more mature than when he worked for \nthe police department (R. 93). He changed after he left the police department, and \ncharacterized his poor decisions as a police officer from 2001 to 2003 as \u201cstupid \nmistakes\u201d (R. 93-94). He said he would not make such mistakes in the future (R. 93-\n94). His family is his supportive network now (R. 152). He now faces problems head \non, and admits his mistakes, and asks supervisors how to take corrective action (R. \n151). He emphasized his more recent performance appraisals as proof he had \nchanged (R. 94). \n \n \n\n \n \n11\n                                                          \nPolicies \n \n \nIn an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s security suitability, an administrative judge \nmust consider Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which sets forth adjudicative guidelines. In \naddition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative \nguidelines are divided into Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions \n(MC), which are used to determine an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \n \nThese adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge should apply \nthese guidelines in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process \nprovision in Section E2.2, Enclosure 2, of the Directive.  An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \n \nBecause the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d an administrative judge should consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. \n \nSpecifically, an administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at Directive \u00b6 E2.2.1: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of \nthe conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and \nmaturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the \npresence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well \nas those which could mitigate security concerns, pertaining to the relevant adjudicative \nguidelines are set forth and discussed in the Conclusions section below. \n \nSince the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the \nfinal decision in each case is arrived at by applying the standard that the issuance of \nthe clearance is \u201cclearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d In reaching \nthis decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and \nbased on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing \ninferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.15 The government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish \n \n15 \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as \nadequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-\n11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cThis is something less than the weight \nof the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not \nprevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Consolo v. Federal Maritime \n\n \n \n12\n                                                                                                                                                                                       \na case which demonstrates, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to \nclassified information. Once the government has produced substantial evidence of a \ndisqualifying condition, the burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence and prove a \nmitigating condition.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 provides, \u201cThe applicant is responsible for \npresenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts \nadmitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).16  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. It is a \nrelationship that transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours \nas well. It is because of this special relationship the government must be able to \nrepose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants \naccess to classified information. Decisions under this Directive include, by necessity, \nconsideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to \nprotect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of \nlegally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise \nof classified information. \n  \nThe scope of an administrative judge\u2019s decision is limited. Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, and patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings.  Section 7 of \nExecutive Order 10865 specifically provides industrial security clearance decisions \nshall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as \nto the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  Security clearance decisions cover many \ncharacteristics of an applicant other than allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism.  Nothing in \nthis Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole \nor in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, \nor patriotism. \n \nAnalysis \n \n \n \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly \nabove, I conclude the following with respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nComm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966). \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a \npreponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \n \n16\u201cThe Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and \nunfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the \nDirective, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.15.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006). \n\n \n \n13\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) \n \n \nUnder \nGuideline \nE, \n\u201c[c]onduct \ninvolving \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations could indicate that [applicant] may not properly safeguard \nclassified information.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E2.A5.l.l.  \n \nThree personal conduct disqualifying conditions (PC DC) could potentially raise \na security concern and may be disqualifying in this case.  PC DC 1 applies where \nthere has been \u201c[r]eliable, unfavorable information provided by associates, employers, \ncoworkers, neighbors, and other acquaintances.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E2.A5.1.2.1. PC DC 4 \napplies when there has been, \u201c[p]ersonal conduct . . . that increases an individual's \nvulnerability to coercion, exploitation or duress, such as engaging in activities which, if \nknown, may affect the person's personal, professional, or community standing or \nrender the person susceptible to blackmail.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E2.A5.1.2.4. A security \nconcern may also result under PC DC 5 when there is \u201c[a] pattern of dishonesty or rule \nviolations.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E2.A5.1.2.5.  \n \n \nPC DCs 1, 4, and 5 apply. Applicant lied in an internal affairs investigation, he \ndisobeyed a sergeant\u2019s order not to go home without completing a report, he abused \nsick leave, he failed to turn in a license plate to the property room the day it was \nseized, he used a privately owned blue-light without required permission, and there is \n\u201csubstantial evidence\u201d he assaulted a suspect by slapping him with the back of his \nhand. His former employer provided this reliable, unfavorable information. Applicant \nadmitted all of the conduct, except for slapping the suspect. This conduct reflects \nadversely on Applicant and if known, would affect his reputation in the community. The \nmisconduct is a series of rules violations.   \n \nA security concern based on Guideline E may be mitigated by any of the \nfollowing mitigating conditions: \n \nE2.A5.1.3.1.  The information was unsubstantiated or not \npertinent to a determination of judgment, trustworthiness, or reliability; \nE2.A5.1.3.2.  The falsification was an isolated incident, was not \nrecent, and the individual has subsequently provided correct information \nvoluntarily; \nE2.A5.1.3.3.  The individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to \ncorrect the falsification before being confronted with the facts; \nE2.A5.1.3.4.  Omission of material facts was caused or \nsignificantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel, and the previously omitted information was \npromptly and fully provided; \nE2.A5.1.3.5.  The individual has taken positive steps to \nsignificantly reduce or eliminate vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, \nor duress; \nE2.A5.1.3.6.  A refusal to cooperate was based on advice from \nlegal counsel or other officials that the individual was not required to \n\n \n \n14\ncomply with security processing requirements and, upon being made \naware of the requirement, fully and truthfully provided the requested \ninformation; and, \nE2.A5.1.3.7.  Association with persons involved in criminal \nactivities has ceased. \n \nApplicant admitted the conduct alleged in the SOR, except for the allegation that \nhe deliberately struck a suspect with his hand. The rule violations are pertinent to a \ndetermination of judgment and reliability.17 Therefore, the mitigating condition in \nDirective \u00b6 E2.A5.1.3.1 (PC MC 1) does not fully apply.18 Applicant admitted that he \nstruck a suspect with his hand in February 2003. However, the touching was not \ndeliberate or intentional. The allegation of the assault and battery on the suspect is \nunsubstantiated, and is therefore mitigated under PC MC 1. \n \nApplicant did not falsify any security clearance-related documentation, responses \nto interrogatories, or omit any requested information. The mitigating conditions in \nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 E2.A5.1.3.2 to E2.A5.1.3.4 do not apply.   \n \nSecurity concerns can be mitigated under PC MC 5 when an Applicant \u201chas \ntaken positive steps to significantly reduce or eliminate vulnerability to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E2.A5.1.3.5. Applicant disclosed his problems \nconcerning the police department to his family and employers. He admitted his conduct \nin his response to the SOR and on his security clearance application. PC MC 5 applies \nto mitigate \u201c[p]ersonal conduct . . . that increases [Applicant\u2019s] vulnerability to coercion, \nexploitation or duress, such as engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the \nperson's personal, professional, or community standing or render the person \nsusceptible to blackmail.\u201d PC DC 4. He has come to terms with his conduct and \nproblems in the police department, and is open with security officials and others, as \nnecessary about his past mistakes and misjudgments. Applicant is not susceptible to \n                                                          \n17In ISCR Case No. 02-23133 at 4 (App. Bd. June 4, 2004) the Appeal Board explained why \nhistorically remote allegations may remain pertinent and non-mitigated under PC MC 1: \nSecurity clearance adjudications are not limited to consideration of an applicant's \npresent circumstances. To the contrary, an applicant's security eligibility requires \nconsideration of the applicant's present conduct and circumstances in light of the \napplicant's past conduct and circumstances. See Directive, Section 6.3 and Adjudicative \nGuidelines, Item E2.2.1. See also Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528-529 \n(1988). Although the Administrative Judge might conclude Applicant's history of alcohol \nabuse was extenuated or mitigated for purposes of Guideline H (Alcohol Consumption), it \nwas arbitrary and capricious for the Judge to declare Applicant's past alcohol-related \nincidents as not being pertinent to a determination of Applicant's current security \neligibility. Applicant's overall history of alcohol abuse, not just his most recent instances of \nalcohol abuse, was pertinent and relevant to evaluating his security eligibility. Cf. ISCR \nCase No. 98-0582 at 4-5 [App. Bd. Nov. 12, 1999] (\"Furthermore, under the whole person \nconcept, the entire history of Applicant's drug abuse, not merely the most recent period of \nthat drug abuse, must be considered in evaluating Applicant's security eligibility.\"). \nAccordingly, the Judge [in ISCR Case No. 02-23133 at 4 (App. Bd. June 4, 2004)] erred \nby applying Guideline E Mitigating Condition E2.A5.1.3.1. \n18 See ISCR Case No. 04-07360 at 2, 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 26, 2006) (indicating when a mitigating \ncondition cannot be fully applied, \u201csome credit\u201d is still available under that same mitigating condition).   \n\n \n15 \n                                      \n \nblackmail or coercion because of his past problems.  PC MC 5 mitigates PC DC 4; \nhowever, it does not mitigate PC DCs 1 and 5.  \n \nApplicant did not refuse to cooperate with any security-related inquiry. The \nmitigating condition in Directive \u00b6 E2.A5.1.3.6 does not apply. \n \n\u201cAssociation with persons involved in criminal activity,\u201d Directive \u00b6 E2.A5.1.2.6 is \nnot alleged in the SOR, and does not apply. Accordingly, the mitigating condition in \nDirective \u00b6 E2.A5.1.3.7 does not apply.  \n \nIn sum, PC DCs 1 and 5 are partially mitigated by PC MC 1.  However, these two \ndisqualifying conditions are fully mitigated under the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d infra. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \nIn addition to the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I have \nconsidered the general adjudicative guidelines related to the whole person concept \nunder Directive provision E2.2.1 Applicant\u2019s actions were knowledgeable and voluntary \nwhen he: (1) lied in an internal affairs investigation on January 13, 2002, (2) disobeyed \na sergeant\u2019s order not to go home without completing a report on May 29, 2002, (3) \nabused sick leave in mid-2002, (4) failed to turn in a license plate to the property room \nthe day it was seized in 2002, and (5) used a privately-owned blue light without required \npermission in 2002.  \n \nHis pattern of rule violations occurred over a 13 month period, from January 13, \n2002 to February 2003. In 2002, he was 27 years old, sufficiently mature to be fully \nresponsible for his conduct. The motivation for his lying about discussing an \ninvestigation with the dispatcher was to protect, his friend, the dispatcher. The \nmotivation for failing to turn in the license plate, and his initial failure to complete a \nreport was lack of attention to detail. His insubordination when he violated Sergeant B\u2019s \norder to remain at the station until the report was completed was motivated by \nfrustration. His motivation to use a privately-owned blue light was for his safety and that \nof other motorists; however, his failure to seek advance permission was motivated by a \ndesire to cut corners, and possibly because he expected his request to be disapproved.  \n \nApplicant admitted he struck a cocaine-using suspect with the back of his hand, \nbut said it was unintentional. The unauthorized touching resulted when he turned from a \nfamily member to the suspect, while the suspect was being arrested at the suspect\u2019s \napartment. The striking did not result in injury to the suspect. This non-deliberate \ntouching or slap does not violate a rule. Applicant has refuted this allegation, and it \ntherefore, has no security significance.  As indicated previously, the allegation that he \nstruck a suspect is unsubstantiated, and is mitigated under PC MC 1.  \n \nA person who engages in \u201cconduct involving questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, [and] unreliability . . . could indicate that [applicant] may not properly \nsafeguard [sensitive] information.\u201d However, the likelihood of recurrence is insignificant \nbecause he was forthright and candid at his hearing about his misconduct as a police \n\n \n16 \n                                      \n \nofficer.  More than five years has elapsed since Applicant broke any rules. All his \nproblems occurred when he was employed as a patrol officer at the police department. \nAt the police department when a police officer had problems working with one of the \nsergeants, sometimes the other sergeants singled out and put excessive pressure on \nthat police officer. Applicant was immature, and did not respond well to such pressure. \nHe resorted to abuse of sick leave, and likely made other mistakes concerning attention \nto detail, compliance with regulations, insubordination, etc. Once Applicant left the \nunpleasant, stressful environment at the police department, his performance improved \nand the rules\u2019 violations ended, as documented in his post-police employment \nperformance reports.     \n \nThe absence of evidence of any prior or subsequent violation of his employer\u2019s \nrules or requirements (outside the period January 2002 to February 2003), and his \nevident sincerity about making future progress all weigh in his favor. He has provided \nsufficient evidence of his efforts to change, and demonstrate his maturity, attention to \ndetail, compliance with rules, responsibility and rehabilitation. He is unlike to have future \ndisciplinary problems.  His marriage, birth of his child, acceptance of responsibility for a \nstep child, success in new employment, and bachelors degree have all occurred since \nhis last disciplinary problem, which occurred early in 2003.   \n \n \n \nThe likelihood of recurrence is also reduced because of improvement in \nApplicant\u2019s understanding of his situation. Although he did not receive counseling or \ntherapy, he does have a clear perception of, or understanding about, how to avoid \nproblematic situations. Applicant admitted he made stupid mistakes and described what \nhe had done. He provided evidence of remorse, or regret for his mistakes. He promised \nthat in the future he would not lie about his conduct. Instead, he would admit his errors \nimmediately and seek guidance from his supervisors. His record of good post-February \n2003 employment weighs in his favor. His wife, child and step child are positive \ninfluences on his life. His past rules violations do not create current doubt about his \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness, and his past problems do not call into question \nhis current ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.  \n  \n \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, all the facts and \ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude he has mitigated the \nsecurity concerns. The evidence leaves me without doubts as to Applicant\u2019s security \neligibility and suitability.   \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d19 and \nsupporting evidence, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under Enclosure 2 of \nthe Directive. Applicant has mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the \nreasons stated, I conclude he is eligible for access to classified information. \n \n \n \n                                                          \n19See ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd.

Borgstrom, Esq. , Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\n\n2\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant, a 38-year-old employee of a defense contractor, mitigated allegations of criminal\nconduct arising from a series of offenses while in the Army in the 1980's and thereafter in the mid-\n1990's leading to a conviction on a drug charge resulting in incarceration for seven months in 1997.\nSince then he has substantially improved his conduct with no criminal record other than one minor\ntraffic offense. He has demonstrated his rehabilitation for ten years. He mitigated a personal conduct\nallegation concerning failure to list a 1993 security clearance revocation at Question 32 on his\nsecurity clearance application (SF 86) of July 8, 2004, by establishing that he was unaware of the\nrevocation since he had left the Army three months before the revocation and was not notified of it.\nClearance is granted. \nSTATEMENT OF CASE\nOn December 11, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, as amended and\nmodified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the\npreliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. DOHA recommended the case be\nreferred to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued,\ndenied, or revoked.\nOn January 19, 2006, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and requested a hearing.\nThe matter was assigned to me on March 26, 2007. A notice of hearing was issued on April 11,\n2007, for a hearing on April 24, 2007, and held that day. The government offered 17 exhibits and\nall were admitted into evidence. Applicant offered none at the hearing, but the record was left open\nfor 30 days. Applicant submitted one additional exhibit with six attachments that was admitted in\nevidence without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf. The transcript was received on\nMay 2, 2007. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted the specific facts of the two SOR allegations but provided explanatory\ninformation. After a complete review of the record, I make the following findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 38-year-old employee of a defense contractor who works as network analyst\nfor hourly wages. Between 1986 and December 1992 he was on active duty in the Army when he\nheld a security clearance. During his military service he was charged with a number of offenses\nrelating to drugs and alcohol in 1988, 1989, and 1991 (SOR \u00b6 2.a., b.,c., and d.) As a result of this\nconduct the Army Central Personnel Security Clearance Facility (facility) sent him for a\npsychological evaluation for the purpose of determining eligibility for holding a security clearance.\nThis was done by a letter dated May 17, 1992, to the commander of his organization. The evaluation\nwas made on July 21, 1992, and signed by a licensed psychologist in the psychiatry department. It\nrecommended alcohol rehabilitation treatment on an outpatient basis and noted that Applicant was\n\n3\nunaware of the reason for the evaluation. (Exh. 14). \nA Letter of Intent (LOI) to revoke his security clearance was sent by the facility on October\n19, 1992, through his commander (Exh. 15). During the period from the time of his evaluation in\nJuly 1992 until he was honorably discharged as an E-4 in December 1992, he was attempting to get\nan early discharge to attend a trade school and was not at any fixed assignment on the base. The\nfacility did not receive a response to the LOI, so a final revocation letter was sent to the commander\non March 2, 1993, after Applicant had left the service (Exh. 16) and moved to his home three months\nearlier. He was not advised of this action because he had left his mother\u2019s address for forwarding.\nWhen he arrived home, he discovered that she had moved to a new address but he did not file a new\naddress with the Army. \nIn his application for a security clearance (SF 86) filed July 8, 2004, Applicant did not report\nat Question 32 that his security clearance has been revoked by the Army on March 2, 1993, since he\ndid not receive the LOI or the revocation documents. \nAfter leaving the Army, Applicant had a series of drug offenses in 1994, 1995, and 1996\n(SOR \u00b6 2.e., f., and g.). The last two involved a probation violation and several drug charges. These\nwere consolidated, and he pled guilty to one of the charges. He was sentenced to four years\nimprisonment, but served only seven months between September 1996 and April 1997 (Exh. 2). The\nincarceration was a wake-up call for Applicant. After his release he changed his life, enrolled in\nAlcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous, and has not used alcohol or drugs for ten years.\nHis only legal infraction in the past ten years has been one speeding ticket in 2000. \nApplicant is well regarded by his employer (Exh.A 1-4) for his technical and management\nskills, and his work ethic. He was married in 1997 and has three children ages 18, 13 and 7 for whom\nhe is responsible. He has owned his own home since May 2000. He has an associate degree in\ninformation technology management. \nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position that will give that person access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527.\nAn evaluation of whether the applicant meets the security guidelines includes consideration\nof the following factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and\nmaturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence\nof rehabilitation and other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential\nfor pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nDirective, \u00b6 E2.2.1. Security clearances are granted only when \u201cit is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to do so.\u201d Executive Order No. 10865 \u00a7 2. See Executive Order No. 12968 \u00a7 3.1(b).\nInitially, the government must establish, by something less than a preponderance of the\n\n4\nevidence, that conditions exist in the personal or professional history of the applicant which\ndisqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information\nSee Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. The applicant then bears the burden of demonstrating it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance. \u201cAny doubt as to\nwhether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved\nin favor of the national security.\u201d Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.2. \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should\nerr, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. See Executive Order No. 12968 \u00a7\n3.1(b).\nCONCLUSIONS\nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate\nadjudicative factors, I conclude the following with respect to all allegations set forth in the SOR:\nApplicant\u2019s failure to report the revocation of his security clearance in 1993 prompted the\nallegations of security concerns under the revised Adjudicative Guideline E (Personal Conduct).\nSuch conduct might indicate questionable judgment, unreliability, and unwillingness to comply with\nrules and regulations and could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified\ninformation (AG \u00b6 15). Specifically, the deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant\nand material facts in a personnel security interview could raise a security concern and be\ndisqualifying. (AG \u00b6 16 a). The circumstances of the revocation action after he had left the service,\nthe statement of the psychologist (Exh. 14) that Applicant was unaware of the reason for his\nevaluation, and his credible testimony that he did not receive notice of the LOI or the revocation, and\nwas unaware of the action taken until receipt of the SOR warrants a determination in his favor on\nthis allegation. \nUnder Guideline J, Criminal Conduct, a security concern arises when there is a history of\ncriminal activity that creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness (AG\n\u00b6 30). Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include allegations\nor admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, prosecuted\nor convicted (AG \u00b6 31 c), or a single serious offense or multiple lesser offenses (AG \u00b6 31 a). The\ncriminal conduct of Applicant during his Army service and the period up to and including his\nincarceration ending in 1997 was sufficient to warrant the allegation under this guideline. The\nallegations could be mitigated if so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior occurred that\nit unlikely to recur. (AG \u00b6 32 a), or there is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation (AG \u00b6 32 d).\nThe fact that all the offenses are now ten years old or older and there has been evidence of successful\nrehabilitation over the past ten years warrants application of both mitigating conditions. \nIn all adjudications the protection of our national security is of paramount concern. Persons\nwho have access to classified information have an overriding responsibility for the security concerns\nof the nation. The objective of the security clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense\nassessment of a person\u2019s trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information. \nThe \u201cwhole person\u201d concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of their acts\n\n5\nand omissions. Each case must be judged on its own merits taking into consideration all relevant\ncircumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis. Applicant led\na troubled life with several arrests and charges both during his military service and the period\nthereafter which led finally to his incarceration. He has changed his conduct over the past ten years\nand now holds a responsible position with family obligations which he fulfilling. \nAfter considering all the evidence in its totality, including the whole person of Applicant, I\nconclude a security clearance should be granted.\nFORMAL FINDINGS \nFormal findings as required by the Directive (Par. E3.1.25) are as follows:\nParagraph 1. Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2.

Applicant requested that the case be\ndecided upon the written record.  On March 26, 2007, after considering the record,  Administrative\nJudge Elizabeth M. Matchinski denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant timely\nappealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether Applicant was denied due process;\nwhether the Judge erred in concluding that Applicant had deliberately falsified his security clearance\napplication; whether the Judge erred by concluding that the security concerns raised under\nGuidelines F, J and E had not been mitigated.1\n(1) On appeal, Applicant argues that the Judge\u2019s adverse decision should be reversed because\nthe credit report submitted by the government was dated and the favorable information in the\nevidentiary file was not considered by the Judge.  The  Board construes Applicant\u2019s argument as\nraising the issue of whether he received due process. \nAfter reviewing the record in this case, the Board concludes that Applicant was reasonably\nprovided with the procedural rights set forth in Executive Order 10865 and the Directive, and that\nthe Judge evaluated his case in a professional manner, consistent with her role as an impartial\npresiding official.  Applicant elected to have his case decided upon the written record.  Upon receipt\nof the government\u2019s File of Relevant Material (FORM), Applicant had the burden of \u201c. . .\nsubmit[ting] a documentary response setting forth objections, rebuttal, extenuation, mitigation, or\nexplanation, as appropriate.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.7.  He in fact submitted a response that included\nmultiple documentary exhibits.  \nA close reading of the Judge\u2019s decision indicates that the Judge read, considered and cited\nto the evidence Applicant relies on for his Appeal.  The Judge specifically cited to the January 2007\ncredit report.\n(2) Applicant contends that he did not deliberately falsify his 2004 security clearance\napplication by failing to disclose nine debts that were delinquent for over 90 or 180 days and a prior\ncriminal charge.  In support of this contention, he argues that the government was aware of the\ninformation in question from record checks, previous background investigations, or because it had\nbeen provided at some point during the current investigation.  Applicant\u2019s argument does not\ndemonstrate that the Judge erred.\nThe Judge had the opportunity to consider Applicant\u2019s explanation for why he failed to\ndisclose the information in question.  The Judge was not bound, as a matter of law, to accept or reject\nApplicant\u2019s explanation.  The Judge considered Applicant\u2019s explanation in light of the record\nevidence as a whole, and concluded there was a sufficient basis to find that Applicant\u2019s omissions\nwere deliberate and intentional.  Given the record in this case, the Judge\u2019s findings of deliberate\n\nAlong with his brief, Applicant attaches some items of documentary evidence.  The Board may not consider\n2\nnew evidence on appeal.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.\n3\nfalsification are sustainable.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1; ISCR Case No. 04-03849 at 2-3 (App. Bd.\nJan. 26, 2006).\n(3) Applicant argues that the Judge erred in concluding that the security concerns raised\nunder Guidelines F, J and E had not been mitigated, in that she gave insufficient weight to the\nfavorable evidence in the record, including the facts that his debts had resulted from a previous \ndivorce and he had retained a credit counselor, and his excellent job performance and military\nservice.    Applicant\u2019s argument does not demonstrate that the Judge erred.\n2\nThe federal government need not wait until an applicant actually mishandles or fails to\nproperly handle classified information before it can deny or revoke access to such information.  See\nAdams v. Laird, 420 F. 2d 230, 238-239 (D.C. Cir. 1969), cert. denied, 397 U.S. 1039 (1970).  An\napplicant with good or exemplary job performance may engage in conduct that has negative security\nimplications.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 99-0123 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 11, 2000).  The Directive's\nGuidelines set forth a variety of examples of off-duty conduct and circumstances which are of\nsecurity concern to the government and mandate a whole-person analysis to determine an applicant's\nclearance eligibility.  A whole-person analysis is not confined to the workplace. See ISCR Case No.\n03-11231 at 3 (App. Bd. Jun. 4, 2004).\n\u201c[T]here is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance.\u201d Dorfmont v. Brown,\n913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  Once the government\nth\npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to establish mitigation.\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15.  The application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and whole person\nfactors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the particular facts of a\ncase.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-14740 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan.15, 2003).  Thus, the presence of some\nmitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.\nAs the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable\nevidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the\nJudge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence,\nis not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner\nthat is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-01181 at 3-4 (App. Bd.\nJan. 30, 2004). \nIn this case, the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the\nlength and seriousness of the disqualifying conduct, and considered the possible application of\nrelevant mitigating conditions and whole-person factors.  She found in favor of the Applicant with\nrespect to a number of the factual allegations.  However, she reasonably explained why the evidence\nwhich the Applicant had presented in mitigation was insufficient to overcome all of the\ngovernment\u2019s security concerns.  The Board does not review a case de novo.  The favorable record\nevidence cited by Applicant is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary,\n\n4\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-28041 at 4 (App. Bd.

Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nOn appeal, Applicant raises the following issue: whether  the Administrative Judge\u2019s decision\nis arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Specifically, Applicant argues that the Judge should have\naccepted Applicant\u2019s testimony of her innocence as to drug charges in 2004, despite her guilty plea\nto those charges at the time, and her testimony that she did not intentionally falsify her security\nclearance application because of the state court expungement of her drug offenses.  She contends that\nthe Judge should have mitigated  her drug arrests in 1995 and 1993 due to the passage of time and\nthe fact that the charges in 1995 were dismissed.  Applicant also argues for mitigation due to\nsuccessful completion of a drug rehabilitation program.  The Board affirms the Judge\u2019s decision.\nApplicant\u2019s testimony at the hearing about the events at issue was relevant evidence, but it\nwas not binding on the Administrative Judge.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to consider an\napplicant\u2019s testimony in light of the record evidence as a whole.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-22404\nat 4 (App. Bd. May 5, 2005).  Here, the Judge\u2019s material findings were reasonably supported by the\nrecord evidence, and the Judge\u2019s conclusions follow rationally from the Judge\u2019s findings. \nThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions does not turn simply on a finding\nthat one or more of them applies to the particular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires\nthe exercise of sound discretion in light of the record evidence as a whole.  Thus, the presence of\nsome mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance\ndecision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the\nfavorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  An applicant\u2019s disagreement\nwith the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the\nevidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in\na manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-02471 at 2\n(App. Bd. Apr. 11, 2007).\nIn this case, the Judge reasonably weighed the mitigating evidence against the seriousness\nof the disqualifying conduct, and considered the possible application of relevant mitigating\nconditions.  He reasonably explained why there was insufficient mitigating evidence to overcome\nthe government\u2019s security concerns.  The Board does not review a case de novo.  The favorable\nevidence cited by the Applicant is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case 05-02619 at 2 (App. Bd.

On January 31, 2007, after considering the record, Administrative Judge Shari\nDam denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in concluding\nApplicant\u2019s falsification of her security clearance application was deliberate; whether the Judge\u2019s\nunfavorable clearance decision under Guideline F is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.1\n(1) Applicant argues that she did not deliberately falsify her security clearance application\nby failing to disclose four prior criminal charges relating to worthless checks.  In support of that\nargument, Applicant contends that she failed to list the charges due to an oversight, and she\nsubsequently provided the correct information to the government once she realized the gravity of the\nsituation.  Applicant\u2019s argument does not demonstrate that the Judge erred.\nThe Judge had the opportunity to consider Applicant\u2019s explanation for why she failed to\ndisclose the information in question.  The Judge was not bound, as a matter of law, to accept or reject\nApplicant\u2019s explanation.  The Judge considered Applicant\u2019s explanation in light of the record\nevidence as a whole, and concluded there was a sufficient basis to find that Applicant\u2019s omission was\ndeliberate and intentional.  On this record, the Judge\u2019s finding of deliberate falsification is\nsustainable.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.   \n(2) Applicant also argues that the Judge should have concluded that the security concerns\nraised by her history of financial difficulties had been mitigated because her indebtedness arose from\ncircumstances beyond her control, and she has now received counseling and started to make\npayments on her outstanding debts.  As attachments to her brief, Applicant submits new evidence,\nincluding four character reference letters, and a letter and statement of account from her credit\ncounseling service which indicates that she is continuing to make payments on her outstanding debts\nin accordance with her established plan.  Applicant\u2019s arguments do not demonstrate that the Judge\nerred. \nThe Board may not consider new evidence on appeal.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.  Accordingly,\nwe may not consider the attachments to Applicant\u2019s brief, and they do not demonstrate error on the\npart of the Judge.\n\u201c[T]here is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance.\u201d Dorfmont v. Brown,\n913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  Once the government\nth\npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to establish mitigation.\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15.   The application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions does not turn simply\non a finding that one or more of them apply to the particular facts of a case.  Rather, their application\nrequires the exercise of sound discretion in light of the record evidence as a whole.  See, e.g., ISCR\nCase No. 01-14740 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan.15, 2003).  Thus, the presence of some mitigating evidence\ndoes not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact,\n\n3\nthe Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs\nthe unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of\nthe evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to\ndemonstrate that the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.\nThe Applicant has not met her burden of demonstrating that the Judge erred in concluding\nthat the Guideline F allegations had not been mitigated.  Although Applicant strongly disagrees with\nthe Judge\u2019s conclusions, she has not established that those conclusions are arbitrary, capricious, or\ncontrary to law.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.3.  We note that Applicant did not avail herself of the\nopportunity to submit evidence in response to the File of Relevant Material.\nIn this case, the Judge found that Applicant had a history of not meeting financial obligations\nwhich extended over many years.  At the time the case was submitted for decision, she still had\noutstanding debts and was still in the process of making arrangements to repay them.  In light of the\nforegoing, the Judge could reasonably conclude that Applicant\u2019s financial problems were recent and\nstill ongoing.  The favorable record evidence cited by Applicant is not sufficient to demonstrate the\nJudge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-28041 at\n4 (App. Bd. June 29, 2005).  The Judge specifically noted Applicant\u2019s arrangement with a credit\ncounseling service and the payment of a debt.

This action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified, and Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Jan. 2, 1992),\nas amended and modified (Directive).  The SOR alleged security concerns raised under Guidelines\nF (Financial Considerations), J (Criminal Conduct), and E (Personal Conduct) of the Directive. \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing in an undated document, admitted some allegations\nand denied some, and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was\nassigned to me on November 9, 2006, and heard on December 12, 2006, as scheduled.  DOHA\nreceived the hearing transcript (Tr.) on December 29, 2006.\nPROCEDURAL RULING\nAt the hearing, I granted Department Counsel's motion to amend the SOR pursuant to the\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.17, by adding the following subparagraph under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct):\n2.d.  You were arrested and charged with Driving While Intoxicated in about\nFebruary 2004 in (redacted city and state).  You pleaded guilty and your license was\nrestricted for six months.\nThe amendment was based on Applicant\u2019s hearing testimony. He did not object to the amendment.\nI kept the record open to permit Applicant to submit additional evidence concerning SOR \u00b6 2.d (Tr.\n98).  I received his additional evidence on December 29, 2006, and it has been admitted as\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit (AX) M.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant's admissions in his answer to the SOR and at the hearing are incorporated into my\nfindings of fact.  I make the following findings:\nApplicant is a 39-year-old employee of a defense contractor who trains U.S. Army soldiers\nin communications (Tr. 39).  He has worked for his current employer since January 2000.  He served\nas tank mechanic in the U.S. Army from June 1988 to February 1993.  He had two years of college\nand received an associate\u2019s degree (Tr. 6).  He has never held a security clearance (Tr. 7).\nIn June 1992, while Applicant was on active duty, his commander discovered an unregistered\npistol in the glove compartment of his car during an unannounced inspection.  Applicant had just\npurchased the pistol.  His commander notified the military police, who seized the pistol and took\nApplicant to the military police station, where he was \u201cprocessed\u201d and then released to his unit (GX\n8).  He was never charged with an offense, and no disciplinary action was taken, apparently because\n\n4\nthe applicable local regulation allowed him 72 hours after acquiring the weapon to register it (AX\nL at 5; Tr. 74).\nIn October 1996, Applicant was arrested and charged with driving under the influence (DUI)\nand refusing a breathalyzer test.  He testified he took the breathalyzer, but the police were unable to\nobtain a reading (Tr. 44).  The DUI charge was reduced to reckless driving and the breathalyzer\nrefusal was dismissed.  He pleaded guilty to the reduced charge and was sentenced to 25 hours of\ncommunity service, which he served by giving piano lessons in a community center (GX 6 at 3; GX\n7; Tr. 50).  The judge told him his conviction of reckless driving would be removed from his record\nwithin a year (Tr. 47).\nIn February 2004, Applicant was arrested and charged with DWI.  He pleaded guilty, and his\nlicense was suspended for six months.  This offense was not initially alleged in the SOR.  At the\nhearing, the SOR was amended to add this allegation (Tr. 98), after Applicant disclosed the arrest\nin response to an open-ended question from department counsel, asking, \u201cSince 1996, have you had\nany other alcohol-related arrests?\u201d (Tr. 51.)\nApplicant stopped consuming alcohol regularly after the DWI arrest in 2004.  He testified\nhis wife does not allow drinking and driving (Tr. 91).  He now limits his consumption to an\noccasional glass of wine on special occasions (AX M at 2; Tr. 92).\nApplicant was married in September 1992 and divorced in January 1994.  He remarried in\nNovember 2001.  He and his first wife were on active duty at the same time, but she was in the Navy\n(Tr. 55).  They had a child shortly before their divorce, and Applicant was ordered to pay child\nsupport.  His ex-wife left the state, they had no contact for six years, and Applicant did not know\nwhere she was living.  His ex-wife eventually contacted him, seeking child support payments for the\nprevious six years.  His credit report dated December 29, 2005, reflected an arrearage of $11,714\n(GX 5 at 2).  Applicant\u2019s lawyer advised him to set up an automatic deduction from his pay,\nsufficient to pay the monthly amount ordered plus an additional amount to pay the arrearage.\nApplicant followed this advice.  In addition, his tax refunds are being used to pay the arrearage (AX\nG, H, I, J, and K).  The arrearage on this account has been reduced to about $1,598 (AX A at 1).\nApplicant also pays child support for a second child born in September 1989 by another\nwoman.  His credit report reflected an arrearage of $1,553 on this account (GX 5 at 2).  In a\nstatement to a security investigator in September 2004, he asserted he had overpaid the child support\nfor this child (GX  2 at 3-4).  Government records reflect an overpayment of $3,942.90 (AX B at 2).\nApplicant\u2019s credit reports also reflected a delinquent electric bill for $277, turned over for\ncollection in January 2000; a delinquent credit card account for $3,707, turned over for collection\nin October 2001; a delinquent gas bill for $999, turned over for collection in July 2002; and a\ndelinquent telephone bill for $975, turned over for collection in November 2002 (GX 3 at 2-4; GX\n5 at 1-2).  He believes that his ex-wife incurred the credit card debt and telephone bill.  He was\nunaware of the delinquent electric bill and gas bill, left unpaid after he moved in 1999, until his\nbackground investigation revealed them (Tr. 73).  In August 2006, he paid all four debts in full (AX\nA at 4; AX D; AX E; AX F).\n\n5\nApplicant executed a security clearance application (SF 86) on October 7, 2003.  He\nanswered \u201cno\u201d to question 24, asking if he had ever been charged with or convicted of any offenses\nrelated to alcohol or drugs (GX 1 at 6).  He did not disclose his arrest for DUI in October 1996.  He\ntestified that he thought the question had nothing to do with his arrest and conviction because he\nultimately was charged only with reckless driving, and the judge told him it would be removed from\nhis record within a year (Tr. 75-76).\nApplicant answered \u201cno\u201d to question 38 of his SF 86, asking if he had been more than 180\ndays delinquent on any debt during the last seven years and question 39, asking if he was currently\nmore than 90 days delinquent on any debt (GX 1 at 7).  He disclosed his child support arrearage in\nthe response to question 43 on the application (GX 1 at 8).  He did not disclose the delinquent\nelectric bill, credit card account, telephone bill, and gas bill, because he was unaware of them until\nhis background investigation was initiated (Tr. 73).\nApplicant earns about $59,000 per year in his primary job, and he earns about $2,000 per\nmonth as a musician.  His wife is a computer programer and earns about $60,000 per year.  His home\nmortgage payment is about $800 per month (Tr. 67)  He and his wife have about $2,000 in their\nchecking account and between $4,000 and $5,000 in savings.  They have three credit card accounts,\nwhich are current (Tr. 68-69).  He leases his car for $641 per month, and his wife\u2019s car payments are\n$427 per month (AX A at 3).  \nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d  Id. at\n527.  The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants\neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within\nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.  Eligibility for a security clearance is\npredicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  An\napplicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec.\n19, 2002).\nThe Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines for determining eligibility for access to\nclassified information, and it lists the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC)\nfor each guideline.  Each clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision\nbased on the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors\nlisted in the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 6.3.1 through 6.3.6.\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the\ngovernment.  The government must be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in persons\nwith access to classified information.  However, the decision to deny an individual a security\nclearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  See Exec. Or. 10865\n\n6\n\u00a7 7.  It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the\nSecretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.\nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal\nor professional history of the applicant which disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being\neligible for access to classified information.  See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \"Substantial evidence\" is\n\"more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\"  See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth.,\n36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).  \u201c[T]he Directive presumes there is a nexus or rational connection\nbetween proven conduct under any of the Criteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security\nsuitability.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996.)\nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the\nburden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3; see Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it\nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d  ISCR Case\nNo. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).  \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they\nmust, on the side of denials.\u201d  Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see Directive \u00b6 E2.2.2. \nCONCLUSIONS\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations)\nUnder this guideline, \u201c[a]n individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to\nengage in illegal acts to generate funds.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E2.A6.1.1.  A person who fails or refuses to\npay long-standing debts or is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible or careless in his or\nher duty to protect classified information.  Two disqualifying conditions (DC) under this guideline\ncould raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case.  DC 1 applies where an\napplicant has a history of not meeting his or her financial obligations.  Directive \u00b6 E2.A6.1.2.1.  DC\n3 applies where an applicant has exhibited inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.  Directive \u00b6\nE2.A6.1.2.3.  DC 1 is raised by Applicant\u2019s history of delinquent debts.  DC 3 is not raised, because\nApplicant is not financially overextended, has a good income, and has demonstrated that he is able\nand willing to pay his financial obligations.\nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise DC 1, the burden shifted to\nApplicant to produce evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.15.  Applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving\nit is never shifted to the government.  See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).\nA security concern based on financial problems can be mitigated by showing the delinquent\ndebts were not recent (MC 1) or were isolated incidents (MC 2).  Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E2.A6.1.3.1.,\nE2.A6.1.3.2.  Applicant had multiple delinquent debts that were only recently resolved.  I conclude\nMC 1 and MC 2 are not established.\nSecurity concerns arising from financial problems can be mitigated by showing they are the\nresult of conditions \u201clargely beyond the person\u2019s control\u201d (MC 3).  Directive \u00b6 E2.A6.1.3.3.  Even\nif Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose due to circumstances beyond control, it is\n\n7\nappropriate to consider whether he acted in a reasonable manner when dealing with his financial\ndifficulties.  ISCR Case No. 02-02116 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 25, 2003).  Applicant\u2019s ex-wife and\nsecond child disappeared after their divorce.  His ex-wife reappeared six years later and sought\npayment of the child support.  Applicant responded by initiating a payment plan to pay the child\nsupport and arrearage, and he has complied with that plan.  As soon as he discovered that his credit\nreport reflected old debts, some incurred by his ex-wife, he resolved them.  I conclude that\nApplicant\u2019s divorce and the disappearance of his ex-wife and child were circumstances beyond his\ncontrol, but he responded reasonably to the financial problems attributable to the breakup of his\nfamily.  Accordingly, I conclude MC 3 is established.\nA security concern arising from financial problems can be mitigated by showing a good-faith\neffort to resolve debts (MC 6).  Directive \u00b6 E2.A6.1.3.6.  The concept of good faith \u201crequires a\nshowing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence\nto duty or obligation.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 99-0201, 1999 WL 1442346 at *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999).\nEvidence of past irresponsibility is not mitigated by payment of debts only under pressure of\nqualifying for a security clearance.  \nApplicant took reasonable steps to discharge his child support obligations for his younger\nchild, and he overpaid the child support for his older child.  He paid off the old credit card debt and\nutility bills as soon as he discovered them.  I conclude MC 6 is established.\nGuideline J (Criminal Conduct)\nA history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about an applicant\u2019s judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness.  Directive \u00b6 E2.A10.1.1.  Disqualifying conditions may be based on\nallegations or an applicant\u2019s admission of criminal conduct, whether or not charged (DC 1).\nDirective \u00b6 E2.A10.1.2.1. A single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses may also be\ndisqualifying (DC 2).  Directive \u00b6 E2.A10.1.2.2.  \nThe 1992 weapons incident did not result in an arrest or charges.  The military police report\nreflects only that he was \u201cprocessed.\u201d  He was not arrested or charged.  His possession of a recently-\npurchased pistol did not violate the pertinent local regulation.  In short, no crime occurred.  I\nconclude he has refuted the allegation in SOR \u00b6 2.b, and I resolve it in his favor.\nFor the reasons set out below under Guideline E, I conclude Applicant did not intentionally\nfalsify his SF 86.  Thus, I resolve SOR \u00b6 2.c in his favor.\nApplicant\u2019s DUI arrest in 1996 and DWI conviction in 2004 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.d) are\nsufficient to raise DC 1 and shift the burden to Applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the\nfacts.  Criminal conduct can be mitigated by showing it was not recent (MC 1), it was an isolated\nincident (MC 2), or there is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation (MC 6).  Directive \u00b6\u00b6\nE2.A10.1.3.1., E2.A10.1.3.2., E2.A10.1.3.6.  \nApplicant\u2019s two arrests were eight years apart.  The evidence of intoxication was insufficient\nto warrant prosecution for DUI in 1996.  Applicant admitted his guilt of DWI in 2004, but there is\nno evidence of a pattern of alcohol-related misconduct.  Applicant\u2019s DWI conviction occurred after\nhe submitted his SF 86, and the incident appears to have been atypical behavior and an isolated\n\n8\nincident of bad judgment.  Under all the circumstances, I conclude the two arrests were \u201cisolated\u201d\nwithin the meaning of MC 2. \nThe issues under both MC 1 and MC 6 are whether there has been a significant period of time\nwithout any evidence of misconduct, and whether the evidence shows changed circumstances or\nconduct.  The Directive is silent on what constitutes a sufficient period of reform and rehabilitation.\nThe sufficiency of an applicant\u2019s period of conduct without recurrence of past misconduct does not\nturn on any bright-line rules concerning the length of time needed to demonstrate reform and\nrehabilitation, but rather on a reasoned analysis of the facts and circumstances of an applicant\u2019s case\nbased on a careful evaluation of the record.  If the evidence shows that a significant period of time\nhas passed without evidence of misconduct by an applicant, then an administrative judge must\narticulate a rational basis for concluding why that significant period of time does not demonstrate\nchanged circumstances or conduct sufficient to warrant a finding of reform or rehabilitation.  ISCR\nCase No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004).\nApplicant\u2019s DWI arrest was in February 2004, almost three years ago. Applicant stopped\ndrinking and driving after that incident, and he now limits his consumption to an occasional glass\nof wine on special occasions.  His wife strongly disapproves of drinking and driving.  There is no\nevidence of any alcohol-related misconduct since February 2004.  Applicant impressed me as\nsincerely remorseful about the incident.  I conclude MC 1 and MC 6 are established.\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct)\nConduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate an applicant may\nnot properly safeguard classified information.  Directive \u00b6 E2.A5.1.1.  A disqualifying condition (DC\n2) under this guideline also may be established by \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification\nof relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement,\nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits\nor status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E2.A5.1.2.2. \nWhen a falsification allegation is controverted, as in this case, the government has the burden\nof proving it.  Proof of an omission, standing alone, does not prove an applicant\u2019s state of mind when\nthe omission occurred.  An administrative judge must consider the record evidence as a whole to\ndetermine whether there is direct or circumstantial evidence concerning an applicant\u2019s state of mind\nat the time of the omission.  See ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004) (explaining\nholding in ISCR Case No. 02-23133 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004)).\nApplicant denied intentionally falsifying his SF 86.  He disclosed his child support arrearage\non his SF 86.  At the hearing, he candidly disclosed the February 2004 DWI conviction, even though\ndepartment counsel was unaware of it.  He did not believe that the question about alcohol-related\narrest in 1996 applied to him, because he believed the DUI charge was dismissed for lack of\nevidence, and because the judge told him his conviction would not appear on his record.  I found his\nexplanation plausible and credible, especially in light of his candor about the February 2004 DWI.\nSimilarly, I found his explanation about the undisclosed debts plausible and credible.  I conclude that\n\n9\nApplicant has refuted the allegations of falsification in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a, 3.b, and 3.c, and I resolve those\nallegations in his favor.\nWhole Person Analysis\nIn addition to considering the specific disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each\nguideline, I have also considered: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency\nand recency of the conduct; (4) the applicant\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the\nvoluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E2.2.1.1\nthrough E2.2.1.9.  Several of these factors are addressed under the specific guidelines above, but\nsome merit additional comment.\nApplicant is a mature adult who has served his country for many years, first as a soldier and\nthen as a contractor training soldiers.  I was impressed by his candor and sincerity at the hearing.\nHe has learned from his mistakes.  He has resolved his financial problems and is no longer\nvulnerable to pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress.  I am satisfied that recurrence of his\nfinancial problems or criminal conduct is very unlikely.  After weighing the disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions under Guidelines F, J, and E, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of\nthe whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns based on based on\nfinancial considerations and criminal conduct, and he has refuted the allegations regarding personal\nconduct.  Accordingly, I conclude he has carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant him a security clearance.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1. Guideline F (Financial):\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\n\n10\nParagraph 2.

    "summary": "FINDINGS OF FACT Applicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR, and I have incorporated them into the findings of fact. In addition, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 33-year-old married man with two children. The older child is 10 years old and the younger child is an infant. He is a painter and carpenter who works on long-term projects at U.S. embassies worldwide. He has a high school education, and he has held a security clearance intermittently since the mid-1990s. Applicant began using marijuana in 1990, at age 16, smoking it approximately once every three months. By 1992, he was smoking it once per month. His use grew increasingly sporadic 2 between approximately 1993 and 2000, decreasing to a few times per year.

He has used marijuana less than 20 times between 2003 and 2006, 3 the year he stopped. Over the years, Applicant has participated as a \u201c\u2018middleman\u2019\u201d for selling marijuana.\u201d His 4 friends would ask him where to get some marijuana, and he would identify a supplier. He never sold it for profit. In January 2007, when a security clearance investigator asked Applicant whether he would resume marijuana use in the future, he responded as follows: I acknowledge that I will probably smoke marijuana in the future. I am not addicted to it. I don\u2019t have to use it but the reality is that if it is offered to me in the ",

Edmunds, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant\u2019s 16-year history of drug abuse, and his failure to fully disclose it, as required, on\nseveral security clearance applications between 1999 and 2004 generate drug involvement, personal\nconduct, and criminal conduct security concerns that he failed to mitigate. Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\n\nExecutive Order 10865, Section 5(a).\n1\nItem 8 at 9.\n2\n2\nOn March 1, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant\na Statement of Reasons (SOR) explaining why it was not clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant or continue a security clearance. This action was taken under Executive Order 10865, dated\nFebruary 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive 5220.6, dated January 2, 1992, as amended. He\nanswered the SOR on March 12, 2007, admitting all the allegations and electing to have the case\ndecided on the written record.\nDepartment Counsel mailed the government\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) to Applicant\non April 26, 2007. He received it on September 12, 2007. Applicant was afforded an opportunity to\nfile objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. He neither objected to\nany of the FORM submissions, nor filed any additional evidence to be considered. The case was\nassigned to me on November 30, 2007 requesting an administrative determination.\nRULINGS ON EVIDENCE\n1. Department Counsel\u2019s motion to amend SOR subparagraphs 2.c and 2.d by replacing\n\u201cDepartment of Defense\u201d with \u201cDepartment of State\u201d is granted.\n2. Department Counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw SOR Paragraph 4 is granted.\n3. Department Counsel\u2019s motion to amend the SOR by cross-alleging SOR subparagraphs\n1.a through 1.i under SOR Paragraph 3 is denied.\n4. I have excluded sua sponte, Item 10, a Department of State investigative report, from the\nrecord.1\nFINDINGS OF FACT \nApplicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR, and I have incorporated them into the\nfindings of fact. In addition, I make the following findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 33-year-old married man with two children. The older child is 10 years old and\nthe younger child is an infant. He is a painter and carpenter who works on long-term projects at U.S.\nembassies worldwide. He has a high school education, and he has held a security clearance\nintermittently since the mid-1990s.\nApplicant began using marijuana in 1990, at age 16, smoking it approximately once every\nthree months.  By 1992, he was smoking it once per month. His use grew increasingly sporadic\n2\nbetween approximately 1993 and 2000, decreasing to a few times per year. Between 2000 and 2003,\n\nItem 8 at 10.\n3\nItem 8 at 11.\n4\nItem 8 at 10.\n5\nItem 3 at 7.\n6\nId. at 4.\n7\n3\nhe again began using it monthly.  He has used marijuana less than 20 times between 2003 and 2006,\n3\nthe year he stopped. \nOver the years, Applicant has participated as a \u201c\u2018middleman\u2019\u201d for selling marijuana.\u201d  His\n4\nfriends would ask him where to get some marijuana, and he would identify a supplier. He never sold\nit for profit.\nIn January 2007, when a security clearance investigator asked Applicant whether he would\nresume marijuana use in the future, he responded as follows:\nI acknowledge that I will probably smoke marijuana in the future. I am not addicted\nto it. I don\u2019t have to use it but the reality is that if it is offered to me in the future, I\nwill take a puff of it.  \n5\nIn his March 2007 Answer, Applicant stated, \u201cI have chose [sic] not to smoke, and will\nchoose not to do so in the future regardless of clearance loss.\u201d6\nOver the past 15 years, Applicant has also abused other illegal drugs, including\nhallucinogenic mushrooms and LSD between 1990 and 1991, cocaine on two occasions between\n1991 and 2001, speed on one occasion in 1994, and ecstasy on one occasion in 1997. Once in\napproximately 1994, he abused Tylox, a prescription pain reliever.\nIn 1998, Applicant was involved in the theft of construction materials from an overseas,\nisland military base. The material was located on the construction site of a company that was\nperforming contract work for the military. Applicant\u2019s friends stole the material from the base, and\ntransported it to him. Then, Applicant and his friend unloaded the materials and stored it on\nApplicant\u2019s boat. Later, Applicant and his friend used the materials to complete a construction\nproject located near the base. \nSubsequently, the material was reported stolen, and an investigation ensued. Applicant was\ncharged with embezzlement and theft. Consequently, he was barred from the island for six months.7\nIn a 2007 interview with a security clearance investigator, Applicant admitted lying to the\npolice officer who investigated the 1998 construction materials theft. Also, during the same 2007\ninterview, he admitted to lying to a security clearance investigator in 2000 about the 1998 theft and\nhis history of drug abuse.\n\nItem 10 at 15.\n8\nItem 8 at 15.\n9\nSee generally, Directive, Sec. 2.3, Sec. 2.5.3, Sec. 3.2, and Sec. 4.2.\n10\n4\nWhen Applicant  met with the police investigator in 1998, he had a security clearance, and\nwas afraid any \u201cadmissions would negatively affect\u201d it.  When the security clearance investigator\n8\ninterviewed him in 2000, he was afraid that if he was fully forthcoming about the circumstances\nleading to the 1998 theft charge, he would not get the job for which he had applied.\nIn 1999, Applicant electronically submitted a security clearance application. He answered\n\u201cno\u201d in response to Question 27 (Your Use of Illegal Drugs and Drug Activity Since the age of 16\nor in the last 7 years, whichever is shorter, have you illegally used any controlled substance, for\nexample, marijuana, cocaine, crack cocaine, hashish, narcotics (opium, morphine, codeine, heroin,\netc.), or prescription drugs?\u201d) In response to the same question on three successive security\nclearance applications completed between 1999 and 2004, he also answered \u201cno.\u201d  He falsified the\napplications \u201cout of fear of not getting the clearance and/or job . . .\u201d9\nPOLICIES\nThe adjudicative guidelines, as revised December 29, 2005, and implemented September 1,\n2006, apply to the analysis of this case. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each\nguideline, they are divided into those that may be considered in deciding whether to deny or revoke\nan individual\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information (disqualifying conditions) and those\nthat may be considered in deciding whether to grant an individual\u2019s eligibility for access to classified\ninformation (mitigating conditions).\nBecause the entire process is a scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person\nconcept,\u201d all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and\nunfavorable, should be considered in making a meaningful decision. Specifically these are: (1) the\nnature and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the age of the\napplicant; (5) the extent to which the participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the\npotential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\nSince the protection of national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision\nin each case must be reached by applying the standard that the issuance of the clearance is \u201cclearly\nconsistent with the national interest.\u201d  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions\n10\nthat are based on the evidence contained in the record.\nThe government is responsible for presenting evidence to establish facts in the SOR that have\nbeen controverted. The applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by the government, and has the ultimate burden\nof persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\n\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG) \u00b624.\n11\n5\nCONCLUSIONS\nDrug Involvement\n\u201cUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and because it\nraises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\u201d11\nHere, Applicant\u2019s drug abuse history, part of which coincided with the period that he held a security\nclearance, triggers the application of Drug Involvement Disqualifying Conditions (DI DC) 25(a),\n\u201cany drug abuse,\u201d DI DC 25(c), \u201cillegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing,\nmanufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia,\u201d and DI DC 25(g),\n\u201cany illegal drug use after being granted a security clearance.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s statement to an investigator that he may use marijuana in the future triggers the\napplication of  DI DC 25(h), \u201cexpressed intent to continue illegal drug use, or failure to clearly and\nconvincingly commit to discontinue drug use.\u201d Although he later renounced this statement, its\nsincerity is undercut by his history of dishonesty demonstrated by the numerous false statements to\nlaw enforcement authorities and security clearance investigators over the years.\nI do not conclude, however, that 10 U.S.C. \u00a7986(c)(2) applies. Under this statute, applicants\nwho are unlawful users of, or addicted to controlled substances are disqualified from possessing a\nclearance. Although Applicant failed to demonstrate a clear and convincing commitment to\ndiscontinue drug use, he never expressly indicated he was currently using any drugs. Also, the\ngovernment did not establish he was addicted to drugs. SOR subparagraph 1.k is resolved in\nApplicant\u2019s favor.\nI have considered the mitigating conditions, and conclude none apply. In light of Applicant\u2019s\nextensive drug abuse history, his lack of credibility, and his use while holding a clearance, I conclude\nhe failed to mitigate the drug involvement security concern.\nPersonal Conduct\n\u201cConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to\ncomply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.\u201d Also, \u201c[o]f special interest is any\nfailure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s history of providing false information to police and security clearance\ninvestigators, and falsifying information on security clearance applications triggers the application\nof Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) 16(a), \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment,\nor falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history\nstatement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications,\n\n6\naward benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award\nfiduciary responsibilities,\u201d and PC DC 16(b), \u201cdeliberately providing false or misleading information\nconcerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent medical authority,\nor other official government representative.\u201d\nI have considered all of the mitigating conditions, and conclude none apply. Any positive\ninference generated by his January 2007 disclosure of the earlier falsifications, is greatly outweighed\nby the number of falsifications and the number of years it took for him to disclose them. Significant\npersonal conduct security concerns remain. \nCriminal Conduct\n\u201cCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.\nBy its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules\nand regulations.\u201d Here, Applicant\u2019s 1998 embezzlement and theft charges, and his multiple\nfalsifications trigger the application of Criminal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (CC DC) 31(a),\n\u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses.\u201d Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct was motivated by\nopportunism rather than outside pressure or coercion. Its nature undermines Applicant\u2019s credibility.\nConsequently, any statements of remorse have little probative value. Lastly, he presented no\nevidence of rehabilitation. Applicant has failed to mitigate the criminal conduct security concerns.\nWhole Person Concept\nApplicant has abused drugs for nearly half of his life. During part of this time, he had a\nsecurity clearance. He lied about his drug involvement during several security clearance\ninvestigations, and as recently as January 2007, said he would smoke marijuana in the future. Given\nthe seriousness of the conduct, its recency, and his motivation for the conduct, in conjunction with\nhis lack of credibility, the risk of recurrence remains unacceptably high. Clearance is denied. \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nParagraph 1 - Guideline H:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.j:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2 - Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a -2.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 3 \u2013 Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 4 - Foreign Influence\nWITHDRAWN\n\n7\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

While he did attend treatment in 2005\nand has made some  positive changes in behavior supportive of sobriety, he did not demonstrate his\nongoing and current commitment to abstain from alcohol.  In addition,  has had at least two relapses\nin 2005 and 2006.  Thus, doubt remains over his reform and rehabilitation from his recent criminal\nand alcohol-related conduct. Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR)\nto the Applicant on October 9, 2006.  The SOR detailed reasons why the Government could not\nmake the preliminary positive finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nor continue a security clearance for the Applicant.   The SOR alleged security concerns in paragraph\n1\n1 over Criminal Conduct (Guideline J) and in paragraph 2 over Alcohol Consumption (Guideline\nG) based on the revised (\u201cnew\u201d) Adjudicative Guidelines  issued on December 29, 2005, and\n2\nimplemented by the Department of Defense, effective September 1, 2006.  Applicant responded to\nthese SOR allegations in an Answer notarized and dated November 8, 2006, where he admitted all\nof the allegations  in subparagraphs 1.a., 1.b., 1.c., 1.d., and 1.f., but denied subparagraph 1.e; he\nadmitted all of the allegations in paragraph 2 and  requested a decision without a hearing. \nOn April 30, 2007, Department Counsel, prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM)\nwhich was forwarded to the Applicant on May 1, 2007.  Appliant was advised he had 30 days to\nrespond to the FORM by submitting any objections or any additional information.  In the FORM,\nDepartment Counsel amended SOR \u00b6 1.e. to conform to the evidence:\nSOR \u00b6 1.e.  In January 1998, you were arrested. . . and charged with public\nintoxication.  In March 1998, you were found guilty of public intoxication and were\nsentenced to a $25 fine and $40 court cost.\nApplicant  received the FORM on May 11, 2007, but he sent no objection to the amendment\nnor any response to the FORM, which was due on June 10, 2007.  The matter was assigned to me\non September 10, 2007.  I granted the motion to amend SOR \u00b6 1.e. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due\nconsideration of that evidence, I make the following Findings of Fact:\n  \n\n3\nApplicant, 42 years old, has worked as a senior designer for a defense contractor in State #1\nfrom October 1984 to present.  He completed a Security Clearance Application (SF 86) in February\n2004 as he is seeking a clearance.  (Exhibit 5) He is a graduate of a community college program.\nApplicant is single.  (Exhibit 5)\nCriminal Conduct and Alcohol\nIn February  2004 in response to a question about his police record, Applicant disclosed on\nhis security form that he had five alcohol-related arrests and convictions in 1984, 1987, 1990, 1996,\nand 1998 for either Driving While Intoxicated (DWI) and Drunk in Public where he was fined and/or\nhad his driver\u2019s license suspended.  (Exhibit 5)  Subsequently, he had another arrest in June 2004.\n(Answer; Exhibits 6, 11, 12)   Thus, Applicant has six alcohol-related arrests from 1984 to 2004:\n\u2022  \nApplicant was arrested for Public Drunkenness in April 1984 and fined.  (Answer; Exhibit\n6) (SOR \u00b6 1.a.) \n\u2022\nApplicant was arrested for DWI (First Offense) in December 1987; found guilty, fined, and\ndriver\u2019s license restriction for one year; ordered to attend alcohol safety action program\n(ASAP). (Answer; Exhibit 6)  (SOR \u00b6 1.b.) \n\u2022\nApplicant was arrested for DWI (Second Offense) in March 1990, found guilty, fined,\nordered to attend alcohol safety action program (ASAP) and weekly AA meetings. (Answer;\nExhibit 6)  (SOR \u00b6 1.c.) \n\u2022\nApplicant was arrested initially for DWI (Third Offense)  in December 1996 which was\ndismissed; later he was charged with Reckless Driving and Unreasonable Refusal to Submit\nto a Blood or Breath Test; he pleaded guilty and was sentenced in February 1998 to a $1,500\nfine ($1,250 suspended), two years probation, and driver\u2019s license suspended for one year.\n(Answer; Exhibits 6, 7, 8, 9)  (SOR \u00b6 1.d.) \n\u2022\nApplicant was arrested for Drunk in Public in January 1998; in March 1998 he was found\nguilty in absentia and fined $25 and $40 court costs.  (Answer; Exhibits 4, 6, 10)  (SOR \u00b6\n1.e.) \n\u2022\nApplicant was arrested in June 2004 for Reckless Driving (which was dismissed) and for\nDWI; in November 2004 he was found guilty of DWI, sentenced to six months in jail (5\nmonths and 25 days suspended) where he served two days, two years probation, and was\nfined $750, had a restricted driver\u2019s license for one year, and was ordered to attend an\nalcohol safety action program (ASAP) and weekly AA meetings. (Answer; Exhibits 6, 11,\n12)  (SOR \u00b6 1.f.) \nIn his Response to Interrogatories in August 2006, Applicant reported he had completed a\ntreatment program at a counseling center in July 2005 and achieved 26 weeks of sobriety.  At that\ntime he did not intend to drink in the future and was not then drinking alcohol.  He had sought help\nby attending alcoholics anonymous (AA) meetings; for a period he attended meeting and then quit.\n\n4\nHowever, after he quit attending AA meetings, he had a relapse in December 2005.  He was last\nintoxicated in July 2006 where he had 36 beers over the course of a weekend.  He now attends AA\nagain and participates in most of the meetings but has not \u201cworked the program\u201d like he should.  In\nthe past he did not work the 12 steps, did not get a home group with a sponsor, and did not do\nservice work.  He intends to work the program one day at a time to acquire more sobriety, but he\nadmitted \u201cI can\u2019t guarantee that I won\u2019t ever drink again.\u201d  (Exhibit 6)  \nAfter receiving the FORM in May 2007, Applicant provided no supplemental or updated\ninformation on the status of his sobriety or involvement with AA or a similar program.\nExcept for a couple of safety violations when he was in the apprentice school from 1997 to\n1990, Applicant reported that he has had an impeccable personnel and attendance record in his 22\nyears with his employer.  (Exhibit 6)  He provided no work or community references nor\nsupplemental information on the status of his employment.\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider in evaluating an\nindividual's security eligibility.  The guidelines are divided into conditions that could raise a security\nconcern and may be disqualifying and conditions that could mitigate security concerns.  In deciding\nwhether to grant or continue an individual's access to classified information, an administrative judge\nweighs the relevant revised Adjudication Guidelines and considers the evidence as a whole.  \n \nThe responsibility for producing evidence initially falls on the Government to demonstrate\nthat it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant's access to\nclassified information.  Then, the Applicant presents evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate in order  to overcome the doubts raised by the Government and to demonstrate persuasively\nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the clearance.  \nUnder the provisions of Executive Order 10865, as amended, and the Directive, a decision\nto grant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only after an affirmative finding\nthat to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest. In reaching the fair and impartial overall\ncommon sense determination, the Administrative Judge may draw only those inferences and\nconclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically provides industrial security clearance\ndecisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the\nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not\nnecessarily a determination as to the allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism of an applicant. An applicant\nmust  meet the guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing\na security clearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\nGuideline J - Criminal Conduct\n\n       \u00b6 31. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include: (a) a single\n3\nserious crime or multiple lesser offenses; (d) individual is currently on parole or probation.\n       \u00b6 32. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: (a) so much time has elapsed since\n4\nthe criminal behavior happened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; (b) the person was\npressured or coerced into committing the act and those pressures are no longer present in the person's life;\n(c) evidence that the person did not commit the offense; (d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation;\nincluding but not limited to the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution,\njob training or higher education, good employment record, or constructive community involvement. \n5\n\u00b6 30.  The Concern: Criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness.  By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness to\ncomply with laws, rules and regulations.\nThe government established security concerns under criminal conduct  over misdemeanor\n3\nalcohol-related  charges and convictions from 1984 to June 2004 \u00b6 1.a. through \u00b6 1.f.).\nDisqualifying conditions include: \u00b6 31.(a), a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses, and \u00b6\n31.(d), individual is currently on parole or probation.  He did not provide any evidence that he\ncompleted his two years of probation required after the November 2004 finding of guilt for his June\n2004 DUI. \n \nOverall Applicant provided insufficient evidence of mitigation.  While Applicant\u2019s earlier\n4\ncriminal conduct from 1984 to1998 can be mitigated under MC \u00b6 32.(a) as so much time has\nelapsed, his 2004 arrest and conviction reflect a repeated and recurrent problem; therefore, security\nconcerns persist over that recent 2004 conviction.  Also, Applicant failed to demonstrate successful\nrehabilitation under MC \u00b6 32.(d).  While it has been three years without any evidence of recurrence\nof any criminal activity since his 2004 DWI arrest, he admitted two alcohol relapses: a relapse in\nDecember 2005 (\u00b6 2.g.) and a relapse in July 2006 (\u00b6 2.h.).  While he confirmed he returned to AA\nin August 2006, he failed to provide evidence of his current abstinence from alcohol as an indicator\nhe will not re-offend, nor did he provide evidence that he has completed his time on probation from\nthe last arrest in 2004.  Also, in considering \u00b6 32(d), Applicant provided insufficient evidence of\nsuccessful rehabilitation, such as constructive community involvement.  While he stated he has a\nfine employment record, that by itself is insufficient to mitigate.  He failed to demonstrate his\nongoing commitment to being alcohol free, so security concerns persist. \nThus, after looking at the whole person and considering the Adjudicative Process factors and\nthe Adjudicative Guidelines, I rule for Applicant on subparagraphs 1.a. through 1.e., but against\nApplicant  on subparagraph 1.f. under SOR Paragraph 1.\nGuideline G --Alcohol Consumption\n\u00b6 21. The Concern. Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable\njudgment or failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability and trustworthiness.\nThe Government established security concerns over Applicant\u2019s problem drinking and his\nsix alcohol-related arrests from 1944 to 2004.  Applicant\u2019s conduct falls within disqualifying\n\n       \u00b6 22. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include: (a) alcohol-\n5\nrelated incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse,\ndisturbing the peace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an\nalcohol abuser or alcohol dependent.   (b) alcohol-related incidents at work, such as reporting for work or duty\nin an intoxicated or impaired condition, or drinking on the job, regardless of whether the individual is\ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent. (c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point\nof impaired judgment,  regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol\ndependent. (d) diagnosis by a credentialed medical professional (e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, or\npsychiatrist) of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence; (e) evaluation of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence\nby a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol treatment program; (f)\nrelapse after diagnosis of alcohol abuse or dependence and completion of  an alcohol rehabilitation program;\n(g) failure to follow any court order regarding alcohol education, evaluation, treatment, or abstinence.\n       \u00b6 23. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:  (a) so much time has passed, or the\n6\nbehavior was so infrequent, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to  recur or\ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgement; (b) the\nindividual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol abuse, provides evidence of actions taken\nto overcome this problem, and has established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or responsible\nuse (if an alcohol abuser); (c) the individual is a current employee who is participating in a counseling or\ntreatment program, has no history of previous treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory progress; (d)\nthe individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient counseling or rehabilitation along with any\nrequired after-care requirements, has demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption\nor abstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as participation in meetings of Alcoholics\nAnonymous or a similar organization, and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified  medical\nprofessional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol treatment\nprogram.\n6\nconditions (DC) \u00b6 22.   In Applicant\u2019s case the relevant DC are \u00b6 22.(a), alcohol-related incidents,\n5\nsuch as driving under the influence, as discussed above, and \u00b6 22. (c), habitual or binge consumption\nof alcohol to the point of impaired judgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as\nan alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent.  Applicant admitted he was diagnosed with alcohol\ndependence and was referred to 26 weeks of treatment in 2005 at an outpatient counseling center.\nHe also admitted he had stated to a DoD investigator in April 2005 that he had no intent to drink\nalcohol in the future.  However, subsequently, he has had two relapses since he completed treatment\nin July 2005.  The most recent alcohol-related arrest in June 2004 and relapses in December 2005\nand July 2006 illustrate Applicant\u2019s questionable judgment:  Applicant made a decision to stop\nattending AA before his relapses.  While he stated he was again attending AA meetings in August\n2006, he provided no updated information on his status in 2007.  It his burden to do so.\nIn sum, even after six alcohol-related arrests, Applicant continued intermittently to drink,\nat times to excess.  Even after Applicant was diagnosed with alcohol dependence, he continued to\ndrink.  Even after treatment and in the face of his own stated desire to stop drinking, he continued\nto drink, at times to excess.  Overall, I conclude that Applicant failed to mitigate these alcohol-\nrelated security concerns.  In light of the seriousness of his repeated arrests over a twenty year period\nand his intermittent recent relapses, he provided insufficient evidence to demonstrate that he fulfills\nthe mitigating conditions.   \n6\n Notably, under MC  \u00b6 23.(a), his 2004 arrest is recent and for periods in 2005 and 2006 he\n\n7\nwas unable to maintain his own resolve to stop drinking.  Given this recency, he does not meet the\ntest that \u201cso much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under such\nunusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d  \nUnder MC \u00b6 23.(b), Applicant has acknowledged issues with alcohol dependence. While he\ndid comply with the court orders to take an alcohol-awareness class, he did not establish his\nabstinence from alcohol in 2007 nor establish that he attends an ongoing individual or group\ntreatment program. Thus, I conclude he failed to establish MC  \u00b6 23.(c), the individual is a current\nemployee who is participating in a counseling or treatment program, has no history of previous\ntreatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory progress. He has shown some positive changes in\nbehavior by his compliance with the court ordered requirements.  On the other hand, he has only a\nlimited record of abstinence from alcohol, so he has not met the expectations of MC \u00b6 23.(d.).  He\nhas not provided a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified  medical professional or a licensed\nclinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol treatment program.  Also, he\nprovided no provided evidence of ongoing and current participation in meetings of Alcoholics\nAnonymous or a similar organization.\nAfter considering the Adjudicative Process factors and the Adjudicative Guidelines, I rule\nagainst Applicant on subparagraphs 2.a. through 2.i. under SOR Paragraph 2.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nAfter reviewing the allegations of the SOR in the context of the Adjudicative Guidelines in\nEnclosure 2 and the factors set forth under the Adjudicative Process section, I make the following\nformal findings:\nParagraph 1.
